		<p>Fortnite is becoming a bug-riddled mess these days… but not in a bad way. No, Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome has littered the Battle Royale Island with bugs as part of The Hive, and is tasking you with joining the O.X.R. (Onimorph eXtermination Rangers) to blast them all away.</p>
<p>And who better to blow up some bugs than UNSC Spartans from the Halo franchise, and the Power Rangers?</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGqbypEMcVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New for the Battle Royale Island are some locations themed after this battle, with the OXR HQ there to dish out orders and sell you weapons, while the Ranger’s Ruin is a former OXR weapons lab that has now been overrun. You’ll face off against Swarmers, Bombers, and burrowing Queens, grabbing new weapons like the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver and a&nbsp;Bug Cannon, and getting to the Hammerhead Choppa to rain fire down from above.</p>
<p>It’s all tied together by the new Battle Pass. Purchasing the pass auto-unlocks the UNSC Spartain, while progression will get you the Green Ranger and, from 16th September, you’ll be able to complete quests to unlock a&nbsp;Dino Megazord Outfit.</p>

<p>Also in the Battle Pass are <span>Yoo-mi, </span><span>Agent Patch, </span>Battle Gamer Mae, Lt. Ripp Slade, and the totally not just a panda version of Nick Fury, Onyx Winter</p>
<p>The rest of the Power Rangers will be kept for a Mighty Morphin Bundle that will hit the Shop in August and includes Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Blue Ranger Outfits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox Games has revealed the fifth and final game that will be included with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-party-pack-11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a> later this year, with Cookie Haus a drawing game that will be sure to be a hit with sweet-toothed artists out there.</p>
<p>Cookie Haus is a cozy drawing game where you decorate cookies to match the prompts, adding layers of icing and sprinkles to match prompts like “a cookie who’s <em>seen</em> some things.” Once cookies have been created, you can then name them and the group you’re playing with with then vote on their favourites &nbsp;for each prompt.</p>
<p><iframe title="The final game in Party Pack 11 is..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb0p6mUjApM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The core thing that sets Cookie Haus apart from our other drawing games is that the drawing interface is built from the ground up to feel very physical,” said Director Chase McClure. “There is something about placing icing and sprinkles on a cookie that makes it more familiar to someone who doesn’t consider themselves an ‘artist.’ But, it also gives this whole new challenge to the Drawful veterans of the group.”</p>

<p>Also included in Jackbox Party Pack 11 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspectives</strong> – There’s been a crime, one player secretly did it, and the evidence comes from your own survey answers! Study the clues, defend your innocence (even if you’re lying), and put your friends on trial.</li>
<li><strong>Doominate</strong> – Take all that is perfectly lovely and destroy it in a head-to-head joke game where the funniest answer is exalted.</li>
<li><strong>Legends of Trivia</strong> – Are you looking for a fantasy trivia game with RPG-inspired elements? Oh boy, do I have some good news for you!</li>
<li><strong>Hear Say</strong> – In Hear Say, you’ll be putting your pipes to work to create hilarious soundscapes. Use your phone as a controller, just like all Jackbox party pack games. But in this one, you get to use the microphone on your phone to get real sound effects that work in the game!</li>
</ul>

<p>Picture Purrfect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year's delightful cat sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_kitty_big_city">Little Kitty, Big City</a>, made a surprise appearance in today's Indie World showcase to reveal the upcoming 'Picture Purrfect' update, set to land on Switch on <strong>27th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The headline addition in this one is a photo mode, hence the name, but the newbie that we're most excited to see — like, punching the air excited — is a all-new cat customisation menu, where you can tweak your cat's looks however you please.</p>
<p>Will we making our own cats and immediately filling our screenshot albums with hundreds of pictures of them? You bet we will be! It looks like there are options for markings, eye and fur colour, coat softness and more, so expect to find us closely examining our cats as if we were a fine artist preparing to paint their model.</p>

<p>The Picture Purrfect update also includes new spots in the neighbourhood to visit, a collection of new characters and, of course, even more hats for you to stick on your kitty.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks adorable, and it's completely free! For more information on the base game, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/little-kitty-big-city">our full review</a> below.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-co-op-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-new-mod-introduces-a-cool-co-op-mode.1264674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-nuclear-disarmament-unlocked-legitimately/">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a> multiplayer features have been expanded this week by a new mod, which introduces a co-op mode that promises to make the experience more fun than ever before, even with its issues.</p>



<p>The mod, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite">developer's unknown 321 GitHub page</a>, has been in the works for some time, and its development was far from simple, as the developer behind the project had to address many issues, as detailed in a <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite/blob/master/docs/MAKING_OF.md">making-of document.</a> Ultimately, some couldn't be addressed, but the developer decided to release the mod in a semi-working state with some of the planned features missing as well as they believed this could be a solid foundation for a new generation of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain mods that could possibly make the modded co-op mode as fun as the official mode in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@caplag">caplag.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is currently the final entry in the series, and the last one to be directed by Hideo Kojima, the series seems to be far from done. In October 2023, Konami released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-4k-resolution-support/">Master Collection Vol. 1</a>, including the first three 3D entries in the series as well as the classic first 2D entries in the series, which could be followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">second collection</a> that may also end the PlayStation 3 exclusivity of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In addition, the third entry in the series, which is considered one of the best entries in the series to date, is returning to modern PC and consoles later <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">this month</a> with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake built in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos that aims to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">improve the game</a> without altering what makes it such a beloved stealth title.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-will-reportedly-launch-on-october-16-2025.1264671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>, the new handheld PCs built from a collaboration between ASUS and Microsoft will reportedly launch this coming October 16, 2025. </p>



<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Billbil-kun over at Dealabs</a>, the reliable leaker who has previously correctly leaked release date times and retail prices for multiple devices, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">recently reported the prices</a> for the handhelds, with the cheaper ROG Xbox Ally listed at €599, and the more expensive ROG Xbox Ally X at €899. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun also recently reported that<a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/"> pre-orders for the handhelds</a> would start at Gamescom 2025, which lines up with the official confirmation from Microsoft that it would be giving players their first chance at going <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">hands-on with the handhelds during Gamescom 2025</a>. </p>



<p>And as Billbil-kun mentions in their report, this October release date lines up with previous rumors from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPdijzg6Ug">eXtas1s</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">others</a> who have already identified October as a release window for the device. Dealabs is now the first to put a specific date to the leak. </p>



<p>So, as it stands, the official word from Microsoft is that we'll get the chance to try out the handheld at Gamescom 2025. Billbil-kun, who has now built up a strong reputation for reporting accurate retail information on videogame products ahead of their official reveal, has pegged pre-orders to kick off at Gamescom, along with the price reveal, and a release date, the final piece of the puzzle. </p>



<p>Save for the ROG Xbox Ally being at Gamescom, while everything else technically remains in rumor territory, Billbil-kun and their sources have so rarely missed the mark, that it's worth betting we'll see a full official reveal of the price and release date for these handhelds during Gamescom ONL on Tuesday, August 19, ahead of the Gamescom festivities that'll occur throughout the rest of the week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-framework-desktop-made-me-fall-for-small-form-factor-pcs.1264668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework has built a name for itself by taking the locked down world of laptops and making them modular, upgradable, and repairable. So it’s surprising — and maybe even controversial — the way that Framework has approached its first desktop: it’s made a PC that’s actually <em>less </em>modular than most.</p><p>Don’t worry; this isn’t a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">Mac Mini</a> situation, where mere mortals are not meant to touch the innards of such a brilliant little computer. But it’s not a traditional small form factor PC, either.</p><p>The Framework Desktop is impressively small for what it offers. It’s around the size of a couple hardcover novels standing on your desk. Its black-and-silver case is just large enough to fit a mini-ITX motherboard, a cooler, and a power supply — plus two modular front ports and a customizable array of 21 plastic tiles on the front panel, just for fun. And its AMD Strix Halo APU is surprisingly powerful. Even the base configuration is capable of respectable gaming frame rates at 2.5K resolution, and the highest-end spec, with a more powerful processor and 128GB of shared memory, is enough to run beefy local large language models like Llama 3.3 70B.</p><p>Yes, you can buy or build a bigger, more powerful small-form-factor desktop, and it’ll actually be more upgradeable than the Framework. And if you just want a tiny desktop for the basics, there are plenty of brands offering cheaper prebuilts. But none of them are quite like the Framework Desktop. It’s a simple, compact computer that’s good enough for serious gaming or content creation and doesn’t come with a shred of bloatware. It’s incredibly easy to assemble (you don’t even have to apply thermal paste), competently powerful, and its design is endearing and unmistakably Framework.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1099</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Tiny 4.5-liter desktop PC</li><li>One of the easiest building and upgrading experiences</li><li>Enough graphics power for 2.5K gaming</li><li>Configurable with 128GB of RAM for working with local AI models</li><li>Not a lick of bloatware (aside from Windows itself)</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Not for 4K gaming unless you bump settings way, way down</li><li>CPU, GPU, and RAM are all integrated and can’t be upgraded outside of changing the mainboard</li><li>No x16 PCIe slot</li><li>Similarly priced prebuilt PCs get you more gaming performance</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="configurations-and-build-quality"><h2><strong>Configurations and build quality</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Fdesktop-diy-amd-aimax300%2Fconfiguration%2Fnew">Framework Desktop</a>’s mainboard is built around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s Strix Halo APU</a>: a single, beefy chip that contains both CPU and graphics cores. The base config starts with a Ryzen AI Max 385 chip (8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores) and 32GB of shared RAM for $1,099. The Max Plus 395 models (16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores) come with 64GB or 128GB of RAM for $1,599 and $1,999, respectively. At each level, that price gets you the mainboard with a preinstalled cooler and Wi-Fi module, the case, and a 400W FlexATX power supply.</p><p>Adding a power cord, Cooler Master CPU fan, two modular front expansion cards, a Windows license, a 512GB SSD, and the requisite front-panel tiles, will run you at least $287 more. Of course, you can spend extra for more storage (which you should, given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">the size of modern games</a>), a higher-end fan like a Noctua, or additional front-panel cards. Aside from Framework’s proprietary hot-swappable expansion cards, you can source all those components yourself if you already have them or find them cheaper elsewhere.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>At just under seven pounds, it’s easy to transport this little guy to any LAN party or BYOC event, especially if you get the handle.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Our $1,600-ish review unit came with the Ryzen AI Max 385 mainboard, two 1TB SSDs, a base fan, optional carry handle (“coming soon”), translucent side panel, Windows 11 Pro, a power cord, and a variety of expansion cards and fun tiles for the front. Framework also sent the Max Plus 395 mainboard with 128GB of RAM (which can also be purchased separately for <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Fframework-desktop-mainboard-amd-ryzen-ai-max-300-series%3Fv%3DFRAFMK0006">$1,699</a> to put into your own Mini-ITX case) and a third 1TB SSD, so I could benchmark the higher-spec config and try the DIY upgrade.</p><p>Like Framework’s DIY Editions for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300">Laptop 13</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel">Laptop 12</a>, the Desktop is a partially prebuilt affair. You’re just installing the fan, up to two NVMe SSDs, two front expansion cards, front panel tiles, and attaching the carry handle (which I think is a must-buy for the fun of it, though it’s not yet available for order, and Framework has yet to confirm its price). The OS install will likely take you longer than the initial hardware setup.</p><p>Build quality is top-notch all around, and the shell and inner frame of the case are intuitively designed. It’s just big enough to hold the motherboard and power supply, with the 120mm CPU fan pulling in air through the perforated side panel and over the APU cooler’s large radiator, from which it exhausts from the rear panel. There’s also a spot for a 80mm fan under the front magnetic cover, if you favor a little more positive airflow.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The outer panels are plastic, but they’re securely fit with easily unlockable clips — just remove the top panel’s thumb screws and everything else easily unlocks by hand. The decorative front is attached magnetically, and its 21 interchangeable tiles easily pop out for simple rearranging. Inside the chassis, the included screwdriver with Torx and Philips heads are all you need to install / change out the fan, SSDs, and mainboard.</p><p>Framework’s step-by-step guide on swapping out mainboards was not available to me during our review period, but I figured it out on my own and changed from a 385 to the 395 in a little under an hour. That’s how well put together and logical the desktop’s chassis design is: if you’ve worked on PCs before (even if, like me, the last time you built one was 2013), then you can easily putz around and find your way. It was simple to remove the clearly labeled screws securing the board and top rail of the chassis frame. The CPU cooler and even the rear I/O shield are attached to the mainboard, so they all come out together. The only moment that gave me pause was realizing the Wi-Fi module mounted to the rear of the board — which I had to swap from one mainboard to the other — needed a fresh thermal pad, but luckily I had some extras from an old SSD enclosure.</p><div><p id="ryzen-ai-max-385-max-plus-395-benchmark-performance"><h2><strong>Ryzen AI Max 385 / Max Plus 395 benchmark performance</strong></h2></p></div><p>I first tested the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 APU in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review">Asus ROG Flow Z13</a>. This is the chip that proved to me integrated graphics aren’t just a laughingstock — it could even hold its own in 2.5K gaming. But that was on a tablet, and this is a desktop PC, with a 400W power supply and much better cooling, and that makes a difference. The Framework Desktop’s lower-end 385 chip came close to or even beat the higher-end 395 chip in the ROG Flow Z13. Both its 385 and 395 chips bested the ROG Flow tablet in various game benchmarks, like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, despite the Asus still managing to take them in a few single-core tests like Geekbench and Cinebench.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Framework Desktop / AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 / 8C / 32C / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Framework Desktop / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 / 16C / 40C / 128GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Flow Z13 / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 / 16C / 40C / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Mac Mini M4 / 10C / 10C / 16GB / 512GB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro / 14C / 20C / 48GB / 2TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>2944</td><td>2961</td><td>2986</td><td>3889</td><td>3976</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>13673</td><td>17484</td><td>19845</td><td>14915</td><td>22615</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>82536</td><td>86948</td><td>80819</td><td>37256</td><td>70018</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>114</td><td>115</td><td>116</td><td>176</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1065</td><td>1927</td><td>1450</td><td>945</td><td>1744</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>9726</td><td>10951</td><td>10515</td><td>Not tested</td><td>12374</td></tr><tr><td>Premiere 4K Export</td><td>3 minutes, 5 seconds</td><td>2 minutes, 34 seconds</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td><td>2 minutes, 13 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy graphics score (1080p)</td><td>14940</td><td>17620</td><td>12043</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the Framework, the higher-end chip was 16 percent faster on average in gaming benchmarks than the lower end one. I don’t think that justifies spending an additional $500 if you’re interested in the Framework mainly as a small gaming rig. The top-end Strix Halo chip is billed <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fdesktop%3Ftab%3Dgaming%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAn%2520APU%2520that%2520punches%2520above%2520its%2520weight.">by Framework</a> as offering RTX 4070 laptop-level graphics performance without the need for a discrete GPU, and that bears out against our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a> tests from last year — which ran the RTX 4060, one rung below the 4070. Both the 385 and 395 Desktop mainboards handily beat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"><em>The Verge’s</em> perennial</a> darling of a gaming laptop. The 385 falls just shy of matching the newer 2025 version of the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white%2F6629420.p" rel="sponsored">Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 5060</a>, while the 395 still edges it out. Impressive.</p><div><p id="everyday-performance"><h2><strong>Everyday performance</strong></h2></p></div><p>When it comes to actually playing games, you can expect solid frame rates at 2.5K (2560 x 1440 or 1600) resolution at low-to-medium settings, depending on the game. Your indies and live service games like <em>Fortnite</em> that work on most anything should run easily at high frame rates. I played a bunch of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> on the Framework, and it ran just fine. FromSoftware games are not the best optimized titles, but I could play on the 385 mainboard with medium settings at 2560 x 1440 and stay in the 50fps range. Playing it on the 395 allowed a crisper 4K resolution at medium for a similar 50-or-slightly-below fps — or I could keep it at 2.5K and maintain the game’s 60fps ceiling.</p><p>I assumed indie breakout <em>Peak</em> would play great even at max settings at 4K, but I underestimated the resource demands of its big mountain. I had to keep <em>Peak’s </em>cartoony graphics set to medium, as well, but that ensured my comedic in-game falls were running well above 70fps to 80fps at 4K resolution. On the 395, I could push to high settings for about the same.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Outside of gaming, the Framework Desktop in any of its mainboard configurations is more than capable for everyday productivity stuff and my usual work. The fan often goes whisper quiet when multitasking across simple mixed-use tasks like messaging apps, working in a document, and listening to music or streaming a YouTube video with a bunch of Chrome tabs open. You’ll hear it spin up for some short stretches, but it quickly quiets back down until you’re doing something more intensive. And I’ve yet to encounter any thermal throttling that impacts performance. As much as I love laptops, a compact and quiet desktop that’s flush with ports is such a treat, especially when I can choose those front ports.</p><p>The Framework is also a solid mini workstation for creative apps. Both the 385 and 395 chips beat out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> in our Premiere Pro 4K video export test. And the 395 board trailed the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro chip by just 21 seconds. The 395 and all that RAM spoiled me a bit when importing 60-megapixel RAW photos into Lightroom Classic. It zipped through that import and a quick light-touch edit without any noticeable slowdown — though the fan was quite audible.</p><div><p id="the-framework-desktop-vs-alternatives"><h2><strong>The Framework Desktop vs. alternatives</strong></h2></p></div><p>I mentioned earlier that the Framework Desktop is actually less modular than most desktops. That has its benefits and its drawbacks. It uses a standard mini-ITX motherboard form factor, but because it uses a mobile APU with integrated memory, you can’t upgrade the chip or RAM without replacing the whole board. And you can’t upgrade the graphics, either; there’s no PCIe x16 slot, and while there’s an PCIe x4 connector, the default case doesn’t give you any room to use it.</p><p>The Strix Halo chip in the Framework Desktop is as good as integrated graphics get right now. If you want better gaming performance in a small form factor, you’ll need to get a traditional mini-ITX motherboard and find a 10- or 15-liter case that fits a desktop GPU and processor. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">accommodating that GPU and a desktop CPU is a pain in the ass</a>, from component selection to cable management to cooling. It’s no wonder that many owners give up and leave off side panels or just say “eff it” and cut holes in cases — they’ve even made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffspc/">a subreddit to commiserate</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>With the Framework Desktop, you give up some of that potential in exchange for a desktop that’s dead simple to build and maintain. But it’s a truism that you can get more power for less money if you go bigger.</p><p>Even prebuilts in the $1,000 range rocking a <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-gaming-desktop---intel-core-ultra-5-225f--nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060---windows-11-home--32gb-ram--2tb-ssd.product.4000375234.html" rel="sponsored">low</a>-to-<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/ibuypower-y40-liquid-cooled-gaming-pc---amd-ryzen-7-9700x----geforce-rtx-5070---windows-11---32-gb-ram---2tb-ssd---black.product.4000366690.html" rel="sponsored">mid</a> 50-series desktop card are going to beat the Framework Desktop in games.

A 16-liter case is decently compact, and if you’re just looking for an affordable turn-key gaming machine, it’s likely a-ok. But 16L is more than three times the 4.5L Framework Desktop. And many prebuilt machines are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-d8P_7gqp0">notorious for cutting corners</a> or having limitations to what further upgrades you can put into them.</p><p>When it comes to desktops the size of the Framework or smaller, you’re in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fdisplays-desktops%2Fnucs%2Fall-series%2Ffilter%3FSeries%3DNUC-Mini-PCs" rel="sponsored">Asus NUC</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac Mini</a> territory. There are also thin clients, like the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fdesktops%2Fthinkcentre%2Fm-series-tiny%2Flenovo-thinkcentre-m75q-gen-5-tiny-amd%2Flen102c0051" rel="sponsored">Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny</a>, but they are more enterprise-focused, with modest specs. And several other small-form-factor Strix Halo desktops are beginning to crop up. HP already has its <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-z2-mini-g1a-workstation-desktop-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-bn8e0ua-aba-1" rel="sponsored">Z2 Mini G1a</a> that’s smaller than the Framework, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/desktop-computers/715282/corsair-ai-workstation-300-framework-desktop">Corsair recently announced</a> an upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/desktop-computers/715282/corsair-ai-workstation-300-framework-desktop">AI Workstation 300</a>, but none of these are upgradeable like the Framework Desktop.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Framework Desktop is an adorably fun PC that makes building and owning a small form factor computer dead easy. Sure, it can’t stack up to the performance of full-size builds, small form factor gaming PCs with discrete GPUs, or prebuilts in the same price range. However, it’s a unique alternative if you want a tiny PC for lighter / 2.5K gaming, media creation, or running local AI models. Like a lot of Framework stuff, it’s slightly niche, there’s nothing else quite like it, and though it’s affordable-ish, you’re still paying a bit of a premium compared to more conventional alternatives.</p><p>Having such a tiny thing sit on my desk and deliver solid gaming performance got me to start rethinking my neverending pursuit of higher graphical fidelity. Do I really need to endure the constant fan noise of a gaming laptop or worry about a power-hungry GPU in a full-size desktop adding to my monthly electricity bill? Maybe a fun little machine that delivers good enough graphics is, well, good enough.</p><div><div><p id="framework-desktop-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>Framework Desktop specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 (8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores) / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 (16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores)</span></li><li><span><strong>Shared memory:</strong> 32GB (AI Max 385) / 128GB (AI Max Plus 395)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 x 1TB SSD</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth</span></li><li><span><strong>Rear ports:</strong> HDMI 2.1, 2x DisplayPort 2.1, 2x USB4, 1x RJ45 ethernet, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 3.5mm combo audio jack</span></li><li><span><strong>Front ports:</strong> 2x modular expansion card slots (USB-C based)</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.83 pounds / 3.1kg</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.81 x 8.09 x 8.9 inches / 96.8 x 205.5 x 226.1 mm</span></li><li><span><strong>Price (Ryzen AI Max 385):</strong> $1,099</span></li><li><span><strong>Price (Ryzen AI Max Plus 395):</strong> $1,999</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Forza Motorsport’s</em> social media account seems dead. <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting new DLC. And <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta is a smash hit that seems to indicate EA’s choice to recreate <em>Battlefield 3</em> was a smart one. Plus an ugly Atari 2600 and some cool <em>Kotaku</em> stories you might have missed. Yes, folks, it’s time once again for Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, trailers, and cool shit.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Is A Massive Hit On Steam</strong></h2> <p>I knew there was a lot of excitement for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which is launching this October on Xbox, PS5, and PC, but I didn’t realize just how many people were apparently ready for a new, grounded <em>BF</em> game. Turns out a lot of people want to play this new installment in EA’s military sim shooter series. On Steam alone, the open beta has already hit over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">330,000 concurrent players</a>. And this is despite <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953403767107264869?">numerous server issues and long queues</a>. Also, keep in mind that this session of the “open” beta isn’t actually open. You need an early access code to join in right now. I imagine <em>Battlefield</em> devs (and EA as a whole) are very excited about the high numbers. We’ll see how much higher the player count goes later this week when the beta goes truly open.</p> <h2><strong><em>Castle Crashers</em>‘ First New DLC In A Decade Is Out Now</strong></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Castle Crashers: Painter Boss Paradise DLC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>2008’s <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting some new DLC today. <a href="https://kotaku.com/castle-crashers-first-dlc-in-12-years-lets-you-make-you-1851606535">As previously announced,</a> the beloved cartoon brawler from the XBLA days is getting a big upgrade via the Painter Boss Paradise DLC. This $4 expansion is available now on Steam and adds a new world map, a new official character named Paint Junior, some quality-of-life changes, and the ability to create your own playable characters, too.</p>

 <h2><strong>What’s Up With The<em> Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter Account?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>So here’s something odd. The official <em>Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1943342994662310309">hasn’t tweeted anything since July 10.</a> This is strange, as <em>Forza Motorsport</em> is a live-service game that, in theory, is frequently being updated with new content and events. You’d think Xbox or Turn 10 would want to keep people updated on the game’s status or at least tweet something here and there to remind people that the game is alive and still active. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1953142509238198413?t=Z_WE72dEIAGv86xMmehTBA&amp;s=19">But as pointed out by Destin Legarie,</a> it seems the account has gone dormant. What does that mean in the wake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">layoffs at Turn 10 and Xbox</a>? Probably nothing good.</p> <h2><strong>A very yellow Atari 2600 is now available for pre-order</strong></h2> <p>A new, version of the Atari 2600+ (a modern spin on the retro console that can play the old carts) is now available for pre-order. But it doesn’t feature the console’s iconic faux wood veneer.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"> Instead, it is painted a bright, obnoxious yellow in honor of </a><em>Pac-Man.</em> This special edition of the console arrives in October and will cost you $170. It does come with a wireless controller and two different versions of <em>Pac-Man.</em> First is a new game, <em>Pac-Man 7800</em>, which is a fresh port of the classic arcade game. The other included cart is the 2600 version of <em>Pac-Man</em>, which might be the worst way to play the game in 2025. Yay? Anyway, if you want a really ugly Atari 2600+, you can pre-order this now.</p> <h2>Park building sickos should check out this <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> trailer</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Shaping Your Parks | Feature Focus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PYojm22uV0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The first two <em>Jurassic World Evolution</em> games had totally serviceable terrain modification tools and options. But the upcoming <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is going to the next level, letting you build waterfalls and even use cliffs and valleys to contain your various dinos.

I’m going to lose a large chunk of my life to this game, and I’m so fucking excited.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">We’ve learned a lot about <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer since its reveal last week</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">Nintendo of America at one point in time wanted to give Pikachu big boobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">Take a look behind the scenes of a massive AAA video game reveal</a></li> </ul>

<p>When Battlefield 6 launches, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected that AI bots</a> will be used to fill out matches should there not be enough players. In the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, however, AI bots won’t be everywhere.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the official Battlefield 6 communications team clarified how bots, or “AI soldiers” will work during the game’s beta.</p>



<p>“AI Soldiers are only present on the “Training Grounds” playlists within the Open Beta,” <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953431583223943500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the team said</a>. “This week is ‘Breakthrough Initiation’.</p>



<p>“Breakthrough Initiation is a playlist that allows you to experience Breakthrough alongside 15 other players, with additional AI Soldiers filling up the match thereafter.”</p>



<p>DICE says that Training Grounds playlists are available to “introduce people to the core elements of Breakthrough, and offer a smoother experience than a full lobby.”</p>



<p>“Additionally, you can experience Breakthrough without AI Soldiers by playing Breakthrough from the “Featured” playlist row,” they added. “Training Grounds is only available for the first 15 ranks, at which point it will disappear from the front end.”</p>



<p>Currently, Battlefield 6’s Beta is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being filled by hundreds of thousands</a> of players ahead of the official start of the “open” portion on August 9. If players were worried about bots being a part of traditional matches, it appears that won’t be the case.</p>



<p>As mentioned, however, the game is expected to use bots to fill up lobbies should there not be enough players for a match. They can also be used, as DICE’s Jac Carlsson said, when creating a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to practice and improve at the game.</p>



<p>Are you playing the Battlefield 6 beta this weekend or next? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Framework’s main claim to fame is its commitment to modular, upgradeable, repairable laptops. The jury’s still out on early 2024’s Framework Laptop 16 and mid-2025’s Framework Laptop 12, neither of which has seen a hardware refresh, but so far, the company has released half a dozen iterations of its flagship Framework Laptop 13 in less than five years. If you bought one of the originals right when it first launched, you could go to Framework’s site, buy an all-new motherboard and RAM, and get a substantial upgrade in performance and other capabilities without having to change anything else about your laptop.</p>
<p>Framework’s laptops haven’t been adopted as industry-wide standards, but in many ways, they seem built to reflect the flexibility and modularity that has drawn me to desktop PCs for more than two decades.</p>
<p>That's what makes the Framework Desktop so weird. Not only is Framework navigating into a product category where its main innovation and claim to fame is totally unnecessary. But it’s actually doing that with a desktop that’s <em>less</em> upgradeable and modular than any given self-built desktop PC.</p>
<p>The Framework Desktop has a lot of interesting design touches, and it's automatically a better buy than the weird AMD Ryzen AI Max-based mini desktops you can buy from a couple of no-name manufacturers. But aside from being more considerate of PC industry standards, the Framework Desktop asks the same question that any gaming-focused mini PC does: Do you care about having a small machine so much that you would pay more money for less performance, and for a system you can't upgrade much after you buy it?</p>
<h2>Design and assembly</h2>

<p>My DIY Edition Framework Desktop arrived in a cardboard box that was already as small or a bit smaller than my usual desktop PC, a mini ITX build with a dedicated GPU inside a 14.67-liter <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshlicious?variant=37165949616312">SSUPD Meshlicious</a> case. It's not a huge system, especially for something that can fit a GeForce RTX 5090 in it. But three of the 4.5-liter Framework Desktops could fit inside my build's case with a little space leftover.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The PC itself is buried a couple of layers deep in this box under some side panels and whatever fan you choose (Framework offers RGB and non-RGB options from Cooler Master and Noctua, but any 120 mm fan will fit on the heatsink). Even for the DIY Edition, the bulk of it is already assembled: the motherboard is in the case, a large black heatsink is already perched atop the SoC, and both the power supply and front I/O ports are already hooked up.</p>
<p>The aspiring DIYer mainly needs to install the SSD and the fan to get going. Putting in these components gives you a decent crash course in how the system goes together and comes apart. The primary M.2 SSD slot is under a small metal heat spreader next to the main heatsink—loosen one screw to remove it, and install your SSD of choice. The system's other side panel can be removed to expose a second M.2 SSD slot and the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, letting you install or replace either.</p>
<p>Lift the small handles on the two top screws and loosen them by hand to remove them, and the case's top panel slides off. This provides easier access to both the CPU fan header and RGB header, so you can connect the fan after you install it and its plastic shroud on top of the heatsink. That's pretty much it for assembly, aside from sliding the various panels back in place to close the thing up and reinstalling the top screws (or, if you bought or printed one, adding a handle to the top of the case).</p>

      The Framework Desktop includes a beefier version of Framework's usual screwdriver with a longer bit.

<p>Framework includes a beefier version of its typical screwdriver with the Desktop, including a bit that can be pulled out and reversed to be switched between Phillips and Torx heads. The iFixit-style install instructions are clearly written and include plenty of high-resolution sample images so you can always tell how things are supposedto look.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The front of the system requires some assembly, too, but all of this stuff can be removed and replaced easily without opening up the rest of the system. The front panel, where the system's customizable tiles can be snapped on and popped off, attaches with magnets and can easily be pried away from the desktop with your fingernails. At the bottom are slots for two of Framework's USB-C Expansion Cards, the same ones that all the Framework Laptops use.</p>

<p>By default, those ports are limited to 5 Gbps USB transfer speeds in the BIOS, something the system says reduces wireless interference; those with all-wired networking and accessories can presumably enable the full 10 Gbps speeds without downsides. The front ports should support all of the Expansion Cards <em>except</em> for display outputs, which they aren't wired for. (I also had issues getting the Desktop to boot from a USB port on the front of the system while installing Windows, but your mileage may vary; using one of the rear USB ports solved the issue for me.)</p>
<h3>Standards, sometimes</h3>

<p>What puts the Framework Desktop above mini PCs from Amazon or the various gaming NUCs that Intel and Asus have released over the years is a commitment to standards.</p>
<p>For reasons we'll explore later, there was no way to build the system around this specific AMD chip without using soldered-on memory. But the motherboard is a regular mini ITX-sized motherboard. Other ITX boards will fit into Framework's case, and the Framework Laptop's motherboard will fit into other systems (as long as they can also fit the fan and heatsink).</p>
<p>The 400 W power supply conforms to the FlexATX standard. The CPU fan is just a regular 120 mm fan, and the mounting holes for system fans on the front can take any 92 mm fan. The two case fan headers on the motherboard are the same ones you'd find on any motherboard you bought for yourself. The front panel ports can't be used for display outputs, but anything else ought to work.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Few elements of the Framework Desktop are truly proprietary, and if Framework went out of business tomorrow, you'd still have a lot of flexibility for buying and installing replacement parts. The problem is that the soldered-down, non-replaceable, non-upgradeable parts are the CPU, GPU, and RAM. There's at least a little flexibility with the graphics card if you move the board into a different case—there's a single PCIe x4 slot on the board that you could put an external GPU into, though many PCIe x16 graphics cards will be bandwidth starved. But left in its original case, it's an easy-to-work-on, standards-compliant system that will also never be any better or get any faster than it is the day you buy it.</p>
<h3>Hope you like plastic</h3>

<p>The interior of the Framework Desktop is built of sturdy metal, thoughtfully molded to give easy access to each of the ports and components on the motherboard. My main beef with the system is the outside.</p>
<p>The front and side panels of the Framework Desktop are all made out of plastic. The clear side panel, if you spring for it, is made of a thick acrylic instead of tempered glass (presumably because Framework has drilled holes in the side of it to improve airflow).</p>
<p>This isn't the end of the world, but the kinds of premium ITX PC cases that the Desktop is competing with are predominantly made of nicer-looking and nicer-feeling metal rather than plastic. It just feels surprisingly cheap, which was an unpleasant surprise—even the plastic Framework Laptop 12 felt sturdy and high-quality, something I can't really say of the Desktop's exterior panels.</p>
<p>I do like the design on the front panel—a grid of 21 small square plastic tiles that users can rearrange however they want. Framework sells tiles with straight and diagonal lines on them, plus individual tiles with different logos or designs printed or embossed on them. If you install a fan in the front of the system, you'll want to stick to the lined tiles in the top 9 x 9 section of the grid, which will allow air to pass through. The tiles with images on them are solid—putting a couple of them in front of a fan likely won't hurt your airflow too much, but you won't want to use too many.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Framework has also <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Desktop">published basic templates</a> for both the tiles and the top panel so that those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">with 3D printers</a> can make their own.</p>

<h2>PC testbed notes</h2>
<p>We've compared the performance of the Framework Desktop to a bunch of other PCs to give you a sense of how it stacks up to full-size desktops. We've also compared it to the Ryzen 7 8700G in a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B650I-AORUS-ULTRA">Gigabyte B650I Aorus Ultra</a> mini ITX motherboard with 32GB of DDR5-6400 to show the best performance you can expect from a similarly sized socketed desktop system.</p>
<p>Where possible, we've also included some numbers from the M4 Pro Mac mini and the M4 Max Mac Studio, two compact desktops in the same general price range as the Framework Desktop.</p>
<p>For our game benchmarks, the dedicated GPU results were gathered using our GPU testbed, which you can read about in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">our latest dedicated GPU review</a>. The integrated GPUs were obviously tested with the CPUs they're attached to.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>Our Framework-provided review unit was the highest-end option; it has a 16-core Ryzen AI Max+395 processor, 40 graphics cores, and 128GB of RAM. At $1,999 before adding an SSD, a fan, an OS, front tiles, or Expansion Cards, this is the best, priciest configuration Framework offers. The $1,599 configuration uses the same chip with the same performance, but with 64GB of RAM instead.</p>
<p>All 16 of those CPU cores are based on the Zen 5 architecture, with none of the smaller-but-slower Zen 5c cores. But its total TDP is also limited to 120 W in total, which will hold it back a bit compared to socketed 16-core desktop CPUs like the Ryzen 9 9950X, which has a 170 W default TDP for the CPU alone.</p>


<p>In our testing, it seems clear that the CPU throttles when being tasked with intensive multi-core work like our Handbrake test, with temperatures that spike to around 100 degrees Celsius and hang out at around or just under that number for the duration of our test runs. The CPU package uses right around 100 W on average (this will vary based on the tests you're running and how long you're running them), compared to the 160 W and 194 W that the 12- and 16-core Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X can consume at their default power levels.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Those are socketed desktop chips in huge cases being cooled by large AIO watercooling loops, so it's hardly a fair comparison. The Framework Desktop's CPU is also quite efficient, using even less power to accomplish our video encoding test than the 9950X in its 105 W Eco Mode. But this is the consequence of prioritizing a small size—a 16-core processor that, under heavy loads, performs more like a 12-core or even an 8-core desktop processor.</p>
<p>The upside is that the Framework Desktop is quieter than most desktops either under load or when idling. By default, the main CPU fan will turn off entirely when the system is under light load, and I often noticed it parking itself when I was just browsing or moving files around.</p>




<p>Based on our gaming tests, the Framework Desktop should be a competent 1080p-to-1440p &nbsp;midrange gaming system. We observed similar performance from the Radeon 8060S integrated GPU when we tested it in the Asus ROG Flow Z13 tablet. For an integrated GPU, it's head and shoulders over anything you can get in a socketed desktop system, and it easily ran three or four times faster than the Radeon 780M in the 8700G. The soldered RAM is annoying, but the extra speed it enables helps address the memory bandwidth problem that starves most integrated GPUs.</p>
<p>Compared to other desktop GPUs, though, the 8060S is merely fine. It's usually a little slower than the last-generation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-radeon-7600-xt-offers-peace-of-mind-via-lots-of-ram-remains-a-midrange-gpu/">Radeon RX 7600 XT</a>, a card that cost $329 when it launched in early 2024—and with a performance hit that's slightly more pronounced in games with ray-tracing effects on.</p>
<p>The 8060S stacks up OK to older midrange GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3060 and 4060, but it's soundly beaten by the RTX 5060 or the 16GB version of the Radeon RX 9060 XT, cards currently available for $300-to-$400. (One problem for the 8060S—it's based on the RDNA3.5 architecture, so it's missing ray-tracing performance improvements introduced in RDNA4 and the RX 9000 series).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>All of that said, the GPU may be more interesting than it looks on paper for people whose workloads need gobs and gobs of graphics memory but who <em>don't</em> necessarily need that memory to be attached to the blazing-fastest GPU that exists. For people running certain AI or machine learning workloads, the 8060S's unified memory setup means you can get a GPU with 64GB or 128GB of VRAM for less than the price of a single RTX 5090 (Framework says the GPU can use up to 112GB of RAM on the 128GB Desktop). Framework is <a href="https://frame.work/blog/using-a-framework-desktop-for-local-ai">advertising that use case pretty extensively</a>, and it offers a guide to setting up large language models to run locally on the system.</p>
<p>That memory would likely be even&nbsp;<em>more</em> useful if it were attached to an Nvidia GPU instead of an AMD model—Nvidia's hold on the workstation graphics market is at least as tight as its hold on the gaming GPU market, and many apps and tools support Nvidia GPUs and CUDA first/best/only. But it's still one possible benefit the Framework Desktop might offer, relative to a desktop with a dedicated GPU.</p>
<h2>You can’t say it isn’t unique</h2>

      The Framework Desktop is a bit like a PC tower blended with Apple's Mac Studio.

<p>In one way, Framework has done the same thing with the Desktop that it has done with all its laptops: found a niche and built a product to fill it. And with its standard-size components and standard connectors, the Framework Desktop is a clear cut above every Intel gaming NUC or Asus ROG thingamajig that’s ever existed.</p>
<p>I’m always impressed by the creativity, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail that Framework brings to its builds. For the Desktop, this is partially offset by how much I don’t care for most of its cheap plastic-and-acrylic exterior. But it’s still thoughtfully designed on the&nbsp;<em>inside</em>, with as much respect for standards, modularity, and repairability as you can get, once you get past that whole thing where that the major functional components are all irrevocably soldered together.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The Framework Desktop is also quiet, cute, and reasonably powerful. You're paying some extra money and giving up both CPU and GPU speed to get something small. But you won't run into games or apps that simply refuse to run for performance-related reasons.</p>
<p>It does feel like a weird product for Framework to build, though. It's not that I can't imagine the kind of person a Framework Desktop might be good for—it's that I think Framework has built its business targeting a PC enthusiast demographic that will mainly be turned off by the desktop's lack of upgradeability.</p>
<p>The Framework desktop is an interesting option for people who want or need a compact and easy-to-build workstation or gaming PC, or a Windows-or-Linux version of Apple's Mac Studio. It will fit comfortably under a TV or in a cramped office. It's too bad that it isn't easier to upgrade. But for people who would prefer the benefits of a socketed CPU or a swappable graphics card, I'm sure the people at Framework would be the first ones to point you in the direction of a good-old desktop PC.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solid all-round performance and good power efficiency.</li>
<li>The Radeon 8060S is exceptionally good for an integrated GPU, delivering much better performance than you can get in something like the Ryzen 7 8700G.</li>
<li>Large pool of RAM available to the GPU could be good for machine learning and AI workloads.</li>
<li>Thoughtfully designed interior that's easy to put together.</li>
<li>Uses standard-shaped motherboard, fan headers, power supply, and connectors, unlike lots of pre-built mini PCs.</li>
<li>Front tiles are fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power limits keep the 16-core CPU from running as fast as the socketed desktop version.</li>
<li>A $300-to-$400 dedicated GPU will still beat the Radeon RX 8060S.</li>
<li>Cheap-looking exterior plastic panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Soldered RAM in a desktop system.</li>
</ul>

            <p>
A mere seven days after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, Nintendo has given indies a turn, detailing exactly what Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> players can look forward to in between those bigger-budget releases. And while its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJXXKFrxT_U">latest Indie World Showcase</a> was certainly a brisk affair, it still managed to pack a lot in, so if you missed it live - or simply want a refresher - here's everything featured this time around. And to avoid an overwhelming sense of crushing disappointment, I'm just going to tell you now: there wasn't even a whiff of Silksong.

<h3>Mina: The Hollower</h3>

<p>
But as starters go, Mina: The Hollower set a high bar. It's the latest game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club, and sees the titular mouse embarking on a retro-tinged quest to save a cursed island. Mina was actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-devs-reveal-new-project-mina-the-hollower">announced all the way back in 2022</a>, but it finally has a suitably spooky release date. It's heading to Switch eShop on 31st October and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">demo's out today</a>.

<p>
Coming from Crypt Custodian and Islets developer Kyle Thompson, Well Dweller is a "dark fairytale metroidvania" charting the adventures of a tiny bird named Glimmer. Armed with a matchstick, players must brave the kingdom's perils in order to save Glimmer's siblings from the queen - who's determined to make them part of her gown. This one's coming to Switch sometime next year.

<h3>Neverway</h3>

<p>
If you're an indie showcase connoisseur, you'll probably be more than familiar with Neverway by now. It's a "nightmarish life sim RPG" that follows protagonist Fiona as she quits her job, makes a fresh start on a farm and, in something of a departure for the genre, gets recruited as the immortal herald of a dead god. It's got all the usual stuff - fishing, farming, crafting, romancing, and so on - but unspeakable horrors are beginning to leak into this reality and it's up to Fiona to fight back using her sword, hookshot, and other abilities she'll gain as players start to bond with the townsfolk. Neverway still doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Switch next year.

<p>
Herdlings is the latest adventure from developer Okomotive, the studio behind the well-received Far: Lone Sails and its sequel Changing Tides. It sees players embarking on a "tale of beauty and companionship" as they shepherd a steadily growing herd of mysterious creatures across its striking vistas of mist-shrouded forests, forgotten valleys, snowy plateaus, and more. Amid all that traversal, there's promise of challenges and threats to overcome, alongside light puzzling, and it's coming to Switch's eShop on 21st August.

<p>
In Poti Poti Studio's "pleasant" logic puzzler Is This Seat Taken?, the goal is to satisfy the demands of a particularly fussy group of chair occupiers and establish a seating plan that'll keep everyone happy. You'll be re-arranging bottoms across a host of environments - from the bus to a banquet to the office to a picnic - and if that appeals, you won't have long to wait. Is This Seat Taken? is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/is-this-seat-taken-switch/">out today on Switch</a>.

<p>
Here's a quick one for you. Little Kitty, Big City - the feline-focused open-world adventure from Double Dagger Studio - is poised to bring its latest free update to Switch. There's talk of new story content, a new neighbourhood to explore, and new characters to meet. That's alongside new photo mode options, a new cat customisation feature, and more. There's no specific release date for all this on Switch yet, but it's due later this year.

<p>
Content Warning, the co-operative horror romp that become something of a surprise internet sensation when it launched for PC last year, is making its way to Switch - and there'll be a Switch 2 version too. The gist, if you're unfamiliar, is that you and three friends must descend into nightmarish depths and capture the horrors within on camera. At least one of you must survive long enough to escape so you can upload your footage to the fictional SpöökTube in a bid to rack up the views and become a viral sensation. It's a fun time and is coming to Nintendo's platforms next year.

What happens if you combine the classic arcade brick-breakers of yore with base-building, grimy fantasy, and roguelite survival? Ball x Pit, from developer Kenny Sun and publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>, is your answer. Inspired by the likes of Loop Hero and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, players battle their way though auto-scrolling levels, using brick-breaking-style ball attacks to smash their way through barbaric hordes of oncoming enemies and massive bosses. Completing levels earns resources used to expand a settlement which in turn unlocks new bonuses characters, new power-ups, and more. Ball x Pit launches for the original Switch on 15th October, with the Switch version due this "autumn".

<p>
Ultimate Sheep Racoon is a game of tumbling, side-scrolling, bike-riding action, where up to eight players can work together - either locally or online - to create perilous obstacle courses and then battle for chaotic supremacy. If the name sounds familiar, that's because is the spiritual successor to Clever Endeavour Games' Ultimate Chicken Horse, and it's coming to Switch and Switch 2 - complete with cross-platform play support - this "winter".

65 million years have passed and the world has frozen over, sealing the oceans beneath a thick layer of ice. That's the starting point for Glaciered, a "chill" underwater action game from Studio Snowblind said to be inspired by the rich ecosystems and cold climates of Hokkaido, Japan. Playing as a Tuai, an avian species evolved from dinosaurs that can control heat and cold, players are tasked with traversing the diverse underwater world in order to fend off the creatures threatening the Everwinter. Appropriately enough, Glaciered comes to Switch 2 this "winter" and is a timed console exclusive.

And that's mostly it. However, in typical Nintendo fashion, the company squeaked in some blink-and-you'll-miss-it exciting reveals in one final lightning-fast montage. Alongside appearances from the likes of Winter Burrow, Undusted: Letters from the Past, Tiny Bookshop, Strange Antiquities, Opus: Prism Peak, and Go-Go Town, we also got word that developer Freehold Games' superb retro roguelike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/caves-of-qud">Caves of Qud</a> - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/caves-of-qud-review">earned itself a five star Eurogamer review</a> last year - is also heading to Switch, alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ufo-50-review-a-rangy-confounding-and-audacious-proposition">equally wonderful UFO 50</a>. The latter, essentially a collection of 50 new games designed to look like very old games from the team behind Spelunky - is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ufo-50-switch/">surprise-launching onto Switch today</a>!

<p>If you've played Ultimate Chicken Horse before, then you'll know just how brilliant it is when you're able to play with a handful of friends. Well, now developer Clever Endeavour Games is back with a sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ultimate_sheep_raccoon">Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</a>.</p>
<p>Better yet, it's launching on Switch and Switch 2 this <strong>Winter</strong>!</p>
<p>Like the original, Ultimate Sheep Raccoon has you race across courses in which you place obstacles to make life much harder for your opponents. The twist, however, is that they also affect <em>you</em>. So you need to make sure you're making the course as difficult as possible while also ensuring it's still actually doable. Kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a>!</p>
<p>This time, you'll be racing along on bikes, so you'll have the opportunity to pull off some sick tricks while avoiding buzzsaws, hammers, electric fences, and what have you. Cross-platform play is also supported, with up to 8 players able to take part in each race.</p>

<p><em>What do you make of Ultimate Sheep Raccoon? Will you be picking it up? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/">Honor of Kings: World</a> is a new spin on the widely successful mobile MOBA, Honor of Kings, which is consistently one of the most played games across the entire planet. World brings the mobile series directly to PC alongside its mobile version, and players will get their first chance to try it out at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>TiMi Studio has announced that it will be at Gamescom later this month with a demo of Honor of Kings: World in hand, and if you'll be at Gamescom in just a couple of weeks from the time of this writing, then make sure to head over to Hall 9, Booth B040 to check out the PvP and PvE gameplay that'll be featured in World.</p>



<p>Unlike the original Honor of Kings game, World is not a MOBA, but a multiplayer adventure RPG, and plays significantly differently from the mobile MOBA. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>While this is the first time the general public will get the chance to try out Honor of Kings: World, Wccftech and other members of the press got the chance to try it out earlier this year at GDC. Even though it was just a small slice of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto and Alessio Palumbo still walked away impressed</a> from what they played and saw.</p>



<p>"<em>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/long-delayed-rpg-demonschool-finally-gets-september-release-date.1264602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Necrosoft and publisher Ysbryd have announced that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, the long-delayed tactical RPG about balancing demon-hunting and university life, is coming this September.</p>

<p>This news was announced during today's Nintendo Indie World show, but for some reason, the announcement was left out of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">the Western presentation</a>; instead, it was revealed during the Japanese show. Strange, but that's life.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the first time we've had a promise that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date" rel="nofollow">would be launching in September</a>&nbsp;(albeit not this September), but hopefully, the game won't be delayed again and Necrosoft can finally release it. This certainly feels like a full stop rather than a tentative comma.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonschool-release-date-2025-combat.jpg?itok=0nzmYzpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonschool-release-date-2025-combat.jpg?itok=P3-fniAb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally bringing its demon-hunting, school-attending RPG goodness this September.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, it's a tactical RPG that was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">all the way back in June 2022</a>. Inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, as well as Italian horror movies, the game essentially marries the tactical combat of&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach&nbsp;</em>with the life-sim elements of Atlus' celebrated RPG series.</p>

<p>You play as Faye, the last in a long line of demon-hunters. She "loves to punch up", but she's not just about violence; she's also a caring person, as you'll learn through her relationships with her companions.</p>

<p>Necrosoft is promising a "light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty" in&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>; you'll be able to build relationships with each of the game's 15 characters, and doing so will also help you to strengthen your party for combat.</p>

<p>That combat takes the form of a turn-based tactical system in which you can strategically rewind in order to create combos and outfox your opponents. You can also use your environment contextually for extra bonuses.</p>




<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will finally be launching across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 3rd (assuming it doesn't get delayed again, at any rate). Stay tuned for more.</p>

I am neither a wrestler nor a wrestling fan. I have never attended a cage fight or hit somebody with a folding chair. I have never had a blowoff or no-sold somebody's attempt to lay the smackdown on my randy ass. I <em>cannot</em> smell what the Rock is cooking. I cannot. Nonetheless, I think a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>-style roguelite built around grappling sounds like a fun time, especially when it's set in a cursed Byzantine citadel. This is Realm Of Fame from Black Cube Games. Can you smell what the trailer is cooking?

<p>
"In this mystical roguelike, you play as Maj, a wandering soul driven by redemption and purpose," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310030/Realm_of_Fame/">the Steam page</a>. "Master grapples, throws, and counters in battles where every encounter with twisted spirits and mythic heroes feels like an ancient duel of strength, wit, and resolve."
</p>
<p>
The game's combat certainly appears to lean into the wrasslin' gimmick, though it's just as defined by magic. When you do a groundpound (is this a "smackdown"? Sources cannot confirm at the time of writing) on a burly wolfman, it may send energy waves shooting out in all directions. Expect an "ever-shifting labyrinth of storms and enchanted valleys", too, with boss fights in which you go up against corrupted classical celebs such as Hercules. If it were Achilles, we could make a joke about turning heel.
</p>
<p>
Maj's unlockable moves have names like "falcon dive", "slumber serenade" and "bubble suspension", all of which sound far too lyrical for WWE. As for where he gets his sorcerous buffness, it comes from "a mystical force called the Lover's Wind". Unfortunately, on acquiring the Lover's Wind, Maj accidentally unleashed a countervailing Evil Wind, which is the source of the world's corruption. Is <em>this</em> what the Rock was cooking? I think the Rock needs to lay off the sprouts for a while.
</p>
<p>I realise I'm leaning on the WWE gags here, but lobbing dudes around like sacks of potatoes is a pastime that stretches far beyond WWE. Amongst other things, I've just learned that "wrassling" is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_wrestling">Cornish profession</a>. Are there any other athletic precedents and traditions I should be invoking here? The developers are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916140/The_Tale_of_Bistun/">The Tale Of Bistun</a>, which is based on an epic Persian romantic poem from the 12th century, "Khosrow and Shirin".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zangief-basically-gets-his-own-game-in-hades-style-wrestling-roguelike-realm-of-fame]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting today, Xbox Insiders who have enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview will find Gaming Copilot (beta) in the Game Bar for Windows PCs. </p>



<p>Gaming Copilot is a feature that helps players reach gameplay faster, sharpens their skills, and guides them through obstacles. The early beta version was previously available through the Xbox Mobile app, enabling players to access Copilot on a second screen. Now, select players have received an even more integrated experience. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-gaming-copilot-beta-features">Xbox Gaming Copilot Beta Features</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gaming Copilot beta will track the player’s Xbox activity “to provide an experience centred around you”. Players can ask for help with the game they are playing, or with games they are interested in or want to discover. Additionally, you can also ask questions about your account, play history and achievements. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot widgets can be pinned to the screen and used through Voice mode. This mode allows players to use the feature while actively playing the game. Players can ask for tips or any other help without stopping the gameplay. All they need to do is select the ‘Microphone’ option in the Gaming Copilot widget, and the conversation can be continued seamlessly whenever the player is stuck. </p>



<p>Moreover, when the Xbox Insider asks Gaming Copilot for help during voice mode, it will take screenshots of the player’s gameplay to provide more helpful responses. This allows players to refer to events in the game as they occur, without needing a detailed description. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot (beta) is also available on Windows Handhelds for Xbox Insiders, albeit with limited functionality. The early preview is currently available only to Insiders in select regions. You can check out the complete list <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>

Explore a variety of genres, from <a title="Genres > Platformer [723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>s and <a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">shoot ’em up</a>s to puzzle games, <a title="Genres > Roguelite [269 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelites</a>, and <a title="Genres > RPG [17,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.</p><ul><li><strong>50 Brand New Games</strong> – These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience with its own title screen, intro, and ending. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,736 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> that could take many hours to beat.</li><li><strong>An Alternate Universe</strong> – According to the story of <em>UFO 50</em>, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity.</li><li><strong>An Instant Library</strong> – All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend’s house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim – exploring the collection is part of the fun!</li><li><strong>Authentic But Also Modern</strong> – We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that <em>UFO 50</em> was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.</li><li><strong>Versus and Cooperative Play</strong> – Roughly a third of the collection features local multiplayer, including <a title="Genres > Co-Op [310 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or <a title="Genres > Strategy [271 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy game</a>… or team up to beat a classic <a title="Genres > Arcade [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a> from an alternate timeline. It’s great for groups!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here are some of games you’ll get to play in <em>UFO 50</em>:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Campanella 2</em></strong>&nbsp;– The sequel to Campanella (another game in <em>UFO 50</em>), <em>Campanella 2</em> features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn’t always been a hero – by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past.</li><li><strong><em>Quibble Race</em></strong> – In this unique sci-fi “horse-<a title="Genres > Racing [265 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>” game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is… how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to three players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing.</li><li><strong><em>Pingolf</em></strong> – A fan favorite at PAX, <em>Pingolf</em> is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on!</li><li><strong><em>Seaside Drive</em></strong> – Sometimes you’ll want a break from long, <a title="Genres > Open-World [689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world games</a> and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style <a title="Genres > Action [2,912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> like <em>Seaside Drive</em>? But even in a popular genre, <em>UFO 50</em> brings something new to the table—in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of <em>Downwell</em>) designed a stylish car-based shoot ’em up where “drifting” across the screen is how you power-up your gun.</li><li><strong><em>Grimstone</em></strong> – Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! <em>Grimstone</em> follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you’ll be looking for answers as to why it happened.</li></ul><p>And that’s just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! There’s something for everyone!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ufo-50-now-available-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony's live-service video game releases haven't all succeeded like Helldivers 2 did, with Concord being a particularly high-profile failure. Sony CFO Lin Tao said during the company's earnings briefing this week that "it's not entirely going smoothly" as it relates to live-service games. But Tao pointed out that Sony has come a long way in the past half-decade.</p><p>"If you look five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios," Tao said, <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by This Week In Video Games.</a> "In terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-love-the-game-that-guardians-of-the-galaxy-almost-is.1264557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The past few months have been rocky for my mental health, so I’ve come back to a reliable source of joy: fixating on a specific piece of media until it is my entire personality. My weapon of choice at the moment is <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. I have read mountains of comics, re-watched all the movies, and bought a fan-made T-shirt. The only thing left for me to do was play the much maligned Eidos Montreal <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> video game. I really enjoyed it, which surprised me. But what I found most interesting about it was the ways the game is straining against the limitations of when it was made.</p><p>Despite strong reviews, 2021’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is often credited with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enixs-embracer-sale-300-million-sale-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting</a> Square Enix to sell Eidos Montreal to Embracer Group after the game’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/square-enix-claims-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-has-undershot-sales-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales failed to meet Square’s expectations</a>. It’s a shame that this is the game’s legacy, because well, it’s fun. I was a hater about the dialogue when the game released; I was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-joss-whedon-was-our-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neck deep in Joss Whedon collected works</a>, and they do actually say “that happened!” in this game. But the more I waded into <em>Guardians </em>recently, the more I appreciated the craft at work in its dialogue.</p><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> lore is incredibly convoluted, especially because the Guardians are perhaps the biggest victims of Marvel wanting to synergize the comics with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first modern appearance of Peter Quill, Starlord, is in a 2004 <em>Thanos</em> comic, written by Keith Giffen and illustrated by Ron Lim (the character originated in 1976 as a generic space hero, but these appearances have been removed from continuity—or maybe not? It’s hard to tell.). In this appearance, Quill has cybernetics in his face and has been imprisoned in the galactic prison The Kyln for collateral damage to the tune of 350,000 people while trying to save a planet from a cosmic threat. Over time, he manages to escape prison, put together the Guardians of the Galaxy, die, then get better. When James Gunn was asked to adapt this character for a movie, a lot of this background was changed, and thus, Quill’s depiction in the comics also changed to match the movies. Gone was the grizzled war veteran, replaced instead with a snarky outlaw.</p><figure><figcaption>My blorbos from my show | <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>I mention this because I remember complaining with my friends that the Peter Quill who appears in this game felt too similar to his depiction in Gunn’s movies. The truth is, Peter Quill is written differently basically every time he appears. What the Eidos Montreal game does is take the best parts of all the lore of the characters and mix ‘em together into a big stew. It mostly works, but it does make one wonder who the audience for this game actually is.</p><p>Peter Quill, like the movies, is still kidnapped the day his mother dies—but she dies from being shot by aliens, not cancer. He’s still desperately grasping onto the Earth culture he remembers, but it’s hair metal and 80s pop songs instead of James Gunn’s Gen Xer classic rock. Gamora is still the deadliest woman in the galaxy and Thanos’ daughter, but like the comics, she doesn’t have a romantic relationship with Quill. Drax is overly literal, but he’s on a revenge quest to kill Thanos, not Ronan the Accuser. Rocket Raccoon still has a Brooklyn accent, but he’s from Halfworld this time. Groot is pretty much the same, and he’s my friend.</p><p>This game was released at a time when the MCU was like a parasitic entity in every facet of popular culture. This was the era of <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>The Eternals</em> and <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, media so mediocre and so successful that I wound myself up into a frenzy trying to explain to people on the internet why I didn’t like them. I can understand why <em>Guardians</em> was a hard sell in this ecosystem. It’s not enough like the movies to appeal to fans, and not dissimilar enough from the movies to appeal to non-fans. Yet in playing it, I can feel it striving to be its own thing: a very playable, charming action game that makes you feel like you’re hanging out with The Guys. The Guardians of the Galaxy here are less like a band of outlaws and more like a musical group that’s spent a little too long on the road with each other. It really gives “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IM472k0Md8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will</a>.”</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>People who are irritated with each other will often come off as irritating to others. In the early portions of the game, listening to everyone argue is a struggle. But the arc here is obvious—as time goes on, everyone opens up to each other, and the way they riff as they grow closer is often very funny. In a middle game chapter, the Guardians are tasked by Cosmo, a psychic dog, to explore a destroyed space station. Drax, taking this task very literally, narrates out loud “dog report items” to send to Cosmo. <em>Everyone</em> in the group hates this incessant narration, but by the end of the mission Rocket has started pointing out extremely obvious dangers as “dog report items” because he knows it’ll make everyone groan. Reader: that is something I would absolutely do in real life. And I would do it because it has the same effect in this game as it does in real life. It takes the edge off of the hostility towards another person. It creates comradery. Eventually, it becomes funny.</p><p>I think when people talk about “good writing” in video games, they often mean “writing that is dark.” I appreciate the dedication to realism in dialogue here much more than twists and turns or melodrama. It becomes easier to see what audience Eidos Montreal was aiming for when you think about it in this way. They wanted the kinds of people who watch CW shows and like action movies, who might not be into the MCU but like 80s music and aren’t above the occasional pop culture reference. They want players like Peter Quill: people who grew up listening to metal songs about alien invaders, reading fantasy novels, and who have enough real life responsibilities that a twenty hour game is maybe the only thing they have time for. A general, non-gamer audience.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s there that the game becomes a little fraught for me, because the gameplay is what is straining against these parameters.The gameplay doesn’t suck, exactly, but while playing it I could really feel the economy of assets and mechanics. For instance, at least once a chapter, you go down a big slide. Every environment, from an alien planet to a Nova Corps battle ship, has a big ol’ slide. Once Quill gets the ice mode for his element guns, you’re constantly freezing over pipes that leak out poison gas. Enemy variety is basically non-existent. And while I disagree with the reviews at the time that said you’re not incentivized to use your fellow Guardians’ combat skills—fights feel so snappy and kinetic when you’re bouncing off your allies—I do agree that battles feel grindy, and that most bosses are just bullet sponges.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>What’s most frustrating are that mechanics that are fun to play with feel like the studio just… ran out of money or time to see them through to their fullest expression. Throughout the game you’re given choices to make as Peter Quill, leader of the Guardians, and each choice does have a real impact on what happens in the story. Early on you’re given the chance to either hide illegal tech or a space llama from the Nova Corps. If you choose to hide the llama, you’ll miss out on advanced weaponry for your ship, but the llama will be able to help you escape your room when you get trapped inside it later on. Some choices happen in the heat of battle—in one scene, Gamora ran off to chase after the game’s big villain, and my Peter followed her. Not only does this make her furious with you for the rest of the chapter, it makes the boss fight way harder. All of this is great, especially because it leans on the best aspect of the game: its characters and dialogue. But it just doesn’t happen enough.</p><p>Given the privilege of time, I can understand why <em>Guardians</em> is like this. In some ways it reminds me of the smoothed edges of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, a game that was seeking to bring in a new audience to its longrunning fiddly RPG epic. In order to appeal to non-gamers, it made its gameplay systems less complex, gave you less interaction with its characters, simplified everything lest it make potential players confused or intimidated. No one really liked this—not me, a longtime player of <em>Dragon Age</em>, and not non-gamers, who I imagine felt condescended to in the same way I did.&nbsp;</p><p>In a post-<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> world, it’s clear that more is more. Non-gamers don’t care if a game is extremely complex or fiddly. They <em>like</em> that. They like trying things and discovering what they can do. They like optional, and missable, conversations with companions. They like dying by accident, trying and failing, crowdsourcing knowledge to learn the best ways to get through combat. They like it so much that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baldur’s Gate </em>sold 15 million copies</a>.</p><p>Can you imagine a world where <em>Guardians</em> could have taken cues from <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>’s success? Where it could have had <em>more</em> systems, a more reactive environment for the element guns, more choices, more dialogue, where the infamously horny Peter Quill could have had a romance system? Where we weren’t all so fatigued by the MCU that the idea of willingly playing an MCU game didn’t feel utterly exhausting?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

<p>After a few lengthy delays, the tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> has finally secured a final release date for the Switch, and you've not got long to wait. As announced during the Indie World Japan showcase, the Necrosoft Games-developed title will launch on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The game is influenced by the likes of <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong>, along with – and this is brilliant – italian horror cinema..? <em>Excuse</em> me?! So cool. Plenty of footage has already been made available through trailers and gameplay showcases, so if you haven't checked out Demonschool yet, then definitely take a peek when you can. It looks awesome.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's nice to finally get a proper release date, and it sounds like Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield is equally relieved, stating "“At long last, Demonschool is finally coming out. It's been a long road but we're through certification and ready to go. We really put a lot of ourselves into this thing and now the future of Demonschool is in your hands. We truly hope you will enjoy it."</p>
<p>We hope so too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kitfox Games and Freehold Games have announced that <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a></strong> is finally on its way to Switch via a Q4 2025 release. That's not even very far away!</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of the game before, Caves of Qud is a game that spent a whopping 15 years in development and early access on PC, before releasing on that platform in December of last year to some outrageously gushing reviews.</p>
<p>We're looking at a retro-styled roguelike that's apparently got all of the goods here. Enough to make it a standout in one of the most oversaturated genres of all time, even. Wow. It certainly looks unique, with some fairly busy visuals that meld retro gaming chic with what looks like root directories from your dad's old PC. The good stuff, in short. You can also tell by the barmy text on-screen, and tons of lore at every turn, that there's a depth to the world you'll blast through.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer above, and we'll leave you with some further details about the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</p>
<p><strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</p>
<p><strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</p>
<p><strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</p>
<p><strong>Play one of four modes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC</strong> — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.<br>
<strong>ROLEPLAY</strong> — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.<br>
<strong>WANDER</strong> — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.<br>
<strong>DAILY</strong> — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</p>
</blockquote>
