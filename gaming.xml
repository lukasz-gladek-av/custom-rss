              <p>During the first day of Xbox’s big <em>Halo</em> esports event, a previously rumored remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>leaked ahead of a reported announcement.</p> <p>Here’s the remake’s first trailer, which leaked on October 24.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's the first look at Halo: Combat Evolved remake. <a href="https://t.co/XH1aaokxjH">pic.twitter.com/XH1aaokxjH</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1981817636229918970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And here’s the game’s description via an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">Xbox Store listing</a>, which seems to have gone live early:</p> <blockquote><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign. Experience the original story rebuilt with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics, and refined controls, plus three brand-new prequel missions featuring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson.

Despite positive reviews, the open-world spin on <em>Halo</em> failed to achieve the long-term success that Xbox had hoped for. Two years later, the studio suffered layoffs in 2023 and was then completely rebranded in 2024. The studio has also ditched<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s custom-made engine, Slipstream, and is now using Unreal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Set in Japan in the 1960s, <i>Silent Hill f</i> is notable for being the first full <i>Silent Hill</i> game set outside of America, far from the series’ titular troubled town. Hinako, the protagonist, is one of four teenagers whose lives get turned upside down by terrifying supernatural events that also double as an all too relatable metaphor for the rampant harms of misogyny and the way society devalues the lives of women. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__cnp_/">Actress Konatsu Kato</a> provides the voice of the character in Japanese, and also did the motion capture for her. She recently took to YouTube to stream the game for a little over an hour and a half (reaching Hinako’s arrival at the Dark Shrine). And hopefully she’s planning to stream more, because her reactions to the various freaky nonsense packed in <i>Silent Hill f</i> are priceless.</p> <h2>‘How could someone come up with something like this?’</h2> <p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ek5c3sQygs&amp;t=1507s">whole stream here</a>, but there are some standout moments worth jumping to if you’re a bit impatient.</p> <p>Here’s Kato encountering one of the game’s first fightable monsters, to which she says (based on auto-translate), “How could someone come up with something like this?:</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0Ek5c3sQygs?t=1492">Another great moment</a> comes early on when Kato has to run from the fog monster, which she does while screaming “Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.” If you don’t have time to watch the whole stream, it’s also worth jumping into about 55 minutes or so when she comes across the bloody mask with the key lodged inside. The monster chase that follows is good fun too, as Kato frantically tries to find out how to escape while saying “I can’t take it anymore! Eh, wait a minute. This way? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, which way, which way? Ah, I’ve done something weird.” And yes, like many of us likely did during this part, she totally goes for the wrong door.</p> <p>The video is titled “<i>SILENT HILL f </i>#1” so here’s hoping we get to see more!</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-after-hyping-games-business-to-investors-netflix-closes-squid-game-unleashed-studio.1334422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> developer Boss Fight Entertainment, according to former staff. News spread about the closure on Thursday, just days after <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix's third quarter financial earnings call</a> on Tuesday. Boss Fight was acquired by Netflix in 2022.</p><p>"Well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure," co-founder and studio director David Rippy wrote in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>. "Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including<em> Squid Game: Unleashed</em> which hit #1 in 26 countries." David Luehamm, Netflix game development director, suggested in his own Boss Fight goodbye post on LinkedIn that the studio had been working on something new: "I wish you could see what we had cooking," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davelueh_after-10-great-years-working-at-boss-fight-activity-7387207936252502016-2UYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was founded in 2013 and has largely focused on mobile games. Its first game under Netflix was <em>Dungeon Boss: Respawned</em>, followed by <em>Netflix Stories</em>, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-stories-mobile-games-shuts-down-1236350580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were visual novels based off Netflix shows</a>; <em>Money Heist: Ultimate Choice, </em>another visual novel based off a Netflix show; and <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a>, a battle royale game based the hit Netflix show that was released in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix did not provide a reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was the third independent game studio acquired by Netflix as it ramped up its ever-changing games strategy, following <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and mobile developer Next Games. Netflix bolstered its games strategy in 2022 by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening two studios in Finland</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and California</a>, respectively, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/netflix-acquires-6th-gaming-studio-spry-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then buying <em>Cozy Groze</em> maker Spry Fox</a>. Netflix closed the California studio in 2024; according to Game File, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was working on a triple A game</a>. Around that time, Netflix shook up its games program's leadership, shifting roles to land with former <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/netflix-games-president-alain-tascan-epic-1236081464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games executive vice president Alain Tascan</a> taking the helm as President of Games.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix has spent the past several years hyping up the sorts of games Boss Fight had been making—specifically, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>. In an <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> days before Boss Fight's closure, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters used <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> as an example of its strategy for one of its several "verticals," which is centered on "immersive narrative games based on our own IP." The other verticals are games for kids, social games that play on the TV (like <em>Boggle Party</em> or <em>Pictionary</em>), and mainstream game ports like <em>Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is Netflix's most downloaded game, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sensor Tower data reported by Reuters</a>.</p><p>"We're just starting to scratch the surface today," Peters said in the Tuesday earnings call. "We think there's much more we can ultimately do in this space. Yet we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the story but it creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the noninteractive side. It drives engagement, drives retention, and therefore, supports the business. So looking ahead, we're going to ramp our investment in this area judiciously based on demonstrating that we're ramping returns to the business, but we're extremely excited about the progress we've got ahead of us."</p><p>The strategy espoused Tuesday is the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Tascan told The Verge in March</a>. But Boss Fight's shuttering doesn't necessarily make sense within the scope of Netflix's plan: It seemed to be doing exactly what Netflix said—and says—it wants. The game is available on mobile to everyone, even people who aren’t Netflix subscribers, which could serve as a kind of promotion for the streamer’s exclusive content. It certainly “extends the audience's engagement with the story” of Netflix’s hit show, casting players as competitors in <em>Squid Game</em>’s fight to the death. By Netflix's count, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> reached number one in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free action game category in more than 100 countries on the App Store</a> charts. AppMagic estimated in early 2025 that <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflixs-squid-game-unleashed-mobile-game-surpasses-10m-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> was downloaded more than 10 million times</a>, making it the fifth most popular Netflix game. <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>, <em>Storyteller</em>, <em>SpongeBob: Get Cooking</em>, and <em>Bloons TD</em> fill out the top four, but <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>is the only one of these five games developed in-house by Netflix.</p><p>Peters spoke about Netflix's gaming business at the Bloomberg Screentime event in Los Angeles in October, likening the slow growth of that part of the business to Netflix's expansion into the Japanese market where, by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>' reporting, "only 2% of consumers knew the brand."</p><p>"We just did the 10th Anniversary in Japan ... but it took us a long time," Peters said at the event, as reported by Reuters. "The gaming situation is not dissimilar to that."&nbsp;</p><p>But people don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, it sounds like the social games played within the Netflix app, on TV screens, is what's stepping forward; Peters said that this holiday season Netflix is releasing a bunch of party games that play on the TV—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/797589/netflix-tv-party-games-boggle-tetris-lego-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boggle Party, Pictionary Game Night, LEGO Party, Tetris</em></a>—but are controlled by phones. That does make more sense than other games; people are already in the Netflix app, and games that are easy to get into and play are ultimately what users will see. But it doesn't solve the problem that most people, when opening Netflix, are looking for something to watch rather than play.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix's failure to become a meaningful platform for games isn’t the fault of anyone at the studio level. And whether or not <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> succeeded by whatever metric the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously fickle company</a> set for it, there’s no denying it fits within Netflix’s strategy around the show, which has seen multiple spinoffs and tie-ins. But Netflix clearly doesn’t know precisely what it wants games to do on its platform, a problem well above the remit of the developers at Boss Fight who’ve lost their jobs. As usual, when executives flounder, it’s workers who pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week, another baffling headline out of Microsoft. The latest is at least illustrative: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, the company has set an across-the-board goal of 30 percent “accountability margins” – Microsoft’s weird, somehow-worse-sounding term for profit margins – which explains why its gaming division has been rampantly laying off employees, canceling games, and closing studios. So now we know the directive that informed numerous questionable decisions, but why keep doing it? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we wonder if Microsoft will ever find a way to right the ship.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the aforementioned recent revelation that Microsoft has been seeking a 30 percent profit margin from its gaming division since 2023. This borders on ludicrous compared to what the rest of the industry typically achieves and fully clears that bar in the case of Xbox, which managed a 12 percent profit margin in 2022. Now here we are in 2025, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/were-still-feeling-aftershocks-from-microsofts-destructive-july-layoffs-and-cancellations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project cancellations</a>, because while Xbox was profitable, it wasn’t profitable <em>enough</em>. We once again repeat what has become a common refrain: What is Microsoft thinking, especially as both the industry and the global economy enter increasingly uncertain times? And if Microsoft continues to pump out pricey hardware while laying off developers and shutting down studios, where will the money come from?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about TwitchCon and the security woes that became <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the story of this year’s event</a>. While the claim that TwitchCon had no security is definitively untrue, misogyny and sociopathic clip farming intrinsic to the modern platform ecosystem still managed to spill over into real life. How does Twitch handle that? At what point does TwitchCon become so much of a reputational risk that Twitch would be better off pulling the plug?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we talk about both Mario (the video game character) and Luigi (Mangione).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/holy-crap-it-looks-like-disney-is-finally-restoring-and-releasing-the-original-version-of-star-wars.1334407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The theatrical version of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope,</em> released as just <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em></a> back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of<em> Star Wars</em>. Then, recently, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ysOeFio">video clips surfaced</a> of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of <em>Star Wars</em>. Those clips were promptly deleted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1o52vaa/star_wars_theatrical_ot_leaked_restoration/">but leaked screenshots are still floating around</a> and show new, highly detailed scans of <em>A New Hope</em>, and also <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and<em> Return of the Jedi,</em> implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ctHBnCF">using original film negatives</a> and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

 <p>This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Original_unaltered_trilogy">was way back in 2006</a>. The DVD versions of<em> Star Wars</em> released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the S<em>tar Wars</em> movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.</p>

 <p>And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of<em> Star Wars</em> via projects like <a href="https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/"><em>4K77</em>,</a> these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.</p>

 <p>We already know that Disney plans to bring back <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release"><em>A New Hope</em> to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise</a>. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.</p> <p><em>Star Wars</em> is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No Guts, no glory.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Board games and anime are living in a bit of a golden era right now, where both are more popular and widely accepted by the masses than ever before. I count myself lucky that I am living in a period of time where I also get to see these two awesome things blend and combine together, in equally – almost Voltron-esque – awesome new ways. One of the most exciting recent examples of this collaboration is Monolith Board Game’s upcoming <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/monolith-board-games-sarl/berserk-the-board-game#/section/project-story/the-world-of-berserk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Berserk: The Board Game</u></a>, which has taken off on Gamefound this month.</p><div catalogid="8af5b904-5b67-4bf6-9aeb-546b99842755" id="229882"><div id="229882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Berserk: The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Here's where to back the project.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly 5,900 backers and pulling in just over €2 million at time of writing, this tabletop adaptation of Kentaro Miura’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/berserk-1997"><u>Berserk manga/anime</u></a> has cut through its funding goal like Guts cleaving through a demon with his signature Dragon Slayer. Berserk: The Board Game lets 1-5 players take up the weapons of characters, including Serpico, Farnese, Isidro, Shierke, and of course, Guts to dispatch and destroy demonic foes. All of Guts' crew come in detailed miniatures just begging to be painted. These plastic avatars of the Grunbeld and its Grunbeld Apostle, Slan, and Makara are sights to behold, and more than 120 miniatures is a treasure trove for fans that enjoy painting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Berserk manga will be treated to a ton of artwork pulled from the original story to enjoy. All of the action cards that compose each character’s deck feature iconic moments from the series, along with the imposing enemy cards and more. The core game box gives you an 11 Act campaign that takes place during the <a href="https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon_Arc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Millennium Falcon arc</u></a>, but the additional Black Swordsman expansion that is also available during the campaign allows you to build your own adventures with tons of possible combinations and options to pick from – including the characters in your party and the enemies you are going to face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While board game adaptations, especially these grandiose boxes, aren’t uncommon these days, most of the time it seems as though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games are the source material</a>, and seeing an anime with such legacy and personality as Berserk is exciting. Monolith Board Games has a pedigree for adapting properties for the tabletop that let players team up and bash some heads in, having previously designed games based on Conan the Barbarian and Batman. Berserk, with its mix of dice rolling, card draw, and grid-based movement, looks like it is going to be another gruesome good time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Backing the project</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserk: The Board Game looks to have set itself up as a box that will appeal to fans of Berserk who may not have much exposure to the board game scene, thanks to all of the miniatures, as well as fans of co-operative board games thanks to <a href="https://monolithedition.com/en/?srsltid=AfmBOorQlFhIOVq47gt-eRt-hFrVc3EpqJe88mEICIDa8qMmOtjkeh9m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monolith’s expertise</a>. If you want to make sure that Berserk is for you and your game group before backing it, there is a <a href="https://monolithedition.com/download/berserk_rulebook_kit-demo_en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WIP Rulebook</u></a> available to look at for a better sense of gameplay. This is undoubtedly a premium product with just the Core pledge running you €200 (about $233) with the total jumping to €335 (about $390) if you want it all, including the 184 miniatures. Gamefound does offer StretchPay that lets you pay off these large costs over multiple months. As someone who has taken advantage of this myself, it helps a ton! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign is going on for only a few more days, but late pledges will open soon after it closes for those to jump on if you miss the initial campaign.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More board game collaborations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

                <p>Earlier this week, Activision debuted a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> that sent Peter Stormare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-ops-7-trailer-makes-fun-of-the-jeff-bezos-celebrity-space-flight/1100-6535689/" data-ref-id="1100-6535689">The Replacer to outer space</a>, where he promptly doomed influencer/boxer Jake Paul out of negligence by launching him into the void. Now, Activision is keeping the joke alive by giving Paul his own star.</p><p>On the official Call of Duty social media accounts, Activision designated star JP-7 for Paul. However, the image used implies a Jake Paul constellation.</p><p>The original ad is a parody of the Blue Origin celebrity space misadventure, which led to wide-spread mockery for Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos' wife, Lauren Sanchez, after their low-orbit flight. Call of Duty's "celebrity" crew included Paul and Love Island's Huda Mustafa. It also introduced Terry Crews and Nikki Glaser as the new Replacers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbx5P6E7wyQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sbx5P6E7wyQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ahead of the game's release next month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/" data-ref-id="1100-6535666">Treyarch's latest Dev Talk video</a> debuted seven new multiplayer maps, three Zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p>Former Call of Duty boss Glen Schofield recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-call-of-duty-boss-immensely-worried-about-the-series-under-microsofts-ownership/1100-6535500/" data-ref-id="1100-6535500">his concerns about the future of the franchise</a>, and he contends that the games have gotten worse since his departure.

                <p>The Octopath Traveler series began with a funny name and a bold concept: eight individual stories converging in one connected world, all presented in a retro "HD-2D" aesthetic that paid homage to Square Enix's beloved 16-bit era. Octopath Traveler 2 expanded on the concept further, and this year, Octopath Traveler 0 is once again making the already-massive RPG even broader, using the core story of the mobile game Champions of the Continent and transforming it into a full-fledged Octopath prequel.</p><p>This time you'll create your own customized protagonist character, and the game has an ambitious town-building mechanic that both enhances your options and fleshes out quests to have more reward. Combat options are also greatly expanded now that you can have eight party members in battle at once--four in the frontline and four in the back for support. We've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/" data-ref-id="1100-6534403">impressed by what we've seen so far</a>, so we spoke with producer Hirohito Suzuki and game director Yasuhiro Kidera about some of our burning questions.</p><p>Octopath Traveler 0 is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2 on December 4.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590357"></a><figcaption>Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg"></figure><p><strong>What are the core aspects of an Octopath game that you wanted to retain in Octopath Traveler 0? Are we still focused on eight individual stories?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hirohito Suzuki (Producer): </strong>Personally, I'd say that "freedom" is the core of what I wanted to express with this game. Especially when it comes to the Octopath Traveler series, Path Actions are an important feature, and as you can tell from that, though there is a story that unfolds in the game, it's really the player’s choices that helps unfold a different kind of drama. And so, with this game, that was really the core concept that we wanted to center the game around as we designed it. It's essentially this idea that you’re starting from zero to create your own character through the character creation feature, and then similarly, starting from zero to rebuild and restore your town through the Town Building feature. We honed in on this idea to really expand this notion of player freedom.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the focus on eight individual stories, similarly as the title suggests with the word "Octopath," we did try to build a story that represents and captures this concept of eight. So, we do hope that that’s something that players look forward to and try to search too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Our gameplay demo showed some of the ways that the town-building aspect feeds into quests. How do you balance the overarching story with those kinds of moving parts at play?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> I really wanted to be able to make the Town Building feature something that helps to enrich the journey itself. And vice versa, as you're going on the journey and progressing through it, it helps to make your town that much more enriched too.</p><p dir="ltr">More specifically, when it comes to Town Building, the more you progress and invest time into that feature, you start to unlock other features like cooking, and you're able to build shops, fields and farms as well. All of these things help to make your journey itself more convenient, more accessible, and that much richer. It helps to provide a lot of different features that enhance your overall journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Conversely, going on the journey also allows you to meet new people, interact with them and even invite them back to your town through Path Actions. Through your journey, you can also obtain new types of information, new types of recipes to cook, new skins, new products in your shop, and even information for the products that get sold in the shops as well. In that way, the time you spend on your journey also comes back to feed into enriching the town as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590360" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590360"></a><figcaption>Town building in Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What kinds of considerations or revisions did you need to keep in mind adapting this from the roots of Champions of the Continent?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> It is true that when it comes to how we approached development for this game, we did take the mobile experience and took the overall storyline that was present in there and brought it into the latest installment Octopath Traveler 0. Within Octopath Traveler 0, more than half of the content is new, so trying to make that happen was certainly a challenge on our end.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the overall new main story that’s been added, around 30% is new compared to the overall game experience that’s presented within Octopath Traveler 0. We did have a strong sense of confidence that the original story that unfolds in Champions of the Continent is a very good one. So, we really tried to make sure that we weren't changing that core experience but still doing what we can and striking a balance to still make this latest installment exciting as a new game, without really changing the things that we did create.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that we adjusted with this game is that we removed a lot of the gacha elements that were present in the mobile version of the experience. But we offset that through having over 30 new characters that appear, where you encounter them organically in many different formats through the story and the places that you visit throughout your journey. So that's something that we did keep in mind as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yasuhiro Kidera (Game Director):</strong> When it comes to level design and creating those levels themselves, we did start from zero. We threw out all of the data that existed for the mobile version of the game and started from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to our approach for combat, from the first Octopath Traveler to the mobile game, we did add changes to the concept of a turn-based battle. But then as we were thinking about what we could do to bring this mobile experience back to console, we wanted to be able to introduce new features as well. And so that's when the Action Skills came in, as well as the Ultimate Techniques. Through those, I really do think you're able to create an exciting experience that also touches on this concept of "freedom" for players as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590361"></a><figcaption>Character creation in Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does having a "create your own protagonist" aspect shift the usual Octopath storytelling and game structure?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> Regarding the overall shift that came with the approach of creating your own protagonist, because the players themselves become the protagonist, it was really important that we made it so that the story didn't feel like anyone else's story, but players' themselves. I think that was a big shift that we had to implement with this game.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the story or game mechanism changes that came from this, I do think in both facets, the player becomes the protagonist themselves. So, one thing that we did was, rather than trying to depict the protagonist solely--in terms of themselves or in context of themselves--we tried to depict all the other peripheral elements that are important to define the role that the protagonist plays. We really wanted to be able to depict themes of light versus dark, themes of good versus evil, as well as depict the world and the lore at large. That helps to create a silhouette of who that protagonist is supposed to be.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the story that revolves around the theme of restoration--this is about how at the very beginning of the game, the town that the player is residing in is destroyed. And then from there, the player must embark on a journey to restore it and rebuild their town. But they start to see that a lot of people who used to live in that town have been scattered throughout the world following this tragedy. So, it’s a process of interacting with them and inviting them back to live in the town again--to have the player build their very own town.</p><p dir="ltr">On the contrary, when it comes to the plot that surrounds the concept of revenge--the bosses who are the evil entities in this story, who stand against the world and who are also the people who destroyed the player's town at the very beginning of the story, they become brought into the picture and you have to go against them as well. By depicting all these other elements outside of the player themselves, I feel as though this was the biggest shift we made with this installment compared to past iterations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>During the demo we noticed we had several combat options available at any given time. How did you balance combat design while giving the player so much more flexibility?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kidera:</strong> One thing we thought very deeply about until the end of development was how do we ensure that everyone's favorite characters are very usable and viable from a combat perspective until the very end. That was something that we really thought about and was the reason why we implemented new features such as Action Skills which are a new feature in this game. But these sorts of adjustments were very challenging. Even through the course of development, we had to make balancing adjustments three times on different occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, when we conducted our first internal testing, our initial feedback was that combat was too easy. So, from there, we had to make enemies stronger, adjust abilities, etc. Each tester also did adopt very different combinations or formations when it came to formulating their party. So, making adjustments with that in mind was a very challenging thing to do as a developer, but also very fun to watch as well. I'm very excited to be able to see what kind of combinations and formations the players themselves come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been a decade-long journey so far, and it'll have been over a decade by the time its finished, but we're nearing the completion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. With Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 currently in development, we're on the lookout for any bit of information we can get, and in a recent <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">interview with VGC</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a little more insight into the game's development.</p>



<p>Recently, Hamaguchi spoke about how he's looking to provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">"<em>a new gaming experience</em>" </a>for players with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, by which he meant Part 3 will have a different kind of focus compared to its predecessors. He also commented that he believes the conclusion to this decade-plus trilogy journey <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">will satisfy old and new fans alike</a>, and with regard to when the game is coming, we heard from Tetsuya Nomura recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">that Part 3 is "<em>on schedule</em>."</a></p>



<p>In this interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">VGC</a>, Hamaguchi doubles down on how development for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing, saying, "<em>We're working really hard on the third game in the Remake series at the moment. It's coming along really</em> <em>well. I've got in my head the vision now, the gameplay structure, the gameplay experience, the core experience, and it's looking in a really good state.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It's something really satisfying that gamers can get their teeth into, and it'll be just a brilliant experience that it really should be and has to be. So we're going to work on that, brush that up even further, and then deliver it in the not-too-distant future. You really can look forward to the climax of the series, and it'll be exactly what you want it to be. So don't worry about that.</em> <em>It's coming, and it's just as good as you think it is. I'm very confident in the game that I'm making there.</em>"</p>



<p>Separately in the interview, Hamaguchi also commented about <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">Part 3 coming to Nintendo Switch 2, along with the rest of the trilogy</a>. He did his best to reassure players that they don't have to worry about how the games will run on Switch 2, saying they've done "<em>some Switch 2-specific optimizations and further tweaks</em>" to make sure that the games will perform well on Nintendo's new console.</p>



<p>All things considered, it's good to hear how confident Hamaguchi is about Part 3, and it's good to hear that we'll get to see more in "<em>the not-so-distant future</em>." With one last major event left for the rest of the year, we might even be close enough to find out the official name of Part 3 at The Game Awards later this year.</p>

              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p> <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>

<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Black Ops 7, bringing The Replacer back, with a twist. In this escapade, we learn how The Replacer is no longer The Replacer, and instead, he’s being… Replaced. We also see Jake Paul ejected into space, followed by a classic Wilhelm Scream that’s music to our ears.</p>



<p>This is serious, by the way. The trailer features the acting talents of Peter Stormare as always, but this time around, he’s being Replaced by none other than Terry Crews, who *checks notes* needs to pee.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is in <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-trailer-has-the-replacer-replaced">Black Ops 7 Trailer Has The Replacer Replaced</h2>



<p>The two-minute-and-some trailer uploaded on the Call of Duty social channels today might have you baulking at first glance, as it opens with none other than <strong>Jake Paul </strong>front and centre. However, thanks to the shrewd button-bashing skills of Peter ‘The Replacer’ Stormare, he’s quickly blasted from a spaceship and into the murky depths of the beyond.</p>



<p>At that point, The Replacer becomes confused as to who Jake Paul even <em>was</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Black Ops 7 trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As The Replacer realizes he has bitten off more than he can chew by Replacing a space captain, he finds himself adrift alongside ‘The First Baddie in Space’ and a baboon of some kind.</p>



<p>This is a serious trailer, by the way. </p>



<p>Fans have now expressed <strong>serious concerns </strong>that Jake Paul will be added to Black Ops 7 as an Operator. If you thought that blue skins were bad enough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/">in Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll have a whole new issue to deal with if that comes true.</p>



<p>Terry Crews, on the other hand…</p>

                <p>According to Shawn Layden, a live-service game "isn't really a game." The former PlayStation executive said in an interview that a live-service game is better described as a "repetitive action engagement device."</p><p>Then what <em>is </em>a game? Speaking to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, Layden said a game needs three elements. "I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world," he said. "And Horizon, God of War, and Uncharted have all three of those things," he said. "If you're doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and [the player's] desire to do it again and again and again."</p><p>Layden left Sony in 2019. He hasn't said exactly why he left, but explained in the interview that live-service was "not my skillset." At the time, Sony was investing heavily in live-service and was planning to release a dozen live-service games by 2026. Sony later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut that projection in half</a>, and some of the titles it has released, like Concord, failed spectacularly. Others, like Helldivers 2, have been enormously successful.</p><p>Researcher Joost van Dreunen told The Ringer that Sony's misses in the live-service department "sting, but they're not fatal." He said, "Even if live-service fizzles, the PS5 business is strong. The real risk isn't collapse--it's wasted time and money that could've gone into what Sony already does best."</p><p>Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">invested more than $1.45 billion into Fortnite developer Epic Games</a>, so the company likely stands to benefit as Fortnite continues to grow and grow. Sony is also continuing to invest in its own live-service projects, and the next big release is Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. The game has already had a rocky road to release, though, as it was delayed indefinitely and is caught up in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">art theft scandal.</a></p><p>For his part, Layden said companies should not look to live-service to help turn their businesses around. "If you're trying to go into that space because you have this illusion in your mind of big sacks of money coming every day for the rest of your life, for most it doesn't happen," he said.</p><p>In 2023, one of PlayStation's most important people, Connie Booth, left the company after 30+ years. She has never explained her departure, but former PlayStation developer David Scott Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, said<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJ8WO7ovDE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Booth was fired</a>.</p><p>"She was fired. She was not let go. She didn't retire. She didn't quit. She was fired," Jaffe said.</p><p>Jaffe went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-2024/1100-6518034/" data-ref-id="1100-6518034">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a> gave a mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles, which in turn reportedly upset a number of PlayStation developers. "All of this was somehow blamed on Connie," Jaffe said. "The blame has fallen on Connie."</p><p>One Sony live-service game that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/" data-ref-id="1100-6529585">not going forward is Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online</a>, which Neil Druckmann said was the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever.</a> A live-service God of War game was reportedly planned at one point as well before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">apparently getting canceled.</a></p><p>Another upcoming live-service game from Sony is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a>, but Sony has been quiet on the project of late, even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-live-service-game-fairgame-loses-another-key-developer/1100-6534409/" data-ref-id="1100-6534409">multiple senior staff have left, including the founder of its development studio.</a> Despite all of this, Sony has said time and time again that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-remains-committed-to-live-service-but-doesnt-mention-fairgame/1100-6534742/" data-ref-id="1100-6534742">remains committed to live-service</a> and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">learned from the mistakes of Concord.</a></p>

                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> being a Borderlands game, you'll inevitably come across a piece a gear that just won't shut up. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-2/" data-ref-id="5000-112742">Borderlands 2</a> had The Bane, a unique submachine gun that screamed incessantly; meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-3/" data-ref-id="5000-454301">Borderlands 3</a> had The Unkempt Harold, a legendary pistol that made illogically funny statements. Borderlands 4 is no different, with the legendary shield Cindershelly treating you like a sub to its dom. But, apparently, this armament wasn't supposed to bark smutty lines as often as Gearbox Software coded it to.</p><p>Borderlands 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-adds-halloween-event-and-more/1100-6535671/" data-ref-id="1100-6535671">October 23 update</a> made an assortment of changes while also adding a Halloween event to the looter-shooter. Buried within the lengthy patch notes, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/turns-out-that-horny-borderlands-4-shield-wasnt-actually-supposed-to-be-so-horny-or-at-least-not-so-horny-so-often-voice-lines-now-trigger-at-the-intended-frequency/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by PC Gamer</a>, was one curiously sly adjustment: Cindershelly's voice lines won't trigger as frequently, so that the shield will be less distracting. That doesn't sound like anything special, but when you consider how horny the shield was and how often it catcalled, you'd think that maybe you were getting hit on the entire time you ventured around the world of Kairos.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As PC Gamer noted, some of the voice lines were especially raunchy. Cindershelly would say things like "Touch that barrel and scream for me" and "Don't stop till I allow it." The legendary shield would then keep going, telling you to "Show me how close you can get, worm," and "Worship me." Apparently, it got worse in combat, as these lines would trigger when doing or taking damage, which happens all the time in a Borderlands game.</p><p>Cindershelly was built by the Order, a weapons manufacturer for The Timekeeper's army. The shield is a random loot drop, like most gear in Borderlands 4, but you have a greater chance of finding it from The Backhive in The Fadefields' Auger Mine in the Dissected Plateau. It's a solid piece of loot that grants you damage reduction and emits an AOE blast that deals damage once it breaks, based on your Resolve stacks. And now, it's gotten that much better because you'll likely get less turned on since it won't sexily insult you as much--if getting turned on by pixels is a thing you're into.</p><p>Cindershelly isn't the only horny piece of gear in the franchise. Borderlands 2 had the effervescent sniper Hot Mama that, like Borderlands 4's super-horny shield, spoke suggestive innuendos at you while gunning goons down. Welcome to the Goonerlands, everyone, I guess.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Nintendo Switch 2 port is in the works, but has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">pushed out of its October 3 release</a> to ensure it meets the quality Gearbox Software expects of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders%E2%80%99-impressive-accessibility-features-are-a-rarity-for-nintendo.1334320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805281/tmi-about-kirby">Nintendo Direct on October 23rd</a> brought us an hour-long dive into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/781177/kirby-air-riders-feels-more-like-f-zero-than-mario-kart"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, as well as a surprising accessibility announcement. Hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, the Direct showed off more features, gameplay, and modes for the racing game releasing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Tucked toward the end of the presentation, however, Sakurai devoted a few minutes to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility options. It was a welcome spotlight on an aspect of game design Nintendo regularly forgets, though not necessarily a sign of broader change for the company.</p><p>An impressive suite of options includes button remapping, changeable text size — something missing from many games, but vital on the Switch 2’s smaller undocked screen — colorblind filters, preset options for changing the size and opacity of the HUD, and a toggle for onscreen outlines (though this was the only menu option not demonstrated during the Direct). Unlike with previous first-party Switch 2 games, inputs can be remapped in-game as opposed to solely through the Switch 2’s system-level options. You can also save named profiles for quick switching and set up the controls so the game is playable one-handed.</p><p>After presenting this list, Sakurai focused in on something he wanted to implement “no matter what” — motion sickness mitigations. In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> you can add onscreen markers, ostensibly of varying thicknesses and colors, and change the field of view to reduce the perception of motion. Alternatively, you can turn camera shake and tilt off altogether, all of which can be visualized within the menu. For greater simplicity, there are also preset options for visual accessibility from “none” to “medium” and “strong.”</p><p>It’s a boon for players, especially disabled players — not just that these features are included but that they’re being communicated ahead of release. Accessibility menus beyond the bare-bones remain rare from Nintendo’s first-party titles, and it’s significant that a tentpole title from the Switch 2’s release year takes such a major step toward a more accessible and customizable experience. That said, we should temper our expectations of what this means going forward.</p><p>To be clear, this <em>should </em>be a precedent for Nintendo to follow — not just in the maintenance of these features in future titles, but also further accessibility development. But it should be noted that Sakurai has taken a greater personal interest in accessibility over the past few years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS4CZkBBbW4">particularly in the impact of motion sickness</a>. The evidence of the past six months suggests that the impetus behind <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility considerations likely comes from Sakurai and his team, rather than Nintendo as a whole.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis">system-level accessibility improvements in the Switch 2</a> were a similar cause for excitement that they might represent a meaningful change for Nintendo. Instead, the first-party games that followed released with few, if any, accessibility considerations. This culminated in <em>Drag x Drive</em>, where that apathy was more keenly felt in a game depicting wheelchair basketball and yet utilizing inaccessible mouse controls. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/758328/drag-x-drive-review">Nintendo’s suggested players seek mitigations in system-level menus</a>.</p></div><p>Similarly, previous ostensible precedents have proven otherwise. In 2020, <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>appeared to be a turning point for accessibility in gaming going forward. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2BX4yw8Z4Y">Sakurai praised <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>’s accessibility</a> and cited it as a title from which he learned a lot about accessibility not long before starting development on <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> — only for the broader industry to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">deprioritize accessibility in years since</a>.</p><p>None of which is to say we shouldn’t celebrate this surprising and sudden increase in accessibility in a first-party Nintendo release, nor that players shouldn’t be excited. Looking at the care Sakurai and his development team have taken to make <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>more accessible is a rare bright spot in this industry. It behooves us, however, to not get carried away in regarding this as a turning point at Nintendo given how strongly history suggests otherwise.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/806242/kirby-air-riders-accessibility-features-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. In it, we see intense combat, including two newly revealed characters, such as a talking Korok, joining the roster.</p>



<p>The Hyrule Warriors series has been going strong for more than 10 years, combining the beautiful world of Legend of Zelda and the hack-and-slash gameplay of Dynasty Warriors. The last release, Age of Calamity, adapted Breath of the Wild and told the story of the Guardians during the Great Calamity. Now, we get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. With its November 6th, 2025 release coming up, a new trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> shows off more of the game’s story and Musou gameplay, alongside some fresh faces.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYpLBmy7xMw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we get some new footage of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, including story and gameplay. We see the first Guardians battle it out with Ganon’s limitless forces, with King Rauru at the helm. As Zelda is transported there after being attacked by Ganon during the beginning of Tears of the Kingdom, she, like us, will be learning as we go. Still, some new faces have joined the fight, including a traveling talking Korok named Calamo and a transforming Zonai called the Mysterious Construct.</p>



<p>As it takes place during the battle between Rauru and Ganon, we see fresh faces not shown in Tears of the Kingdom. There is a lot of room for the narrative to go, so fans will be in for a big treat. Even still, Koei Tecmo, it’s developing team, have been on a roll recently with Dynasty Warriors: Origins and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. Seeing as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity was great, Age of Imprisonment looks to be just as good, if not better.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-skill-based-matchmaking-blops-7-sbmm-explained.1334311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Black Ops 7 SBMM conversation has dominated the lead-up to the game’s launch, so let’s see if Activision has finally pulled back on skill-based matchmaking.</p>



<p>If you’re in the gaming circle and you’ve never heard the term ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a>,’ you’re a lucky cat. The FPS community can’t go a week without bringing up SBMM. The more people learn about it, the more it becomes talked about, and the more mainstream it becomes, the more of an issue it becomes in shooters.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7 needing a big push to match <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> this year, a lack of SBMM could be the key.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sbmm-in-black-ops-7">Is SBMM In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breakthrough. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is finally doing away with skill-based matchmaking, as the default matchmaking system will no longer just take into account a player’s skill level when forming lobbies.</strong></p>



<p>There it is. The one thing the CoD community has been crying out for over the last few years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 will use ‘Open Matchmaking’</a> to create online multiplayer lobbies. On paper, this is going to be the most open and lottery-esque Call of Duty multiplayer title in years.</p>



<p>Here’s the official statement from Call of Duty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We can confirm that Open Matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer. Additionally, to help keep players together from match to match more often, persistent lobbies will be coming to Black Ops 7 at launch on November 14.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The persistent lobbies change is also a welcome addition for many. Activision is seemingly throwing two Hail Marys to win over players and ensure it reigns supreme in the FPS war for the next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-skill-based-matchmaking-do-in-call-of-duty">What Does Skill-Based Matchmaking Do In Call of Duty?</h2>



<p><strong>Skill-based matchmaking is an algorithm that uses player data to determine matchmaking factors ahead of everything else in Call of Duty and other leading multiplayer titles with SBMM.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s simplify this: In Black Ops 6, the lobbies you were put into were predominantly determined by how the game adjudged your individual skill level. Let’s say that your combined K/D and W/L for the last 10 matches have been decent, and the game has given you a skill rating of 1.25 (for argument’s sake), Black Ops 6’s matchmaking would then try to put you in a lobby with other players that also have a 1.25 skill rating—give or take a few points.</p>



<p>If you have several bad games in a row, your skill rating could drop, and then you’re suddenly put in with players who (on average) are much worse than you. This means you should be able to dominate the lobby and be the MVP. But doing so would catapult your skill rating again and put you back with players on your level.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has followed in XDefiant’s path by removing SBMM by default. This means you’ll spend the full year being put into lobbies with players of all skill levels, with an emphasis likely on regional proximity over player similarity.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Call of Duty community is unmatched, and we thank you for joining us in the Black Ops 7 Beta over the last week. This Beta has provided Treyarch the opportunity to try new things and rapidly test and implement player feedback. </p><p>Building on this feedback, we can confirm that… <a href="https://t.co/BKDWLCtoR2">pic.twitter.com/BKDWLCtoR2</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1976285658672136344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>You’ve all wanted it, so now you can’t complain this year! Black Ops 7 has officially gone rogue, and all bets are off where matchmaking is concerned. Are you one of the many who wanted SBMM to be removed?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159845/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine, if you will, an alternate timeline where 3D graphics never happened.</p>
<p>Instead, Sega's 'Super Scaler' concept — popularised in games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_super_hang-on">Hang-On</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> — evolves to the point where 2D sprites can not only be scaled without any degradation in visual fidelity, but are capable of filling the entire screen. That future is basically what you're looking at when you play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/night_striker_gear">Night Striker Gear</a>, a sequel to Taito's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">1989 coin-op</a>, which has been developed by M2 and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Am2-shottriggers">ShotTriggers</a> team.</p>
<p>Directed by the legendary Hiroshi Iuchi (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ikaruga">Ikaruga</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin &amp; Punishment</a>), Night Striker Gear is conceptually the same as its forerunner; you control the INTER-GRAY, a flying car which dashes through a series of levels destroying enemies and taking down bosses before selecting a branching pathway to the next stage.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159839/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious evolution here is the visuals, which are quite simply staggering. Everything is composed of 2D sprites, but they're of such high quality that even when viewed up close, the pixelation is barely noticeable. However, they scale and move with insane smoothness and speed, all of which delivers an experience which feels like a late '80s coin-op on steroids.</p>
<p>Factor in some excellent lighting, explosion and particle effects, and you've got a true visual feast (and one which sounds great, too – it has some fantastic music). Yet it's one that is curiously at odds with modern gaming's obsession with hyper-real 3D graphics.</p>
<p>M2 hasn't merely taken Night Striker's gameplay and spruced up the presentation; it has introduced plenty of additional features to make this sequel feel fresh and new.</p>
<p>You can now transform your INTER-GRAY craft into a robot (known as 'GEAR') which comes equipped with powerful homing shots. This state is only active for as long as your 'GEAR' gauge lasts; this is built up over time as you take down enemies or collect special power-ups.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159841/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a risk-and-reward element at play here, as, when your GEAR gauge is full, it improves the firepower of your craft in its standard form. Transforming into robot mode makes boss encounters (of which there are two per stage) easier, but you'll lose the benefit of homing shots when you return to INTER-GRAY mode – so deployment of the GEAR is paramount to success.</p>
<p>Enemies attack in waves, and many of these include a red 'captain' – take them out, and the entire wave is destroyed, lending things a welcome sense of tactical depth. Your shield is capable of taking five hits by default, but you'll gain additional levels (or replenish spent shields) if you take down a particular enemy and when you complete each stage.</p>
<p>As well as the standard mode (which offers three difficulty settings), you have 'Pacifist Mode', where your offensive capabilities are removed and the goal is simply to avoid incoming fire. This might sound pointless, but this mode is, in reality, the perfect way to hone your evasive skills for the 'main' mode. Much of the challenge in Night Striker Gear revolves around avoiding enemy shots, and there's no better way of perfecting those skills than in Pacifist Mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are multiple endings to encounter depending on which route through the game you take, and accessing the final 'G' zone requires you to fulfil specific objectives (as far as I can gather, getting a 'Wipe Out' bonus on any level – killing every single enemy – unlocks it). Add in unlockable modes and there's a lot of longevity on offer here – much more than the seemingly simple premise might suggest.</p>
<p>It's also an incredibly challenging experience, especially on 'Normal' and 'Hard' settings – so much so that Iuchi has taken a leaf out of his Radiant Silvergun playbook by increasing your available stock of continues (three to begin with) the longer you play. This not only encourages repeat runs but also serves to make things a little easier as time goes on. Online leaderboards further enhance the game's long-term appeal.</p>
<p>While Night Striker Gear's twitch gameplay is quite straightforward — which should come as no surprise, given its arcade heritage — the stern challenge, multiple routes (and endings), online rankings and unlockable content make it a surprisingly deep package, especially when you take the low price into account.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Space Harrier-style gameplay might not be to everyone's tastes, but the visuals are absolutely jaw-dropping, and it's almost worth the asking price alone in order to experience them. While Night Striker Gear's appeal won't last forever, it's such an incredible audio-sensory thrill ride that you can easily forgive it for any shortcomings relating to its longevity.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of this style of game and love chasing high scores, then this is a near-essential purchase. Like so many of Sega and Taito's 'Super Scaler' efforts from the '80s and '90s, Night Striker Gear is one of those games you simply <em>have</em> to experience at least once, even if the ride doesn't last forever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is finally here, and before you jump into Obsidian Entertainment's new space-faring adventure in its dystopian world, this guide will help give you a leg-up with some tips and tricks to survive and thrive in The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>It should go without saying that I won't be delving into any story spoilers, but incase it needed to be said, there it is. If you want to check out more about The Outer Worlds 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">then go look at my full review for the game.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide">The Outer Worlds 2 Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-abl-always-be-looting">ABL: Always Be Looting</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's no such thing as carrying too much or your bag being too heavy and making you move slower in The Outer Worlds 2, so it's in your best interest to pick up everything that's not nailed down. Loot it all! Show no remorse! Plunder every corpse, unlocked box, locked box, safe, anything you can get your hands on.</p>



<p>But be aware when you're trying to grab something that'll be marked as 'Stolen.' You can steal without repercussions so long as there's no one nearby to see you do it. If there's a witness, however, you'll lose standing with whichever faction you've just stolen from. Not much at first, but keeping it up will make it all the more difficult to go into towns and settlements safely and without being attacked. </p>



<h3 id="h-preach-speech">Preach Speech</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Realistically, you can build your character however you like, putting all your points into a few, multiple, or even just one skill on your journey to the level cap at level 30. Each time you level up you get to two Skill Points to spend however you like, and making those choices are all part of the RPG side of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>But if I could make one recommendation, it would be to level up your Speech skill. Talking to people is arguably half of the whole gameplay experience in The Outer Worlds 2, and while different skills can give you different conversation options, Speech is the skill to level to solve most problems without violence, convince others of your point of view, and, frankly, the one that gives you more interesting conversation options.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-underestimate-the-power-of-shock-and-plasma">Don't Underestimate the Power of Shock and Plasma</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With how many different weapons there are in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll practically be tripping over them and the weapon modifications you can make. Tweaking and adjusting your loadout is key to ensuring that you can survive any encounter you have.</p>



<p>But don't put too much stock into the overall damage output number that appears with each weapon. Pay much more attention to the kinds of elemental damage you can do with different elemental modifications, specifically Plasma and Shock.</p>



<p>A weapon with Plasma damage that technically has a lower overall damage number compared to a weapon without Plasma damage will do more damage overall, with how Plasma effects can stack, and with how Plasma does damage to enemies over time. The same goes for Shock damage, which is especially effective against the automechanical enemies you'll face.</p>



<p>You're essentially always better off going with elemental damage for your weapons over base damage stats.</p>



<h3 id="h-some-companions-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Companions are More Useful Than Others</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the course of your journey in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll recruit six companions who join you on your adventures, with two of them coming outside of the ship with you. Each of them can help you in different ways, with some being more useful in combat while others are better to have around when you're exploring. </p>



<p>Again, picking which companions join you when you get out of your ship is part of the role-playing you'll do in The Outer Worlds 2, but one of the first two companions you get in the game is arguably the most useful to keep around in your party at all times, and that's Niles.</p>



<p>He's great for taking heat off you in combat, but where his usefulness really lies is outside of it, because you'll always be able to turn to him and craft ammo, weapon mods, armor mods, updates for your companions; pretty much anything you can do at a Workbench, Niles can do for you on the go.</p>



<p>Yes, you'll be able to find Workbenches at different spots in The Outer Worlds 2, but when you're in the middle of trekking across one of the planets you explore in the Arcadia system, particularly early on in the game, it's easy to find yourself low on ammo and health. Having Niles with you means you can use the resources you've collected to keep yourself going, without having to fast-travel back to a town to restock and make the trek back out to where you were, which you'll have to do on foot because running across the map is the only way to get from place to place until you've unlocked fast travel points.</p>



<h3 id="h-do-drugs-keep-your-health-up">Do Drugs, Keep Your Health Up</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, I'm not actually advocating you do drugs in real life. But within The Outer Worlds 2, your inhaler, which is essentially a toxic drug that refills your health bar and can kill you if you overdose on it, is an important element to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Specifically, you'll want to keep an eye on how many Inhaler Charges you have at any given time. Running out means you can't heal while in combat, even if you know you have food resources in your inventory, ready for you to eat. You can eat them outside of combat, but not during. Your Inhaler is the only way to stay alive in the middle of a fight, and you'll always want to make sure you have enough charges to get you through any situation.</p>



<p>Basically, you'll want to craft as many charges as possible and/or purchase and collect as many resources as possible to give you additional charges. Right from the beginning of the game, you can have as many charges as you have the resources for, so stocking up on as many as possible ensures you'll be able to get through any fight, so long as you give yourself the time and space to let the charge heal you, and let your toxicity drain. </p>



<p>Speaking of toxicity drain, another point is to find armour that drains your toxicity faster as soon as possible. Draining your toxicity level faster means you can use your Inhaler sooner and more often in combat, to help you get through any situation. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>stopped including every monster in every game with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fans-i-need-yall-to-shut-up-about-dexit-1839949110"><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i></a><span>, someone’s favorite probably gets left behind in each new release. Sure, they might show up in the next game or two, but there are over 1000 of these guys now, and everyone’s bound to get benched now and then. Up until last week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><span>only three Pokémon could claim to be catchable in every single RPG</span></a><span>. Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is out, two of those are off the list, leaving only one left in every game. And no, it’s not Pikachu, the electric mouse and mascot of the whole franchise.</span></p> <p><span>Magikarp is, as of this writing, the only Pokémon you can obtain normally in every </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG. This means without trades, hacks, or anything outside the scope of the game. The floundering fish that evolves into one of the most fearsome monsters in the franchise has kept this streak for almost 30 years, thanks to a salesman in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span> who would give you the water Pokémon. </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>was the combo breaker for almost every other Pokémon because its dex was made up almost entirely of brand new Pokémon from the Unova region, meaning Pikachu, Charizard, and many other mainstays were only available in the post-game. Psyduck and Magnemite were also catchable in </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>through some extremely roundabout means, but they were there, too.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638880">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Now, however, Psyduck and Magnemite are nowhere to be found in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. This might change with the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, as they were both reinstated to the ranks of Magikarp through </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>’s DLC, but for now, there’s no sign of the headache-ridden duck or the sentient magnets, making Magikarp the reigning champ. For now, at least.
