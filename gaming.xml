			<p>The Remedy Entertainment's multiplayer game set in the Control universe previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-multiplayer-spin-off-condor-infographic-reveals-new-details/">Condor</a> has been officially revealed as FBC Firebreak today.</p>
<p>A new trailer shown during today's Xbox Partner Showcase provided the first look at the very first multiplayer game developed by the Finnish development studio which, in no way, is a Control DLC and not its sequel, according to Game Director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Official Announcement Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBO__RWUbKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak is a 3-player cooperative first-person shooter set within the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). As the Bureau’s headquarters faces a deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces, only Firebreak—its most adaptable response unit—has the skills and courage to restore order.</em></p>
<p>In a new preview posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>, Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha provided a quick overview of the game, saying that FBC Firebreak will be a game that will be easy to get into, featuring multiple hectic co-op missions that will showcase Remedy's creativity fans have come to know over the years.&nbsp;While taking on paranormal threats as the responders of the Federal Bureau of Control, players won't fail to notice how the studio's DNA will be evident right from the start, despite the game not looking that different from other modern co-op FPS games.</p>
<p>FBC Firebreak will launch sometime in 2025 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game will also be available from day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>
Developers Unknown Worlds and publishers Krafton have given us our first proper look at their next open world exploration sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, which will launch on PC via Xbox Game Preview in 2025. It'll support four player co-op, alongside the returning singleplayer survive-o-buildy experience, and it'll take place on a brand new planet. Here's the reveal trailer.

"Whether you're bringing the experience of your previous adventures with you, or are new to the Subnautica games, you'll get to explore lush new environments, encounter fascinating creatures around every corner, and uncover the secrets at the core of this mysterious planet," comments a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/subnautica-2-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox NewsWire</a>. "But as familiar as things might seem to seasoned players at first glance, Subnautica 2 will offer new and unique experiences that will keep you on your... fins."
</p>
<p>
As for the "hotly requested" co-op multiplayer, it'll come with the initial Xbox Game Preview launch next year. The developers are careful to point out that if you're one of "those who prefer the eerily beautiful solitude of solo play, Subnautica 2 will still provide that familiar experience, and prove equally as challenging."
</p><p>
Beyond that, expect "new and improved tools, vehicles, and base building" and "a whole host of creatures big and small, the likes of which have never been seen before". I imagine that's one of the new critters in the trailer - a leviathan of some kind, by the looks of things, with bioluminescent fittings and tentacles.</p>
<p>Sure sounds like a sequel, doesn't it? It's nice to have this one out in the open, finally - the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-subnautica-2-developers-are-hiding-teaser-images-in-the-first-games-time-capsules">have been releasing teaser images of Subnautica 2 in the first game's time capsules</a>. To answer the obvious question - I don't know whether this means it's not coming to Steam, Epic Games Store or other PC storefronts, but it sounds like it's a Microsoft-only joint for the minute.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-eleven-reveals-blindfire-and-launches-early-access.1012671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/double-eleven-reveals-blindfire-and-launches-early-access/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>During Tuesday’s Xbox Partner Preview event, Double Eleven revealed its brand new game Blindfire. In addition, the game has launched in early access on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>



<p>Blindfire is a first-person arena shooter where everything is dark and overall visuals are limited. Players have to rely on their abilities and senses in order to find opponents and take them out.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Blindfire | Official Reveal and Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQP3AmAVle0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In speaking with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/blindfire-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, lead designer Matt Dunthorne explained that the idea for the game came from one of the company’s “Shatterday” exercises where groups within the company come up with hypothetical challenges.</p>



<p>“As soon as I heard the pitch, I knew it was something special – there was electricity in the room when they spoke about it and I couldn’t get it out of my head for days afterwards,” Dunthorne said. “The beautiful thing about the concept in my opinion is how pure the core idea is, there is no fluff or excess and it can be explained in a single sentence.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>The game features a main mode called Bodycount that is played either as a team or Free-For-All. The matches support up to eight players at a time.</p>



<p>Within the game, Blindfire utilizes an echo mechanic that shows the outline of your immediate surroundings to help find enemies and keep your bearings in order. There’s also a “Last Known Position” ability that will show the latest steps of opponents. </p>



<p>Regarding weapons, Double Eleven has every player using the same abilities and weapons at the start of early access. There is a pistol call the Mantis and a shotgun called Abolition. More weapons will be added as the game develops, but the goal is to not have what they call traditional loadouts for players.</p>

At launch, the new interface will include three main hubs: Home, All Games, and Store. Each hub displays all of its content on one page, eliminating the need to scroll.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/bo6-codhq-ui-image-tout-1729179540332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>From October 25, Black Ops 6 and Warzone will be shown on the Home tab. Other games are accessible via the All Games tab. There’s a Last Played tile, too, which gives players quick access to what they played most recently.</p><p>You’ll need to cycle to the All Games tab to view your full library of Call of Duty games dating back to 2019’s Modern Warfare. You’ll cross-launch into owned titles, buy unowned titles, and manage your installations from there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/bo6-codhq-ui-image-002-1729179598209.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Call of Duty players will actually be able to check out the new Call of Duty UI from October 21 after downloading the pre-launch update. It’ll evolve over time, too. Here’s the plan, per Activision:</p><p><strong>Phase 1: pre-Black Ops 6 Launch (October 21 – October 24)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Initially, there will be a transition period from October 21 through 24 when the new UI goes live before Black Ops 6 launches.</li><li>During these few days, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone will be the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab and players will cross-launch into those games. Modern Warfare III will retain its legacy UI. Call of Duty: Warzone will retain its legacy UI until the Season 01 update.</li><li>The Store tab will direct players into the full Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone in-game stores via cross-launch.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase 2: post-Black Ops 6 launch (October 25 – [Redacted])</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>When Black Ops 6 launches, it will replace Modern Warfare 3, making Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab. Players will be able to instantly access Black Ops 6 and cross-launch into Call of Duty: Warzone.</li><li>Players who wish to continue playing Modern Warfare 3 can access it via cross-launch on the All Games tab or the Last Played Tile if that’s the content you’ve played most recently.</li><li>For players who have purchased Black Ops 6, the Store tab will now direct you to the full Black Ops 6 in-game store.</li><li>Black Ops 6 will have its own individual user interface designed to easily get players into the modes and content they want to play. Players can access Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies from the Black Ops 6 game UI.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Project Ethos is a new free-to-play third-person hero extraction shooter that mixes in roguelike elements. The main game of Project Ethos is an extraction mode. And while I was excited to finally see 31st Union’s first project since its formation in 2019, I couldn’t help but feel that a lot of the mechanics felt like they belonged in games from that year.</p><p>Here’s the thing: Project Ethos is fine as a game. It hits all the right notes as an extraction hero third-person shooter, but my first impression after a few hours of hands-on time is that it seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments. In the preview, I was able to play six different heroes, each, as you’d expect, with their own abilities and weapons. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-1-1729139677756.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This forces players to really get comfortable with that character’s abilities as a secondary, since abilities in a hero shooter are meant to enhance your playstyle. Your gunplay comes first. And Project Ethos has some fun sets of weapons that I thoroughly enjoyed playing with. The learning curve with characters and abilities was fairly low, so new players won’t feel too out of the water entering Project Ethos.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Project Ethos has some fun sets of weapons that I thoroughly enjoyed playing with.</p></div><p>Trials mode is PvPvE, meaning you’ll be playing against real players as well as NPC enemies that exist in the map. The matches you queue into are persistent, meaning each time you enter a game, other players have been playing in that match for quite some time. You can see how much time is left in the match every time you queue in. </p><p>With persistent matches, this means that when you drop into a game, you may end up landing closer to some enemies who are running throughout the map. This also means you’ll encounter players who are higher level than you. Each Trials match has its own leveling system. You earn XP from collecting XP shards from different loot bins you come across, from killing enemies, and from completing events that randomly trigger throughout the map.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-2-1729139693166.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The events that could spawn into the map were a bit confusing at first blush. It was hard to see where some of the events were happening just by looking at the overall map. You’d have to really be looking at your immediate vicinity to find the local event, and then go activate it. After a few rounds of play, I got used to this method, but it was frustrating not to see the minor events on the map.</p><p>When you level up in a match, you’ll be able to pick one of three different power-ups for your character. There’s a pool of 27 different power-ups to build your playstyle. And this is where the roguelike element comes into play. You can earn up to nine different power-ups in one extraction run if you choose to stay in the game that long and level.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can earn up to nine different power-ups in one extraction run if you choose to stay in the game that long and level.</p></div><p>The random events that spawn across the map involve different activities that will unlock a big loot chest with bigger XP boosts, weapon enhancements, and cores. Cores are the big-ticket items you’ll be wanting to collect in each run, since extracting with cores will let you buy augments in the main hub. These boost the ability to get power-ups faster, give you health drops from the NPC bots that you fight in game, and other bonuses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-3-1729139706943.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>None of these augments boost your damage towards other players, though, so it’s fairly balanced in that regard. Trials overall felt fairly balanced in gameplay, since you could decide to disengage from fights if things felt too dicey. It felt like a proper survival experience with your typical extraction shooters. While you could feel the imbalance of characters’ weapons, with one having a higher dps than the other, you still had the method of escaping to offset that issue.</p><p>In the second game mode I was able to play, called Gauntlet, there was no escaping. You’re put into a 3v3v3v3 matchup where you’re playing against another team in a small arena. The first team to score 3 victories, wins. You’re in a server full of other teams since who you face will change each time in a dutch round robin format.</p><p>This format pits the bottom half of the teams against the top half of the teams: Team 1 faces Team 5, Team 2 faces Team 6. By the definition of dutch round robin, you shouldn’t be facing a team more than twice. Regardless, this format was the one thing that worked for this game mode. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Project Ethos ultimately plays well, is enjoyable, and utilizes the extraction and roguelike aspects to its advantage, but at first impression, it fails at being a new experience that players will crave to experience over and over again.</p></div><p>Gauntlet really showed the imbalance of the character abilities and weapons, since you’re forced to face your opponents head-on with very little play space. The sniper character, Prism, is incredibly strong, and her primary beam weapon melts opponents quickly in close range, and her sniper rifle allows her to deal devastating damage from a distance. Pairing that with her E ability, where she throws up a prism field that increases the damage output, makes her an incredibly tough character to beat in Gauntlet.</p><p>In Gauntlet, you still have the roguelike element of having to choose from selections of your power-ups. This further displayed the imbalance of character damage and powers. However, I did like the competitive aspect of Gauntlet over Trials. It showed a lot of promise of what competitive play could feel like in Project Ethos.</p><p>The gameplay loop of Trials and Gauntlet are very cookie-cutter and unexciting. They aren’t experiences that you can’t get somewhere else that you’ve already invested your time in. Fortnite came to mind as I played Project Ethos, and I found myself comparing some of the mechanics that exist in Fortnite that Project Ethos could vastly benefit from.</p><p>Overall, I truly did enjoy my time with Project Ethos, but in the end I was left feeling disappointed with the game so far as a whole. Project Ethos ultimately plays well, is enjoyable, and utilizes the extraction and roguelike aspects to its advantage, but at first impression, it fails at being a new experience that players will crave to experience over and over again.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Where's Batman when you really need him? HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-penguin-review-gotham-city-thrives-outside-of-the-batman/1900-6418282/" data-ref-id="1900-6418282">The Penguin</a> is a spin-off from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-batman-review-riddle-me-this/1900-6417835/" data-ref-id="1900-6417835">The Batman</a>, and the Dark Knight is nowhere to be found while there's a gang war underway between the Falcone and Maroni crime families. Oswald "Oz" Cobb (Colin Farrell) engineered the entire conflict to make himself the new kingpin of Gotham City. But as seen in the new mid-season trailer for The Penguin, Oz has a more formidable foe in Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti), the rightful heir of the Falcone family's empire.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtWkqWJzmLA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mtWkqWJzmLA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Oz was able to temporarily fool Sofia into thinking he was backing her play to lead the Falcone family. He also hid the important detail that he killed her beloved brother, Alberto Falcone (Michael Zegen), in a fit of rage. Now, Sofia knows the truth and she's out to get revenge on Oz.</p><p>The trailer makes it clear that both Oz and Sofia have or will have their own followers in the remaining four episodes of the miniseries. And those forces are inevitably turning towards each other as the battle for Gotham City heats up. It's the kind of situation that some billionaire with a bat suit should really look into.</p><p>Sofia may have the numbers and the name recognition, but this is Oz's fight to lose. He's already pitted three of the city's major crime figures against each other. Unfortunately for the Penguin, he's made a lot of new enemies in the process as well. That may even lead into some strange alliances against him in the weeks ahead.</p><p>The Penguin airs weekly on HBO and Max, with the Season 1 finale arriving on November 10.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Bloober Team's remake of the survival horror classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a> was met with critical acclaim. But it won't be long before the developer returns with an all-new title. During today's Xbox Partner Preview, Bloober Team unveiled the first teaser trailer for Cronos: The New Dawn, a new sci-fi survival-horror game that's coming next year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibQP4F8SyeA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn will be Bloober Team's first original survival-horror title, according to the studio, and it puts players in control of a Traveler. The player's character works for an "enigmatic Collective," and the Traveler's mission is to find selected individuals who died during an apocalypse and use time travel to extract them from the past.</p><p>Bloober Team didn't share many details about what caused this apocalypse, but "the Change" left the world transformed into a devastated wasteland that's populated by hideous monstrosities that will put Travelers to the ultimate test of survival. Additionally, the developer noted that the post-apocalyptic time period of the game isn't some far-off future. Instead, the game takes place in an alternate version of Poland in the 1980s.</p><p>"Following the success of Silent Hill 2, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from Bloober Team," said Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno in a statement. "Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival-horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio’s strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience. We can't wait to share it with the world in 2025."</p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025, but a specific release date hasn't been set yet.</p>

            <p>October's Xbox Partner Preview has been and gone! Here we got a look at the upcoming titles for the rest of 2024 (let's not think about how 2024 is nearly over...), along with a sneaky look at some of the titles awaiting us in 2025 and updates for already released titles. Some of the titles showcased were the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>: Lake House DLC, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and Remedy's first ever multiplayer game FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>Let's take a proper look at everything announced during this Xbox Partner Preview:</p>
<h3>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House DLC</h3>
<p>Thankfully the Partner Preview started off with the most important game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-lake-house-dlc-will-be-another-slice-of-full-on-horror-with-new-playable-character-and-enemy-type">The Lake House DLC for Alan Wake 2</a>. (Honestly why continue watching the showcase?) It's time to go another fun FBC field trip where I'm sure everything will just be fine. This time it looks like people are creating creative with paint.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House DLC will be released on Tuesday 22nd October.</p>

<h3>Cronos: The New Dawn</h3>
<p>It was then time for some chess, guns and spooky monsters in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">the reveal of Cronos: The New Dawn, the next project from Silent Hill 2 Remake developer Bloober Team</a>.

<h3>Blindfire</h3>
<p>Next up was some first-person shooter action in what I'm pretty sure was a 90s club going up all the neon. This trailer was Blindfire and its entering early access on Xbox Series X/S and PC today.</p>
<p>(Sorry everyone, couldn't find this trailer at the time of writing.)</p>

<h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h3>
<p>Like a Dragon is back with some pirate action. Take to the seas in your customisable ship to battle fellow pirates as you gather a crew, play music and probably spend too much time in the casino on your journey to become the strongest pirate sailing the waves.</p>
<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will be released on Xbox and PC on Friday 28th February. (Pretty sure that's the same day as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>...)</p>

<h3>Subnautica 2</h3>
<p>We've sailed across the sea, so now it's time to go beneath the waves. Far beneath them.

            <p>
Xbox provided a fresh look at Chinese fantasy soulslike Wuchang: Fallen Feathers at today's Xbox Partner Preview.
</p>
<p>
Published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/505-games">505 Games</a> (and developed by Chinese studio Leenzee), Wuchang is a dark fantasy game set in the late Ming Dynasty, with the sort of boss design FromSoftware would be proud of.
</p>
<p>
In this new trailer, below, we see our female protagonist battling against a giant oyster abomination, a lady whose fox fur scarf comes to life, a bird-like lady with dancing movement, and (of course) a humongous centipede.

<p>
Before all that, we see the protagonist slicing, dicing and parrying a variety of standard enemies, who die in a fountain of blood. It looks like magic will feature heavily, too, with plenty of colourful effects lighting up the haunting environment, which looks to alternate between the real and demonic realms.
</p>
<p>"Unravel the secrets of your forgotten past in the land of Shu before you are consumed by the Feathering disease," reads the YouTube video description.</p>
<p>
Of course, how all of this will actually play remains to be seen until we can go hands-on and get a proper feel for combat.
</p>
<p>
Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is also not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">Where Winds Meet</a>, or any other Chinese-set Wuxia-influenced action games. Can this do enough to stand out?
</p>
<p>
The (self-described) soulslike is set for release in 2025 across Xbox Series X/S and PC, and will be available on Game Pass.

            <p>
Some two years after it was confirmed to be in the works, developer Unknown Worlds has given a first look at the eagerly awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> - with the underwater survival sequel's debut trailer having now arrived alongside word it'll be entering into early access next year.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 - actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following on from the original 2018 entry and its 2021 standalone expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a> - was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">teased</a> back in April 2022. It later came in for some controversy when publisher Krafton erroneously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-responds-to-publisher-claims-its-a-multiplayer-live-service-game">announced it would be a multiplayer live-service game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fans were unhappy with this seeming departure from earlier entries, and Unknown Worlds (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">Krafton acquired</a> in 2021) quickly moved to clear up any confusion - confirming that while Subnautica 2 <em>was</em> multiplayer in as much as it supported co-op for up to four players, there'd be "no season passes, no battle passes, no subscription" and co-op was optional.

<p>
In fact, the existence of co-op is pretty much all we've learned about Subnautica 2 so far (aside from the appearance of some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-subnautica-devs-have-been-sneakily-posting-subnautica-2-screenshots-in-the-original-game">tantalising screenshots</a> sneakily popped into the first game), so it's probably not much of a surprise to see the feature teased in the game's very first trailer - a cinematic in which a diver meets up with a team mate in the depths of an alien ocean, before a enormous creature makes its presence known.
</p><p>
As for when we'll finally get our hands on Subnautica 2, Krafton previously said it expects the ocean survival series' next instalment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnauticas-next-series-entry-expected-to-release-in-first-half-of-2025">arrive in the first half of 2025</a>, but today's reveal wasn't quite so specific, merely saying it'll be launching into early access sometime next year. Platforms weren't announced (beyond the fact it was revealed during today's Xbox Partner Preview showcase) so expect firmer details before too long.

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>‘s release, Bloober Team have revealed their next horror game, Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025, Cronos: The New Dawn is a third person survival horror game that will drop you into a dark and twisted time travel story, filled with Eastern European brutalism.</p>
<p>Here’s some of the explanation and blurb from Steam:</p>
<p><em>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</em></p>

<p><em>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>You are a Traveler acting as an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport you back to 1980s-era Poland.</em></p>
<p><em>Your mission is to locate key people from the past who perished in the ensuing apocalypse. Using your all-powerful Harvester, you can extract their Essences and have them accompany you into the future.</em></p>
<p><em>In a desolate world filled with ever-present danger, your survival hinges on your ability to strategize and plan ahead. The enemies you’ll encounter are nightmarish creatures, born from the remnants of humanity – defeating them will require you to make full use of your arsenal. During battle, quick decisions can mean the difference between life and death.</em></p>
<p>Most intriguing, I think you’ll agree!</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the name of the next game by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> developer Bloober Team, launching sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The game was revealed with a cinematic trailer shown during today's<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF6rXas66ns"> Xbox Partner Preview showcase</a>, which gives off some serious Dead Space vibes. The game will be a survival horror game featuring a time travel story set in a post-apocalyptic future in 1980s Poland.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sp5X_7OGoBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"Following the success of Silent Hill 2, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from Bloober Team,” </em>said Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno<em>. “Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio’s strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience.</em></p>
<p>Developing the Silent Hill 2 remake definitely did a lot of good for Bloober Team, as Cronos: The New Dawn looks very different from the narrative-driven experiences the team has released to date. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to experience this time-traveling story, as the game will launch sometime in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>A new Alan Wake 2 The Lake House DLC expansion trailer was shared online today, providing the first proper look at the second expansion of one of the best survival horror games released in the past few years.</p>
<p>The new trailer, shown during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF6rXas66ns">Xbox Partner Preview </a>showcase, confirms that the tone of the new expansion is more in line with that of the base game, as opposed to that of the light-hearted first expansion, Night Springs. The trailer also confirmed that the expansion will launch, as previously rumored, on October 22nd on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: The Lake House - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/591RFRnhNEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Lake House's tone being more in line with that of the base game is most definitely welcome, although I enjoyed how the Night Springs expansion twisted the vast majority of Alan Wake 2's narrative elements to offer something markedly different. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its three entertaining scenarios showcasing Remedy Entertainment's narrative and visual design prowess, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a more than worthy DLC for all fans of the base game and the Finnish developer, provided they can keep their expectations in check. The expansion's short length, a little over two and a half hours, and its stripped-down gameplay will inevitably disappoint those looking for something more substantial</em></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The Lake House expansion will launch on October 22nd as part of the game's Expansion Pass.</p>
