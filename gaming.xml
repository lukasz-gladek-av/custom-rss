		<p>Ember Labs is set to launch Kena: Bridge of Spirits on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, with the release date slated for August 15. This&nbsp; Xbox version will have exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a unique Kena Staff, and a special Golden Rot Skin. Fans should also be aware that a physical edition will be released specifically for the Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Josh Grier, Chief Operating Officer at Ember Lab said, <em>“We’re thrilled to bring the story of Kena to a new audience on Xbox platforms. As our debut game, Kena means a great deal to everyone at the studio and the team is excited to share Kena’s journey with more players&nbsp; – we really hope everyone enjoys meeting Kena and her Rot friends!”</em></p>
<p>The Xbox version of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will feature all the content previously released for the PlayStation edition, including the Anniversary DLC. This DLC added Charmstones, Spirit Guide Trials, more Kena Outfits, accessibility options, and the New Game+ mode. New Game+ mode offers players the opportunity to experience the story again with more challenging encounters. The game will be available in both physical and digital formats at a price of $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99, with the physical edition comes with the Official Digital Soundtrack and an exclusive sticker sheet for retail.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/24/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Kena: Bridge of Spirits review,</a> Jim said, <em>“Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a great palette cleanser, not just in terms of tone but the way it’s carefully designed. Well-paced and beautiful to behold with plenty to see and do, Ember Lab has well and truly captured the spirit of the 3D platformers many of us grew up adoring.”</em></p>

		<p>Sony has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/psvr-2-pc-adapter-spotted-at-south-korean-regulator/">PSVR 2 PC adapter</a> that leaked last week is real, and that people will be able to buy it from August 7th. The PSVR 2 PC adapter will allow those who own the headset to tap into the library of VR games on PC through SteamVR. The adapter will cost &nbsp;$59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99.</p>



<p>There is a catch as not all of the PSVR 2 features will work on PC. HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (except rumble) will not work when using the headset to play games on PC. The PSVR 2 features that will function on PC are 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, see-through view, foveated rendering, and 3D audio where supported. The minimum specs that you will need to operate the PSVR 2 on PC are listed below.</p>
<table>

<td>Windows 10 64-bit / Windows 11 64-bit</td>

<tr>

</table>

<p>If you do get the PSVR 2 PC adapter, set up is relatively straightforward. You will need to plug in the adapter to PC, along with a DisplayPort 1.4 cable. Sony does not provide this cable and you will have to purchase this separately if you do not have one already. You will also need to register for a Steam account if you do not have one already to get access to the SteamVR store and games library.</p>

<p>The PSVR 2 is currently on sale through Sony’s Day of Play promotion. You can pick up the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">headset by itself for £439.99</a>, or get the<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle"> PSVR 2 Call of the Mountain bundle for £479.99.</a></p>

            <p>The onslaught of fun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">Steam Next Fest demos</a> you can play right now continues and will not relent. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/card-bard">Card Bard</a> is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

<!--more-->
</p><p>You can't just fire away willy-nilly, of course. Each shooty card costs a different amount of juice (the little orange pips in the corner of the cards). Firing five bullets will cost two pips, firing a single bullet will only cost one. This energy restores over time, so as keen as you might be to unleash everything in a volley, you do have to be more judicious about each shot, especially once trickier enemy types appear. Like the hoppers who leap out of a bullet's path, or the mandible lads who wriggle for you at a faster pace than all the other crawlers. </p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wildcard-cardbard-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Terry Brash</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you clear each stage you get new cards. A trio of splashy bombs, for example, or a machine gun-like streak of fire, or a "love bullet" that turns any enemy it hits into an ally who'll attack their own kind. All you want is to survive as long as you can before the wrigglers chomp you to bits. That's it really. To be honest it'll take you longer to read the rest of this article than it will to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2854060/Wildcard/">download the bloody demo</a>, so if you've got this far, go on. Get out of here. I give you permission to waste some time. No, I have no idea why the game is calling itself "Card Bard" in the game menu but "Wildcard" in Steam. Maybe that was an old name? Or maybe Card Bard is the old name. These are mysteries perhaps YOU can solve.</p>
<p>If you prefer to run while you gun, good news. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkjjQc38uc">Gunrun</a> looks bananas and is by the same developer, Terry Brash. It has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561650/GUNRUN/">its own demo</a>. Not content with making one game, Brash has been making this cardy Vampire Survivors-style autoshooter as well, and it looks suitably crowded. Remember a couple of weeks ago when indie developers were challenged to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-dev-challenges-other-devs-to-multiply-something-in-their-game-by-1000-triggering-landslide-of-chaotic-videos">change a variable by 1000</a> to see what happened in their games? Gunrun looks like the creator did that, then neglected to change it back to normal. Sick.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-never-had-enough-treasure-goblins-next-week-that-changes.888312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170394/diablo-4-treasure-goblins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qPQUC8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions"><em>Diablo 4</em> is definitely on the right track</a> after its current season, titled Loot Reborn, made sweeping revisions to the item game of Blizzard’s flagship action role-playing game. But it still lags behind its predecessors in a few areas, one of them being its relative lack of treasure goblins — those little cackling guys with sacks of stolen gold and loot who inspire frantic chases around the map to slay them before they teleport away, often with a comedic conga line of monsters in tow.</p>
<p id="qXwVvA">Treasure goblins rule. You can’t have enough treasure goblins. <em>Diablo 3</em> introduced the ability to follow them back through a portal to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/8/6944731/diablo-3-patch-the-vault-blizzard-ps4-xbox-one">their own loot-filled realm, The Vault</a>, where you could battle a boss called Baroness Greed for even more goodies. How great is that?</p>
<p id="BNww4M">The good news is that <em>Diablo 4</em> is about to get much more treasure-goblin-centric. The bad news is that it’s only happening for a week.</p>
<p id="mo4ALM">To celebrate the game’s first anniversary, <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">Blizzard is running an event</a> called March of the Goblins from June 6-13. During the event, there’ll be more treasure goblins running around, their bags will be stuffed with more loot, and there’ll also be a greater incidence of greed shrines, which cause monsters (including treasure goblins) to drop even more gold when activated. Treasure goblins will appear in dungeons in pairs, or even larger packs.</p>
<p id="M0vdj1">As another nod to <em>Diablo 4</em>’s first birthday, all players will get a Mother’s Blessing buff that increases XP gain by 25% and gold rewards by 50%. Blizzard said the buff would last 10 days, although it wasn’t precise about the dates. There’ll also be some free cosmetics to claim from the shop.</p>
<p id="aGV8Y3">There’ll be a similar March of the Goblins event, as well as other bonuses, in mobile game <em>Diablo Immortal</em>, which coincidentally celebrates its second anniversary at the same time.</p>
<p id="SxwjUQ">Goblins all round. Get ’em while they’re hot!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides/24170514/version-4-7-maintenance-release-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fIpcwd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> patch 4.7 is coming soon, bringing new characters and story with it. This patch will likely go heavy on narrative, as Dainsleif will make an appearance during these new story quests, and new characters Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos will also make their debuts.</p>
<p id="e3CnpT">Below, we explain <strong>when </strong><em><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></em><strong> maintenance starts and ends</strong>, alongside the <strong>release time of version 4.7</strong>. We’ve also added some details about what to expect from <em>Genshin Impact</em> patch 4.7.</p>
<hr id="iEzQbJ">
<h2 id="T4eTkV">
<strong>What time does Genshin Impact</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Genshin Impact</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, June 4, or Wednesday, June 5</strong> (depending on your time zone), at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>June 4 at 3 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>June 4 at 6 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>June 4 at 10 p.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>June 5 at 7 a.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>June 5 at 9 a.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="IAdoB6">Make sure to burn your fuel before maintenance starts, if you wanted to.</p>
<hr id="bvHqwW">
<h2 id="dIJyU6"><strong>What time does Genshin Impact version 4.7 start?</strong></h2>
<p id="4nhhcQ"><em>Genshin Impact</em> should come back from maintenance with the 4.7 version at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li id="k7RBy1">
<strong>June 4 at 8 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="4FGns2">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="fFEk3q">
<strong>June 5 at 3 a.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="Qvthe3">
<strong>June 5 at 4 a.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="c5tLfo">
<strong>June 5 at 12 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="fRHGT4">
<strong>June 5 at 2 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="XkQSR0">The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times 4.7 should go live. Usually Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!</p>
<hr id="47ziSN">
<h2 id="9dmzLd"><strong>What’s new in Genshin Impact version 4.7?</strong></h2>
<p id="zHi8mg">Version 4.7 will bring Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos to the game as playable characters. As you may have been able to predict from seeing them in action via story quests, Clorinde is a five-star Electro sword character, Sigewinne is a five-star Hydro bow character, and Sethos is a four-star Electro bow character.</p>

<p id="V4yn6L">The patch will also have new story with Dainsleif making another appearance, which means some kind of big revelation is not far behind.</p>

Aside from maybe giving you a jump scare, this animal will bounce around and damage you on contact until one of you retreats. You might think your only recourse in these moments is to retreat, but that’s not the case. In fact, this Kangaroo hides a secret for you to hunt down.

It will move to one of the other four locations whenever you spot it, so you’ll have to check each spot if you’re trying to hunt it down. As for <em>why </em>you’d want to hunt for it? Well, if you throw a Firecracker whenever the Kangaroo appears, the marsupial will retreat and drop a <strong>K Shard</strong>. Once you have three K Shards, they automatically combine to form a <strong>K Medal</strong>, which you can place in a Circular Recess near the top-left side of the map (next to the room where the giant bat appears after placing a candle).<br></p><p>This hunt isn’t necessary to complete the game’s first “layer,” but it is essential to achieving 100% completion.

You will need a certain item to do it, though, and there’s a good chance you missed it before you saw the credits for the first time (it’s not the Top). If this information is enough to pique your curiosity, then stop reading here.</p><p>Ready for another hint?</p><p>The item you need is the <strong>UV Wand</strong>. You can obtain it after exploring the area that opens after placing the E Medal into the Circular Recess in the bottom-left quadrant of the map (past the room where you got the B. Flame after the seahorse boss battle, there’s a hidden room on the top-right of the screen above the fish head). The UV Wand shows hidden images and messages you can’t normally see, which you’ll need in order to uncover all kinds of codes in <em>Animal Well</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-recommend-id="image://238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A kangaroo symbol can be seen on a wall lit by UV light.

If you still can’t find the Kangaroo, go down this list and check each location again. You most likely missed a spot, or didn’t think to recheck every spawn point after encountering it.</p><p>This objective seems like a grind, but once you know where the spawn points are, you can hunt it down in just a handful of minutes. Once you have the three K Shards, your business with the kangaroo will be concluded (unless you insist on finding some of the game’s <em>incredibly </em>esoteric secrets, but that’s neither here nor there). Enjoy your newfound medal!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <div><p>Steamforged Games has acquired the hit miniature fantasy wargame <em>Warmachine</em>, as well as the whole <em>Iron Kingdoms </em>IP (including the RPG line) from publisher Privateer Press.</p>

<p>You likely know Steamforged Games more from their video game tabletop adaptations in recent years, where they've been hit or miss.

<p><em>Warmachine </em>is one of the hotter miniature warfare games out there with Privateer Press working to revitalize it with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/privateer-press-announces-warmachine-mkiv" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Privateer Press Announces Warmachine MKIV"><em>Warmachine Mark IV </em>in 2023</a>, and it has big fans in Steamforged CEO's. Rich Loxam, a CEO and co-founder of the company said that "almost every aspect of Steamforged's history can be traced back to Warmachine in some way or another," while pointing out that both he, and co-founder Mat Hart are <em>Warmachine </em>players. Beyond <em>Warmachine</em>, the purchase also includes the entire <em>Iron Kingdoms </em>line, including the roleplaying games, and the Formula P3 painting brand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a real wealth of creative talent and, as you might expect, genuine passion for tabletop gaming in our team. In particular, we all share a special kind of love for Warmachine and the Iron Kingdoms. That, along with our expertise in creating games loved by many, makes us ideally placed to collaborate with Privateer Press in shaping the future of a hugely important franchise. There’s a profound sense of duty to nurture its growth and potential, and we take that responsibility seriously. We cannot wait for what’s to come for the players in this wonderful world.” - Mat Hart CCO and Founder of Steamforged</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What does this mean for <em>Warmachine</em> going forward?</h2>

<p>According to the announcement, Steamforged will work with Privateer Press going forward on developing the game, and releasing new products. Rich Loxam states that they are excited to bring their experience and infrastructure to "take Warmachine into its next era." There is no announcement about what changes will be coming in the future to the game, or other ones impacted by the move. Privateer Press founder and CCO Matt Wilson said the following about the acquisition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We couldn't have asked for better custodians than Steamforged. Their track record, history with the games, and genuine excitement about the future make them the perfect fit to shepherd Warmachine and the Iron Kingdoms into the future, opening up new opportunities and growth channels for all Iron Kingdoms titles. We look forward to working with Steamforged in the years to come.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Iron Kingdoms</em> IP contains more then just the RPG and <em>Warmachines</em> however. Other products that weren't explicitly mentioned in their announcement but fall into the <em>Iron Kingdoms</em> IP include:</p>

<ul><li><em>Iron Kingdoms Adventure Board Game Undercity</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/widowers-wood-newest-iron-kingdoms-board-game-hits-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Widower's Wood, the newest Iron Kingdoms Board Game, hits Kickstarter"><em>Widower's Wood</em></a></li>

	<li><em>Riot Quest</em>, a alternate universe of <em>Warmachine</em> that is a miniature skirmish game</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september.888276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Larian Studios finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> a release plan for the official Baldur's Gate 3 mod tools. The Closed Alpha is actually available today, though only for a select group of mod creators from the community, which will be expanded over time.</p>
<p>Next month, Larian plans to allow users to register for a Closed Beta event with around 1K participants. The goal is to fully release the mod tools with Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 sometime in September.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-cross-platform-mod-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, the toolkit will enable the creation of cross-platform mods thanks to the collaboration with mod.io. Here's what modders can look forward to when it comes to the toolkit itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Access the editor to create your own mods.</em></li>
<li><em>Upload mods directly to mod.io servers.</em></li>
<li><em>Load levels read-only to look at all the local entities, as well as the setup, and test your mods in-game while creating them.</em></li>
<li><em>Get access to our internal editors for supported asset types such as textures and visual models, allowing you to override them directly in your mod through the developer interface.</em></li>
<li><em>Publish your mod via the editor where it will be moderated and made visible in the in-game browser, or pack your mod locally to upload to a third-party site.</em></li>
<li><em>Mod UIs through file editing. We will provide documentation that will explain how our internals are set up to solve mod loading/compatibility issues.</em></li>
<li><em>Within Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, you’ll be able to:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Download and manage your mods directly.</em></li>
<li><em>Manage multiplayer and save game files through a verification UI.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An internal curation process managed by mod.io will determine which Baldur's Gate 3 mods are available on consoles. As usual with console mods, it sounds like they will be very limited - for example, there won't be any direct level editing or changes to core game elements (like story, cinematics, dialogues, quests, and local gameplay adjustments) due to 'technical constraints' and 'platform-specific guidelines'.</p>
<p>Do not fret, though: on PC, modding outside of the official pipeline (like <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what we've seen so far</a>) remains entirely supported. These unregulated mods may still be packed locally with mod.io’s toolset and uploaded to other mod distribution platforms, according to Larian.</p>
<p>This means that those mods can still be downloaded manually, and Baldur's Gate 3 mod browser will still recognize them and allow you to manage them in the mod load order of the game. However, because they would be local and alter unsupported systems, there will not be embedded<br>
support for checking for updates and syncing to others in a multiplayer session.</p>

But do you want to start an entirely new game? <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>will reportedly have a unique leveling system that will keep players from over-leveling, so getting a refresher on the game’s tough combat might be a good idea.<br></p><div data-video-id="195939" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Where Does Games Media Go From Here? | Ahead of the Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195939,195502,196790" data-current="195939"><div><p>Where Does Games Media Go From Here? | Ahead of the Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21458.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Like the rest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282">FromSoftware’s titles</a></span>, <em>Elden Ring</em> has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282">New Game+</a></span> feature, which might just be the perfect way for you to familiarize yourself with the Lands Between once more.

That sounds simple enough, but this is a Souls game, so it’s not an easy feat, and it’s not a foregone conclusion that every player will have achieved it. Once you have earned the title of Elden Lord and seen one of the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-ranni-questline-ending-achievement-fromsoft-1850083349&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-ranni-questline-ending-achievement-fromsoft-1850083349">many endings</a></span> you will be given two ways to begin NG+.

After reaching one of the game’s endings, you will be allowed to continue exploring the Lands Between to wrap up any loose ends you have. Maybe you just want to do some weapon collecting or you haven’t faced off with every secret boss the world has to offer. Whatever your reason, you can take your time before heading into NG+, but when you are ready, just fast-travel to the Roundtable Hold. Resting at the Hold’s Table of Lost Grace will now present the player with another option, “Begin Journey 2.” Accept it and you are on your way to NG+.</p><h2 id="h6169"><a id=""></a><strong>Should you start <em>Elden Ring</em>’s New Game+ before <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-recommend-id="image://43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-recommend-id="image://43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ahead of the DLC’s release a lot of players who have previously beat <em>Elden Ring</em> are wondering what the best way to refamiliarize themselves with the game is. But is the answer really NG+? It’s a bit complicated. I would say that it depends on how much time you think you have to put back into the base game before <em>Erdtree</em>, and also what you are hoping to get out of it before the DLC drops.<br></p><p>The biggest thing to remember about NG+ is that it overwrites your save file. That might be an issue if you want to play Shadow of the Erdtree upon its release but don’t have enough time before then to replay the game up until the DLC’s unlock location. Once you begin NG+ you will not be able to return to your completed save file (unless you are on PC and back it up manually before entering NG+). As with other FromSoft games, <em>Elden Ring</em>’s DLC will require players to start it by entering through a mid to late-game location. For <em>Erdtree</em> that is Moghwyn’s Palace, a fairly difficult location most people suggest you tackle near the end of a playthrough. If you are able to get to that point in NG+ before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> then by all means go ahead.</p><p>For those who are just looking for a way to refamiliarize themselves with the combat and flow of <em>Elden Ring</em> before the DLC but don’t want to playthrough the game entirely, I would suggest just creating a new character (which doesn’t delete or overwrite your other save files) and working your way through the early game. I find that just playing the game, even at a low level, is enough to get that muscle memory working again at which point you can dive back into a higher level and feel much more comfortable. </p><p>Whatever you choose you don’t have to worry about your level being important, however. FromSoft has stated the DLC will have its own unique <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313">attack power system</a></span> that will be more important than your already acquired stats. Essentially as long as you can enter the DLC (regardless of level) you will be able to play<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em> without worrying about being underprepared.</p><h2 id="h6170"><a id=""></a><strong>What does and doesn’t carry over to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s New Game+?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-recommend-id="image://d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-recommend-id="image://d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The benefit of NG+ over just starting a new playthrough from scratch is that you can take some of your hard-won loot and levels into your next adventure. In the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>, there are quite a few helpful things that carry over into NG+. The big things that you will retain in NG+ are your level, Runes, armor, weapons, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-magic-incantation-spell-tool-ca-1848881054&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-magic-incantation-spell-tool-ca-1848881054">magic spells</a></span>.

To balance out the player’s carried-over strength, enemies in NG+ are stronger but will also drop more Runes.<br></p><p>That’s quite a bit and it’s not the whole list. You will also be able to retain the majority of non-quest-related items and consumables.

There are also some key items that the game allows you to take into NG+, which include Stonesword Keys, Dragon Hearts, Larval Tears, Celestial Dew, and Lost Ashes of War.

<p>During the recent Game Access show in Brno, questions were lobbied at Warhorse Studios regarding the recent reveal of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This follow-up to the 2018 open-world title is set to be a stunning game when it’s released worldwide later this year, but some concerns have been raised regarding how it’ll run on certain platforms.</p>



<p>At Game Access, producer Martin Klíma <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-scope-impacted-xbox-series-s-4k-30-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was grilled on this very topic</a>. He explained that owing to the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s scope was impacted, which meant that the team couldn’t make the game as big as they’d wanted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-only-as-strong-as-the-weakest-link">Only As Strong As The Weakest Link</h2>



<p>Reportedly, the ‘weaker’ Xbox Series S console posed a problem for Warhorse Studios when assembling Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. In terms of technical specs, the Series S has just 10 GB of RAM, which is little more than 25% more RAM than the last generation of home consoles. Not only does this present a problem for those making the game, but the players will ultimately feel the pinch too.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="INTERVIEW: Actor Tom McKay Talks Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZPsFrmOAoM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It has been confirmed that on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will run at 4K / 30 FPS. On the Xbox Series S, that drops to 1440p and 30 FPS. As an aside, it has been noted that on PC using an RTX 4080 Super and 7950X3D CPU, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been pushed to 4K / 80 FPS using NVIDIA DLSS.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018) felt like a fairly huge game, but that was because most of it was spent trudging through forests, fields, and expansive towns and cities. From what we’ve seen in the earliest trailers for KCD2, there’s plenty more to explore this time around, but thanks to the limitations presented by the Xbox Series S console, there will be a little less than intended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-games-consoles-are-holding-back-interactive-storytelling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Agency is perhaps the most important distinction between video games and any other form of entertainment. You have no control over how the characters fare in any book, TV or film, but in games, the power is almost entirely in the hands of players.</p>
<p>While this often translates to how well said characters do in combat or when confronted by puzzles, developers are exploring more ways in which players can shape stories as well. One such studio is As Dusk Falls developer Interior Night. Ahead of her Develop:Brighton keynote, we catch up with CEO Caroline Marchal about the untapped potential for interactive narratives.</p>
<p>To begin with, she observes that there are lessons game developers can learn from the likes of TV and film when crafting their stories. As Dusk Falls, for example, uses many of the same tools from those mediums, which makes it easier for players to get into; after all, everyone is already accustomed to cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>"We're using the same currency, telling you a story on the screen, but then we are adding this agency and interactivity, which is even more powerful and just draws you into the world and with the characters."</p>
<p>Interior Night demonstrated this in 2022 with its debut title As Dusk Falls, an interactive crime drama that follows members of two families across a period of 30 years. Marchal says the team remain "super proud" of the game, which achieved positive reviews from critics, as well as users on Steam and, as of March this year, PlayStation.</p>
<p>In fact, a physical edition of the PlayStation game lands on shelves tomorrow, where every copy not only includes the game on a disc but also a poster and a recreation of the in-game sheriff's black book, which help players uncover more secrets within the story. "We had a lot of fun crafting that," Marchal adds.</p>
<p>For the Interior Night CEO, As Dusk Falls demonstrates what she believes is the full potential found within the interactive narrative video games can offer: the ability to share and shape stories together. She tells us that countless players have told the studio about how they worked through As Dusk Falls with partners, family members or friends, each voting on actions with their phone or controller. Marchal even played through with her 73-year-old mother.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>As Dusk Falls puts players at the heart of a crime drama, inviting them to dictate how the story unfolds</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But crucially, she emphasises that games like As Dusk Falls are just one flavour of interactive narrative.</p>
<p>"The genre is much broader than that," she explains. "When you look at games like Unpacking, Norco, Venba, or Papers, Please, [those] are very different takes on the interactive narrative, all valid, and I think it's great, they're where they need to be. Maybe they are not on the right platforms yet for everybody to access this, because when you know you're on Xbox, you're accessing quite a core subsection of players. If Venba was on Netflix, for example, it would be able to reach a much wider audience, and that would be fantastic."</p>
<p>She adds: "As soon as you need to buy a console to enjoy Venba, you're not reaching the full potential audience."</p>
<p>If dedicated games platforms are the barrier to interactive narratives reaching the vast audience they deserve, that suggests that mobile is the way forward for this genre. After all, smartphones and tablets are ubiquitous by this point – but Marchal observes that the nature of the mobile games market raises different barriers, and these ones hinder developers.</p>
<p>"Mobile is very tricky because it's based on free-to-play, and having a narrative interactive free-to-play is difficult," she says. "There have been examples like Choices, and so on. But it's very difficult, because premium is not a thing on mobile anymore, sadly. It goes kind of against those experiences – imagine playing Unpacking and you've got to pay to [continue]. That's terrible. It breaks the narrative flow, it breaks the experience, it's just not great for that.</p>
<p>"But of course, everybody has [a smartphone] so how do we crack this? It's getting really difficult, because now user acquisition is insanely expensive, and it's an entirely different business. When you are used to 'crafting games' for PC and console, you are like an artist.</p>
<p>You are doing your thing and then sell it as premium. Switching to the mobile model is very difficult, it doesn't always suit the design and the skills."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Caroline Marchal, Interior Night</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote><p>"As soon as you need to buy a console to enjoy Venba, you're not reaching the full potential audience"</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, Marchal suggests that smart TVs may be the way forward. While these devices do have gaming capabilities – there's a marketplace for Android titles on smart TVs – little is known about how many players actually engage with these. Streaming could be another alternative, with Marchal particularly keen to see what Netflix manages as it works on its own streaming offering.</p>
<p>"If that works, it could be a great opportunity for those kinds of experiences to reach the TV audience – which is massive. It's essentially everybody, gamers and non-gamers alike."</p>
<p>But Marchal observes that Netflix's particular offering will be a "slow burn," as its games streaming offering is still in its beta phase, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-less-than-1-of-netflixs-total-subscribers-play-games-daily">only a small number of the service's subscribers engage with the titles available</a>.</p>
<p>The Interior Night boss speculates about potential new models that might help bring interactive narratives to a wider audience. Could a platform offer game rentals, or perhaps offer an ad-based experience, with 30-second spots at the beginning and end of chapters in a title like As Dusk Falls? It's unclear what models might emerge, but that may be remedied by the growing understanding between the games industry and companies in other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>"It's a different culture between Hollywood and the games world," Marchal says, by way of example. "Sometimes it's hard to talk to each other, but we are seeing more and more virtuous collaborations, so I think they are learning. Hollywood is learning to understand the appeal of games, while games with their increased focus on meaning and story and good characters, good character design, are also learning to speak to Hollywood.</p>
<p>"We and many other developers are already literate in story language, but there's still this culture. Culture-wise, it is very different to how they do business. So I think it will come.</p>
<p>Netflix and Amazon are already well-positioned. Apple's got the money, if they wanted. Then it's about the vision of their execs, I guess. Because it's about how serious they are with that – they've got the money, that's for sure."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Unpacking_SOCIAL.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Interactive narratives don't need to follow the same structure found in As Dusk Falls. Marchal cites Unpacking as one of many games pushing the boundaries of storytelling</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Platform and business models won't be the only barrier to overcome for future narrative games to reach a mainstream audience; the key, Marchal says, is to make these titles as approachable as possible – something Interior Night has some success with in As Dusk Falls.</p>
<p>For starters, removing 3D navigation is a major step towards appealing to non-gamers. While many folks may enjoy the story of something like Life is Strange, for example, having to guide an avatar around a 3D space can be something of a barrier. Marchal observes that even core gamers once had to get accustomed to moving a character with the left analogue stick while controlling the camera with the right.</p>
<p>"Remember how long it took you to get used to that? We got rid of that immediately, and when you do that, the trade off is you've got control over pacing, which means you've got control over how involved people get and the tension and everything. You can take them on a journey much more easily than when there is 3D navigation.</p>
<p>"Even if we say As Dusk Falls is easy to play, we just use the left stick and the A button, you have to know what the A button is. Whereas with a phone, everybody has one. There is no friction here. Everybody knows how to swipe, how to move, you've got nothing to explain."</p>
<blockquote><p>"How many memories do you have of great moments in games versus great moments in TV? You grow with them, they change your life"</p></blockquote>
<p>Marchal adds that multiplayer is instrumental in making these games approachable, but emphasises that it's important every player is involved throughout.</p>
<p>"When I worked at Quantic Dream, we had tons of reports from Heavy Rain that were 'Oh, my girlfriend sat with me.' Great, but I'd rather she plays with you. It's not the same thing, like watching a football match from the benches. Levelling the playing field meant everybody plays all the time."</p>
<p>Marchal adds that once the audience doesn't necessarily consider such titles as video games, it opens up the door for more people to participate and feel competent, without having to understand the typical gamer language – elements such as UI, health systems, inventories, and so on.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/as-dusk-falls-physical.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The physical edition of As Dusk Falls contains items that unlock more secrets within the story</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It's about characters, what they are doing in the world and everybody is very competent at understanding people and motivations," she explains. "And we crafted quite a complex story with secrets. Nobody is either a good guy or a bad guy, everybody has got layered intentions and reasons for doing what they're doing – just like in life, really – so every player is very competent at understanding.</p>
<p>"That's part of being broad. It's not just about the controls or the accessibility. It's also about what the game is about. It's about people struggling with real life problems, and then suddenly anybody can jump in and participate on a level playing field."</p>
<p>The final barrier is that, even with minimum friction, interactive narratives are just that: active. They are a less passive experience than watching TV or films; 'lean in' rather than 'lean back,' as Marchal puts it. That means stories like As Dusk Falls are unlikely to ever replace prestige television as people's go-to choice of entertainment, but Interior Night is determined to continue offering them as an option.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not something you do every evening, but when you know you've got a chapter and you know it's roughly the duration of a TV series episode, or there's like checkpoints in the middle, if you say 'Well, let's do one chapter tonight,' you know that you're going to be in just for an hour.</p>
<p>"It's not something that you might want to do every evening, but at the same time, I don't want to spend all my life watching average TV shows and sometimes great ones. When I have a choice between playing Baldur's Gate 3 or watching a show, I play BG3, you know?"</p>
<p>She concludes: "Video games are so awesome. I want everybody to be able to enjoy that. It's just such a compelling experience. For me, reading a book or watching a great show, that's really good. But then playing a really good game with someone you love, it's like the top of the chain. How many memories do you have of great moments in games versus great moments in TV? You grow with them, they change your life."</p>

I'd like to share with you what we learned while porting our FPS from mobile to PC.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why Steam?">Why Steam?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided to port Pixel Gun 3D to Steam after recognizing significant demand from both our players and our internal team. Over the past year, we saw a growing interest in a PC version. Additionally, many of our original players, who enjoyed Pixel Gun 3D a decade ago, have now transitioned to PC gaming. This demographic shift confirmed our hypothesis that a Steam release would attract nostalgic players, leading to a successful launch. The nostalgic appeal brought back many old players who were excited to experience the game on a new platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Development Process">Development Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development process for porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC was initially unstructured. We recognized our lack of experience in PC game development and sought external expertise. We partnered with an external team, who spent 5-6 months adapting the game for PC. This involved modifying the control systems to accommodate mouse and gamepad inputs. The most challenging phase was integrating the adapted code back into our main development branch. This synchronization was necessary to ensure that updates could be simultaneously deployed across Android, iOS, and PC versions. This integration phase presented significant challenges, as changes for the PC version sometimes caused issues with the mobile versions and vice versa. These challenges were addressed over a strenuous period of about a month and a half, teaching us the complexities of multi-platform development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Content Integration">Content Integration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integrating the extensive content of Pixel Gun 3D, which includes over 100 maps, over 1500 weapons, and various game modes into the PC version was a major task. We benefited from having a unified codebase, which allowed for easier content management across platforms. However, specific enhancements were made for the PC version, such as improved graphics for larger screens and enhanced animations for certain weapons. While most content transitioned seamlessly due to the shared codebase, some adjustments were necessary to ensure optimal gameplay on PC. This included tweaking certain elements to suit the different control dynamics and display requirements of PC gaming.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Community Engagement">Community Engagement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our strong and active community, boasting over 5 million monthly active users on mobile, played a crucial role in the success of the Steam launch. The announcement of the PC version generated significant excitement, evidenced by high engagement on social media and over 500,000 wishlists on Steam before the release. This community support was instrumental in driving the initial success of the PC version. The positive reception from the community provided clear validation for the decision to port the game to Steam, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong community ties.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Porting Advice">Porting Advice</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on our experience, here are five lessons we learned and want to share with other developers considering porting their games from mobile to PC:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Understand the PC Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Mobile development experience may not fully translate to PC gaming. Consider the unique aspects of PC gaming, such as different player expectations and gameplay dynamics. Graphics, interface layout, controller responsiveness, and variety all need to be carefully thought out and addressed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Seek Technical Expertise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Partner with experts who have experience in PC game development. This can save time, reduce costs, and ensure a higher quality end product. For example, integrating gamepad support and configuring it properly on Steam requires specific settings that are not always obvious from the documentation. Having experienced professionals can save a lot of time and headaches.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Learn Steam’s Launch Process</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The process of launching a game on Steam differs significantly from mobile platforms. Understanding Steam’s marketing and launch dynamics is crucial for success. From tracking wishlists to launch date planning to avoid clashing with competitors, everything needs to be coordinated. In our case, our checklist had over 30 items. Special thanks to Nikolay B. for his invaluable assistance in compiling this list.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prepare for the First Wave</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Steam’s organic traffic can significantly impact the initial success of a game. Unlike mobile platforms, where marketing plays a more prominent role, Steam’s algorithms heavily influence the first few days after launch. Wishlist counts, launch streams, and community posts create a substantial initial wave. To be fair, we were not fully prepared for the influx of players and had to apologize to our players. Based on our current and potential online presence, I estimate you should plan for at least 10% of your wishlist count in concurrent users (CCU) at launch.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Adjust Balance for PC</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Free-to-play games, especially those with in-game advertisements, need to be rebalanced for PC. The absence of ad revenue on PC means that other monetization strategies need to be carefully considered to avoid alienating players.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Launch Results and Future Plans">Launch Results and Future Plans</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The launch of Pixel Gun 3D on Steam exceeded our expectations. The game ranked in the top 20 grossing games on Steam during its first two days, with peak concurrent players reaching 25,000. Over time, the game stabilized with daily peak concurrent players between 5,000 and 7,000. These metrics have encouraged us to continue developing and improving the PC version. Future plans include regular updates, with a focus on enhancing the PC gaming experience. We are also exploring the possibility of releasing the game on Mac and potentially developing our own launcher to attract players directly. The success of the PC version has also sparked interest in expanding to consoles by 2025.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Our Strategy">Our Strategy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our long-term strategy involves maximizing platform availability for our key games, Pixel Gun 3D and Block City Wars. We aim to ensure our games are playable on a wide range of devices, including low-end hardware, to reach the broadest possible audience. This inclusive approach is critical for maintaining a diverse and engaged player base. In addition to our existing platforms (Android, iOS, and Steam), we are considering porting our games to Mac and exploring the possibility of releasing on consoles. The experience gained from porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC will inform our approach to future platform expansions, including VR and other emerging platforms.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring VR">Exploring VR</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, we are considering the development of a VR version of Pixel Gun 3D. We have already developed a prototype in collaboration with Fibrum, and initial results are promising. However, we recognize the unique challenges posed by VR, such as the need to adapt the game’s dynamics and controls for immersive gameplay. While a full VR version may not be feasible due to these limitations, a PvE version or a promotional campaign with a few levels is being explored. We are keen to gather feedback from the community and assess the viability of further VR development based on this input.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC has been a complex but rewarding journey for our team. The successful launch on Steam, driven by strong community support and meticulous development efforts, highlights the potential for mobile games to transition to PC. By leveraging external expertise, understanding the unique aspects of PC gaming, and maintaining a focus on player feedback, we have set a solid foundation for future platform expansions. We will continue to share our learnings with you as we move forward to other platforms!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every now and then, a weapon in <em>Warzone</em> becomes so powerful that it absolutely dominates the meta. Two years after it last ruled the battle royale, the Crossbow is once again one-shotting everyone, and if you want to use it, we’ve got the best loadout. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">In a secret change in the <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 update, the Crossbow can now one-shot enemies anywhere on their body, which makes it incredibly useful in the battle royale. Of course, you want to get the most out of the weapon and make it as easy to use as possible, which is where our loadout comes in. </p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>This class will help you hit your shots. Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-warzone-best-crossbow-loadout-attachments" data-injectable="false"><em>Warzone</em> best Crossbow loadout: Attachments</h2> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>SO Momenti</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>KR Intlas LSJ-3</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Agent Grip</li> <li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: BlastCap 20″ Bolts</li> <li><strong>Rail: </strong>16-Strand Cable</li> </ul> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">There isn’t too much detail to go into with the Crossbow, as the fact that it will down an opponent with one bolt to anywhere to the body is enough to make this a must-use. Still, this class will help give small boosts to your damage and range. </p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">Most importantly though, it will massively improve your accuracy, which is what will help you hit your shots. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>Warzone</em> perks for Crossbow loadout</h2> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Fast Hands</li> <li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Quick Fix</li> <li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>High Alert</li> <li><strong>Perk 4: </strong>Double Time</li> </ul> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">My <em>Warzone</em> perks rarely change, and today is no different. <strong>Fast Hands</strong> will help you load your Crossbow quickly, which is a must-have, while <strong>Double Time</strong> increases your Tactical Sprint duration to keep you moving around the map. </p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Elsewhere, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> is my favorite perk thanks to it regenerating your health as soon as you kill an enemy or apply an Armor Plate, while <strong>High Alert</strong> will notify you when a player you can’t see is aiming at you. Very handy indeed. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/troubled-sands-of-time-remake-gains-yet-another-studio.888228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that yet another studio is joining the long-awaited (and apparently rather troubled)&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>This time around (no pun intended), it's <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the turn of Ubisoft Toronto</a>, the studio responsible for making 2020's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/watch-dogs-legion-review">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Toronto says it's "excited to rewind time" and bring its "creativity, expertise and updated tech" to the project, which is already being worked on by former&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=1NuMTd41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=nSkrPu8i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>just got itself a new developer.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-arriving-in-january">all the way back in September 2020</a>&nbsp;and was given a January 2021 release date, which seems almost hilariously quaint in hindsight.</p>

<p>Obviously, that date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-until-march">subsequently delayed</a>&nbsp;in late 2020, with Ubisoft claiming at that point that the game would launch in March 2021. Again, we can look back on that date and laugh.</p>

<p>In February 2021,&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-delayed">was again delayed</a>, although this time it wasn't given a new release date, with Ubisoft instead saying that the game would launch on "a later date" so as to ensure that the remake would be "the best game possible".</p>

<p>Since then, we haven't heard much from the project, although it has been delayed numerous times in the interim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=lWdsCqn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=p31eEV1D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two other major&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>projects have been released since the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally, the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was being led by the India-based studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1521519964074749954" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that development had shifted to&nbsp;original&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022.</p>

<p>Now, it looks like Toronto has been brought on to help. Will these two Ubisoft studios be the final custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>If you're hankering for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>fix, though, two other rather good franchise projects have been released in the intervening years: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space">Metroidvania</a> <i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest">roguelite platformer</a>&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>. They're both well worth checking out.</p>

We don’t want that anywhere near this film or any film for that matter,” the post reads. “Please keep it away from the filmmaking process. Thank you.”</p><p>The tweet also tagged writing and producing duo Miller and Chris Lord, and Miller <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/chrizmillr/status/1797050399725121950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/chrizmillr/status/1797050399725121950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took the time to respond</a></span>. He assured fans that <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse </em>will not use any generative AI. He also had some major criticisms about the use of the technology.</p><p>“There is no generative AI in <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em> and there never will be,” Miller wrote. “One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”</p><p>While hearing Miller advocate for the human touch in these films is heartening, any talk of the means by which <em>Spider-Verse </em>movies are made requires mentioning reports of overwork and unsustainable production processes during the development of <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em>. For more on that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out <em>Vulture</em>’s story</a></span>. The solution to these problems isn’t to replace human workers with AI, it’s to create better pipelines for a humane work environment. Much of the response to Miller’s statement has acknowledged they appreciate his stance, while rightfully calling out the alleged working conditions on the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films.</p><p><em>Beyond the Spider-Verse </em>was originally meant to premiere in March of 2024, though that obviously didn’t come to pass.

<p>In a recent interview with the LA Times, Neil Druckmann spoke at length about The Last of Us and the future of Naughty Dog, the studio that he has led (or co-led) for several years. He mentioned that the studio won’t <strong>always </strong>be focused on The Last of Us and that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several single-player projects</a> in the works at the firm, but while doing so, he dropped a juicy tidbit about the origin story of the legendary post-apocalyptic game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-other-mediums">Other Mediums</h2>



<p>In the opening section of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview with the LA Times</a>, it was explained that Druckmann’s idea for The Last of Us’ base story was destined to become a graphic novel. It was a concept he’d been nurturing since college – the emotional, intense story of a man and a young girl traversing a harrowing, apocalyptic landscape in search of greener pastures.</p>



<p>Druckmann wanted to put pen to paper and turn this gritty story into a graphic novel long before he had the idea of turning it into a video game. In the report, it was said that even when Druckmann was working in that environment, he wasn’t inclined to even <strong>pitch </strong>the idea of The Last of Us – until he did.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Immediately the light bulb went off.</p>
<cite>Neil Druckmann on realising he was ready to raise The Last of Us</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 2013, Naughty Dog released The Last of Us to the world, and gaming history was forever changed. This legendary game would go on to spawn a follow-up title seven years later, and eventually, an award-winning television series. From the seed of an idea to one of the most highly awarded franchises in gaming, The Last of Us – which should have started life as a graphic novel – became a super-selling series recognised worldwide for its storytelling and intensely realistic setting.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Ubisoft Toronto confirmed that it is joining the development on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.</p>



<p>The team says that they will bring the studio’s “creativity, expertise, and updated tech” as they join the Ubisoft Montreal devs. </p>



<p>This marks a major step forward for development on the game. Ubisoft confirmed the game years ago, and development appeared to face a series of setbacks. In 2022, it was announced the game would move from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Montreal.</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time!</p><p>We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftMTL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UbisoftMTL</a>. <a href="https://t.co/kksyihIjKG">pic.twitter.com/kksyihIjKG</a></p></div>— Ubisoft Toronto (@UbisoftToronto) <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Last April, Insider Gaming reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive details</a> about the anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. That includes footage sent to Insider Gaming, which suggests that the release is likely far off. </p>



<p>However, now that Ubisoft Toronto is joining development, it’s unclear if the added support could hasten the potential release window.</p>



<p>Fans are also concerned about Ubisoft Toronto appearing to shift away from a Splinter Cell remake. However, the team recently seemed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepared to share news</a> about Splinter Cell.</p>



<p>Combined with Ubisoft Toronto’s decision to move towards Prince of Persia, this may further imply that a major Splinter Cell remake could be coming soon. However, Ubisoft Toronto has not officially confirmed any details about the Splinter Cell remake just yet.</p>



<p>Most recently, Prince of Persia fans were able to try out the Early Access version of The Rogue Prince of Persia when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-launches-into-early-access-on-may-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on May 27</a>. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run.888213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I beat Dragon is Dead’s first boss at 5 AM. I died about 3 seconds later. I thought I was in a cutscene, watching him die, and I was - for about three seconds. Then the cutscene ended, and one of his little skeleton minions whacked me in the face, and I was back to the start. But I knew I had a build that worked. I felt lucky. Twenty minutes later, he went down again, and I kept going. When I finally bought it and respawned at the Fountain of Life, I was happy to drag myself to bed… but I was also already planning the next run.</p><p>What I’m saying, then, is that Dragon is Dead is a game for sickos (complimentary), and I’m sickos. Developed by Team Suneat, who you may know as the team behind Blade Assault, Dragon is Dead is part Castlevania, part Diablo, part roguelite, all pixel art hack-n-slash glory. Throw in some unique RPG and progression elements, and Team Suneat’s latest dish is shaping up to be finger-licking good.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Is Dead - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s get it out of the way: whether you’re traipsing around the corrupted, skeleton-infested remnants of a once-sacred forest or just walking through a camp of tired, worn-down, hopeless soldiers, Dragon is Dead features absolutely stunning pixel art. You can practically hear these brittle tree branches swaying in the wind and smell the desperation of the small groups of soldiers working to keep the monsters at bay. Combine that with some excellent and atmospheric music, and Dragon is Dead is selling an aesthetic - and a mood - from the word go.</p><p>But mood, tone, and aesthetics are only part of the package. Dragon is Dead plays well, too. It’s a side-scrolling hack-n-slash with an obvious reverence for Castlevania - the Spellblade’s dodge animation is a very clear callback to Alucard’s dodge animation in Symphony of the Night - but it marries that with a Diablo-esque UI and loot system that allows you to re-roll individual stats on weapons and armor. The leveling system resembles Diablo IV’s - spells and abilities are segmented into tiers like “Basic Skills” and “Core Skills” with several options and upgrades, and spending enough skill points unlocks the next tier and its corresponding abilities. It opens up some neat build opportunities that encourage you to specialize in abilities that complement each other and build your gear around those skills.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There were two classes in the build I played: the aforementioned Spellblade, who specializes in elemental magic attacks, and the Berserker, who builds Madness by using his Basic Skills and then cashes out for big damage with his Core Skills. They play very differently: the Berserker is slower, tankier, and hits harder, but the Spellblade is faster, has a more generous dodge, and can build combos by stacking skills that use the same kind of magic. Both, however, feel fantastic, and it’s fun to build a cool combination of abilities and spells to cut through the demons infesting Dragon is Dead’s world.</p><p>But what I like most so far is the way Dragon is Dead handles death and progression. This is a roguelite. That means that when you die, everything about your character resets: your level, items, power-ups like Artifacts and Soul Gems, everything that makes your build your build, with only two exceptions: your gear, and Magic Stones, a special currency that you can use to buy gear and reroll your stats. After a few runs, you’ll have a good feel for the abilities you like and the stats you’ll want on your gear to support them. Building up your gear after a run matters, but like the best roguelites, what happens during the run is what separates a close victory from a brutal defeat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>During your run, you’ll come across Magic Stones and keys that will allow you to open special chests, which are always useful, and gold you can spend at stores for temporary power-ups or new abilities; Artifacts, which will let you carry more than one potion, upgrade your health and resource pools, boost your damage,  or give you special perks like making enemies more likely to drop potions or dropping more Artifacts once you open a certain number of chests; and Soul Gems, which offer flat upgrades to your core stats. </p><p>Clearing areas gives you your choice of a pair of chests that contains one of these things, but you’ll also be able to buy them in stores and find them in certain areas. There are also special chests scattered throughout the environment that you can open with unique keys you can find or buy in the store. Artifacts also have synergy, which means that finding two or more of the same type will add bonuses so you can really dish out the hurt if you’re smart about how you build during a run. If you’re looking for depth, Dragon is Dead seems like it’ll have it, but you will have to get a little lucky, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That means that you’ll probably have to alter your build on the fly if, say, you’re a Spellblade playing with a lighting build and you get an Artifact that boosts fire damage. Luckily, it’s easy to do… provided you have the coin. Naturally, environments also change each time you go through them, so no two runs are alike, which is good, because you’re probably going to die. A lot. At least initially.</p><p>At the start of each run, you can only carry one potion, and whether or not you’ll find another one or the ability to carry more than one at a time is largely luck. Sometimes, a run just isn’t going to work out in your favor, and you’re going to die. Because your gear - and your ability to buy more gear, reroll a stat on any piece of gear you have, and the keys to those special chests - carries over between runs, you’re always progressing, even if it may not feel that way. But once you come back to the opening town after a particularly close run and replace your Magic items with Rares, and see how fast stuff dies as a result? You really feel it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re always progressing, even if it may not feel that way.</p></div><p>And once you get into the groove of Dragon is Dead’s combat, it feels incredible. Like any roguelite, a lot of learning to deal with any given enemy is just practice. At first, you might not know what an enemy does or how to deal with them. The first time I fought Longmore, a three-headed tree that serves as the game’s first boss and the guy that kept me up until 5 in the morning, I had no idea how to deal with the insane number of flaming, demonic skulls he was sending at me, and when I got to him, I barely had any health left to learn. Needless to say, I died real fast. </p><p>The last time? I was cutting down the enemies standing between me and him like they were barely there, and when I made it to the fight, the skulls barely hit me. I was wearing items with more dodge, so I was avoiding some of them automatically, but I was also better at dodging them manually. I barely got hit. In my time with it, Dragon is Dead’s progression rewarded me for creating a build over time and being smart with my gear, but it also rewarded me for getting better as a player. It’s a hard line to walk, but Dragon is Dead seems like it’s on the right path.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With Dragon is Dead, I had to stop because I needed to sleep.</p></div><p>I do have a couple of minor concerns. First, while Dragon is Dead’s lore is cool, its writing is a little flat. Characters announce who they are, what they do, how they feel, and then dispense lore without much flavor or personality. It’s a small qualm, but when everything else looks and feels so good, it does stand out. The other is that the UI, especially in shops, doesn’t always give you a good idea of how many resources of each type you have. But it’s early days, and Team Suneat has plenty of time to iron this stuff out.</p><p>Usually, when I finish previewing a game, it’s because I’ve done everything I want to do. With Dragon is Dead, I had to stop because I needed to sleep. In a world where I didn’t have to type this up, dear reader, I’m still playing Dragon is Dead. So far, it’s beautiful, feels wonderful to play, has interesting and unique progression systems that reward long-term planning and player skill, and every run feels unique. If Team Suneat can keep this up, well… the sky’s the limit. For now, I’m left thinking of the next run. In another world, I’m past Longmore, past that cave, cutting down demons and slinging spells like the daylight is never coming. Unfortunately, previews don’t write themselves. But tonight? I’m diving right back in. I have a dragon to kill.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ember Lab’s action-adventure game <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits </em>first launched on PC via Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 in September 2021, with Steam following later, and now it’s getting ready for new platforms. Ember Lab announced plans to bring the game to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on August 15, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">Kena looks pleased enough, but the Rot look positively elated in the announcement trailer.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">According to the reveal, the Xbox version will come with some small pieces of fresh content. So far, these include exclusive Rot pirate hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a special Kena Staff. Those who pick it up on Xbox will also get the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kena-bridge-of-spirits-steam-pc-anniversary-update-dlc-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anniversary DLC</a> from September 2022, which celebrated the game’s first year with Charmstones, Spirit Guide Trials, outfits, and updated accessibility features.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kena-bridge-of-spirits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a></em> has the young spirit guide Kena exploring, taking on enemies, and solving puzzles on her quest to bring balance back to an ancient village. Shortly after its initial launch, it went on to garner accolades, including a pair of awards at The Game Awards 2021 for Best Independent Game and Best Debut.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">In addition to the digital release, a physical Premium Edition is planned for Xbox Series X.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-zomboid-posts-striking-before-and-after-screenshots-for-build-42.888198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboid-posts-striking-before-and-after-screenshots-for-build-42/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=project-zomboid-posts-striking-before-and-after-screenshots-for-build-42<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Project Zomboid </em>developer The Indie Stone has been hard at work on the game’s next major update, Build 42, for years, and it’s finally due to release <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboids-hotly-anticipated-build-42-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in 2024</a>. According to the latest development blog post, in fact, it may be coming soon, and it’s loaded with graphical improvements.</p> <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">Notably, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108600/view/4164219969939382164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Indie Stone has explained</a> that <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s hugely improved crafting system is the last major blocker for Build 42’s unstable candidate release, and that the team has decided to separate the feature into two stages to ensure a timely launch window. “As such we’ve decided it would be a better approach to polish up what we have, and continue the process of bug fixing and polishing the build to the point it would be able to go into the Unstable branch,” says the blog post.</p>
 <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">What this means, in effect, is that a portion of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s new crafting system won’t be out until Build 43. On the flip side, this will also mean that there shouldn’t be any undue pushbacks for Build 42, which is good news indeed. This shouldn’t be a huge concern, granted, as a massive chunk of the new crafting system will still make it into Build 42, and to spice things up further, we now have an even better taste of some of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s upcoming visual glow-up.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Indie Stone</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-project-zomboid-build-42-s-visual-improvements-are-a-delight" data-injectable="false">Project Zomboid Build 42’s visual improvements are a delight</h2> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Certainly, the fact that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboid-explains-build-42s-massive-performance-and-lighting-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 will both look <em>and</em> run much better</a> is a known quantity. The bit we didn’t know, though, is that The Indie Stone is also working on a comprehensive visual tune-up of the game’s existing locations: “With all the improvement, and the new tiles going toward this improvement, then our existing towns were starting to look a little threadbare. Until now, of course,” says the blog.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">To get a sense of just how transformative the upgrade is, check out the old version of <em>Zomboid</em>‘s Muldraugh police station above, and then compare it to the Build 42 version of the same building, featured below: </p> <figure data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Indie Stone</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">The lighting and rendering improvements The Indie Stone has promised for Build 42 were plenty exciting on their own, but to see old locations brought back up-to-spec to such an extent is something else entirely. If there was any doubt that <em>Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 would be a must-play for fans of the game, the featured comparison ought to dispel it.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">For more comparisons of the current Build 41 and the upcoming Build 42’s overworld map, be sure to check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108600/view/4164219969939382164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Thursdoid blog from The Indie Stone over on Steam</a>. Also featured are some lighting demos, new baggies and boxes, and novelty keychains – because why not?</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Now that the inevitable scope creep of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 has been reeled in, and The Indie Stone has outright mentioned an unstable playable build of the game, it’s obvious that we’re closing in on the update’s release. Any month now…</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Have you been playing <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and spotted the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement message, you may wonder what it actually means. Well, that’s where I come in, as I can tell you all about the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement system. </p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">One of the best things about <em>Call of Duty</em> over the years has been the in-game voice system. I still remember the days of <em>MW2</em> when everyone would get into lobbies and trash-talk each other. Now, we also have a chat system too where you can type out messages to both teammates and opponents. </p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">If you’ve been using these systems for mischief, or been incredibly toxic to people in your matches, there’s a good chance you’ll get reported. That’s where the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement message comes in. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Don’t be toxic to your teammates. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-is-disruptive-behavior-enforcement-in-mw3" data-injectable="false">What is Disruptive Behavior Enforcement in<em> MW3</em></h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true"><strong>Disruptive Behavior Enforcement in <em>MW3</em> means that you cannot use the in-game voice or text chats to talk to teammates or opponents. </strong>Your behavior has been punished and can last from a day to weeks depending on how serious your offense is, or how often you’ve been banned. </p>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">This comes as part of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s Code of Conduct which asks players to “treat everyone with respect,” which is fair enough when you think about it. If you’re caught bullying, harassing, or making derogatory comments based on things like race, gender, or sexual orientation, you will receive this punishment. </p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="false">According to Activision, voice and text logs are monitored by both humans and technology, so you’ll not automatically get away with it if nobody reports you. Just keep your trash talk civil, and you should be ok. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date-revealed-for-august.888180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PSVR2 PC adapter, which will allow you to use your PlayStation VR2 headset to play VR games on Steam, will launch later this summer.</p>

<p>We first learned that PSVR2 would get PC support <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-pc-support">back in February</a>, but now, thanks to a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, we know that the adapter will arrive on August 7th and will set you back $59.99 or your regional equivalent. Never knowingly underpriced, eh, Sony?</p>

<p>If you want to use the adapter, you'll also need a DisplayPort cable that meets the DisplayPort 1.4 standards, as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum hardware requirements for PSVR2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=TqV7LzIK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=Df8APyVY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to use your PSVR2 headset to play&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>? Soon, you'll be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the specs your PC will need to have if you want to avail yourself of the PSVR2 PC adapter.</p>

<ul><li>Windows 11 or Windows 10, 64-bit</li>
	<li>Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100 with Zen2 architecture or later</li>
	<li>8GB RAM</li>
	<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with Turing architecture or later, or AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later</li>
	<li>DisplayPort 1.4</li>
	<li>Direct USB connection</li>
	<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul><p>You'll also need to download the PlayStation VR2 app and the SteamVR app, but once you've done that (and assuming your PC meets the aforementioned requirements, of course), you just need to connect the adapter to your PSVR2 and your PC and you'll be ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=AdLQ0ycR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=1ORjClT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This could be you, but imagine that the PS5 is a PC and you've bought the PSVR2 PC adapter.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are some caveats to using PSVR2 on PC. Naturally, you won't be able to play any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-launch-window-lineup-detailed-13-new-games-announced">PS5 VR games</a> on Steam; this adapter is just so that you can play Steam-based VR games with your headset.</p>

<p>You also won't be able to take advantage of PSVR2 features like haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, HDR, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tobii-is-negotiation-with-sony-for-psvr2">eye tracking</a>. However, you'll still feel the rumble of the controllers, and features like the headset's 4K visuals and finger touch detection should still work.</p>

<p>The PSVR2 PC adapter launches on August 7th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

UK high street retailer GAME will shutter its long-running reward programme on 31st July 2024, the chain has announced. This applies to the standard GAME Reward scheme and also the Elite membership tier. 
</p>
<p>
No further reward points will be earned from purchases made in GAME stores or GAME's website from two weeks' earlier - on 15th July. 
</p>
<p>
As of 31st July, you will no longer be able to redeem reward points, either.

<p>
"We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME reward points prior to the closure date on purchases in game store or online to avoid disappointment," GAME wrote today. 
</p>
<p>
"After the closure date, GAME reward points will be reset to zero and the GAME reward account will be closed, you will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME reward points." 
</p>
<p>
Per GAME's terms and conditions, you can redeem 400 reward points for £1 off of a purchase. You will also need to redeem a minimum of 400 Points to use up any remaining balance.
</p>
<p>
The end of GAME Elite, meanwhile, will mean the end of its monthly offers, prize draws and other promotions. Any outstanding paid Elite membership months will be eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
An FAQ on the changes poses the question of what existing GAME reward card holders should do with their soon-to-be-worthless membership card. "They can be destroyed as they will no longer be in use," the FAQ states. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was told of the likely end to the GAME reward programme earlier this year, as part of the chain's ongoing changes which have seen it take up residence largely within Sports Direct and other Fraser Group outlets as concessions, rather than their own bespoke high street stores. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME reward schemes are part of further moves to standardise the business to operate within concession units, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">after the end of GAME's long-running trade-in scheme</a>. Going forward, GAME will be able to sell stock through Fraser Group till software, without the need for a bespoke GAME till with the chain's trade-in product database, or need to accomodate GAME reward points.

            <p>Following news earlier this year it was planning to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">roll out PS VR2 support on PC</a>, Sony has announced the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter.</p>
<p>With this adapter in play, users' VR headsets will become compatible with PCs, which in turn will allow them to expand their libraries with a large number of games on SteamVR. Yes, that includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx.</p>

<p>In addition to the adapter itself, players will also need to ensure they have a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4. A Steam account is also required, and you will need to ensure your PC is up to the task of supporting the hardware.</p>
<p>Here are the minimum requirements for PS VR2 gameplay on PC, as shared by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/?sf273420909=1">PlayStation</a>:</p>

<p>Sony notes there will be some differences using its PS VR2 set on PC compared to on consoles. For example, HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble) will not be available when playing on PC.</p>
<p>It will still support high-fidelity and sensory immersion features, however, with Sony highlighting its 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games. </p>
<p>"While the most immersive way to experience PS VR2 gaming remains on PS5, we hope players will enjoy the ability to play an expanded lineup of VR games on PC using the same headset," PlayStation closed.</p><p>

The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter is set to arrive on 7th  August, retailing at £49.99/ $59.99 / €59.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p>You can check out the full <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> mod FAQ page <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4179982568653520452">here</a>, and players interested in testing mod support during the closed beta in July will have the opportunity to sign up at a later date. As Larian has stated, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">it has no plans of creating DLC or a <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> sequel</a>, so offering official mod support is the studio’s way of letting the community take over the reins of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> development to ensure the game stays fresh for years to come. </p><p>Patch 7 isn’t just introducing mod support tools. It’ll also contain substantial content updates for the game, including improved evil endings, tons of small narrative additions (Wyll romancers, your time is coming), and bug fixes. Beyond Patch 7’s release in September, Larian also said it plans on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4172097464031362567">adding crossplay and photo mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megacopter-blades-of-the-goddess">Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess</a> is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.</p><!--more-->
<p>I'd do a plot summary for Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess, but it feels like this would be missing the point - like introducing a party clown to the kids by making them read his LinkedIn profile. So let's jump straight into the act of slithering through the skies of those gaudy comicbook maps, switching between air-to-air and air-to-ground cannons while avoiding a bevy of unguided or homing projectiles that are ineffectual enough individually, but murderous in dozens. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>There's a touch of latter-day open worlding in the form of radar stations you can hack with your cybernetic crane to clear away fog of war. There are explodables to detonate, often positioned so that you can spark off a line of blast clouds right through a base. And there are special moves bestowed by the aforesaid blood-drinking goddess, like briefly transforming your helicopter into a sizzling green shuriken.</p>
<p>It's a great on-the-go game, based on 30 minutes with the demo over the weekend. The colour palette scrubs up a treat on a Steam Deck, and your carnivorous chopper has a nice sense of inertia when dancing through that ever-thickening canopy of bullets. I was frustrated, then engrossed by how Megacopter handles switching between shooting at aerial targets and those on the ground: this forces your brain to reckon with the fact that the distinction doesn't "really" exist because the world isn't "true" polygonal 3D, a quirk of many 90s isometric games I sort of miss.</p>
<p>Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is out 21st June - you can find it and the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/">Steam</a>. Developers Pizza Bear Games consist of Gabe Miller and Nicholas Hunter, with Robin Ogden of OGRE Sound supplying some rad period music. If you like this kind of thing, you might also get a kick out of the antique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-renegade-ops">Renegade Ops</a> or the much more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/go-mecha-ball-out-today-on-steam-and-game-pass-is-a-swish-blend-of-twin-stick-shooting-and-pinball-physics">Go Mecha Ball</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168972/haikyu-coach-ukai-best-anime-crushes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oGPVgQ">One of the best parts of the human experience, if I do say so myself, is having a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes">big ol’ crush</a> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affection, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” After all, brief yet intense infatuations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade">don’t necessarily have to be on real people</a> (or even on people!), nor do they have to be romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</p>

<p id="gFkzSW">Watching <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review"><em>Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle</em></a> reminded me what a hottie the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team’s coach is. There are a lot of good boys (and a couple of girls!) in the sports anime and manga, which follows an underdog volleyball team on their quest to greatness. But watching the movie affirmed to me that my biggest crush in the series is the man who was initially reluctant to mentor the team, coach Keishin Ukai.</p>
<p id="CLzDRa">Ukai is a bit prickly, but he has a big heart. He only agreed to serve as the team’s coach for a practice match between the their historic rival Nekoma (incidentally, the team featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em>). But eventually, he agrees to stay on, reminded of his love of the sport. (And his desire to finally beat Nekoma in a game!) We love a good character development! Once a member of the Karasuno High School volleyball team, Ukai was initially hesitant to go back because he didn’t want to cloud his own nostalgia for his high school days. That’s a nice little touch of backstory that immediately lets me imagine how his high school days went, and concoct elaborate stories for what his life has been like in the intervening years. </p>
<p id="rfY62K">His gruff personality balances out faculty advisor Ittetsu Takeda, who is polite, plucky about everything, and a bit clueless about volleyball. I just think they have a great vibe as co-workers and eventual friends! </p>

<p id="g8WTrf">On the most superficial level, Ukai is blond — or rather, anime blond, in that he has yellow hair. I have a weakness for blond fictional men — one of these days I’ll try to pinpoint the origin of that response, but for now, I’m simply letting it dictate where my heart lies. And Ukai is hot in that <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-sexy-dirtbag-cook">“sexually competent dirtbag line cook”</a> way, in that he’s a bit surly but definitely not unkind, maintains a certain edgy appearance, and also drinks and smokes, but in a sexy way that shows he knows how to have fun. To me, this is only attractive when the guy isn’t real — but boy, does it hit!</p>
<p id="cSNwFY">In one episode of the show, a few of the players who are struggling with their schoolwork come to Ukai for advice. He lights a cigarette and glares at them with a cocky grin, saying “Does it <em>look</em> like I was good at school?” That’s when I fell for him.  </p>
<p id="AfUHDm">Coach Ukai isn’t heavily featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em> — or heck, even in the TV show. But seeing him in the background of the movie still reignited my crush. Sometimes less is more when it comes to latching onto a fictional character. </p>
<p id="ONSB4o">Or maybe not! Maybe your crush of the week is the main character of your latest TV obsession, or the featured protagonist in your favorite video game. Or maybe, like me, you’ve decided to be really into a gruff guy with a secret soft side, even though he mostly stays in the background. Let me know who you’re crushing on this week! </p>
