		<p>Tim Schafer bust into the Developer Direct stream to show off a bit of pottery-making, and talk about their latest Amnesia Fortnight project, turned into a full and broader project. Kiln is all about creating stuff, and then using that stuff to smash your enemies. </p>
<p>Kiln is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC and Xbox Game Pass this spring.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kiln is all in on the top-down 3D brawler aesthetic for its battling, but it starts with creating a pot to anthropomorphise and then send into the fray. You create the shapes, whether with a pottery wheel or just a ball of clay, attack handles, spouts and more, and then transform that into a create or sorts, as your spirit inhabits it. There’s sponges, shapers and straight edge tools, and even just your hands. Each pot needs to be able to roll, punch, jump, and more, and the game has to dynamically figure out how the moves will work. There’s then special attacks like cups sprouting popcorn, plates flinging pies.</p>
<p>Quench is the main game mode, a 4v4 battle mode, where you team needs to carry water into enemy territory and quench their rival furnace. Larger pots will have greater carrying capacity, but be slower to move, so you need to balance your team.</p>

<p>Success earns you XP and chips to spend back in the hub area, where you can spend them on more creative options.</p>
<p>What’s curious is that this is actualy a fairly old game idea for Double Fine. Yes, it came out of an Amnesia Fortnight project, but it was all the way back in 2017! Check that game out:</p>

<p>Really interesting to see Double Fine bring an idea like this back and develop it further. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Game Freak has shared a lot about their upcoming action RPG Beast of Reincarnation, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and Day One on Xbox Game Pass this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, the game features Emma the Sealer, an outcast from society for being a Blighted One, and her giant wolf buddy Koo. They have to journey across a wasteland where this blight has caused unnatural growths to spread, battling robots and monsters along the way. All we can say is that they had better not even do a fake-out death for Koo, or we’ll be very, very angry.</p>
<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There’s different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo ead in to strike first.</p>

<p>The Pokémon developer is getting much more ambitious with their other projects, with Beast of Reincarnation really pushing what they look to achieve with their games on a visual level, and it’s building around demanding, technical combat, which is very much in vogue these days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised, during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> event, <strong>Playground Games</strong> showed off <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, giving us our first look at the latest entry in the series as it drives across the ocean to Japan. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">new island setting leaked</a>, so <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/">did its release date</a></strong>, which was <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">corroborated by the very reliable Dealabs</a> just hours ahead of today's show, and is confirmed to be <strong>May 19, 2026,</strong> for <strong>PC and Xbox Series X/S</strong>. As for <strong>PS5</strong> players, it's not launching day-and-date, but will arrive sometime "<em>later this year</em>," when the PS5 version is ready. </p>



<p>What didn't leak, thankfully for Xbox and Playground, was the gameplay showcase we got, which, you may not be surprised to learn, was incredibly impressive. The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 event was opened with Forza Horizon 6, with design director <strong>Torben Ellert</strong> diving into one of the game's key differences from Forza Horizon 5. Instead of starting the game as a superstar of the Horizon festival, you start as a nobody - a tourist in Japan that begins by entering the festival at the bottom tier, eventually working your way up to 'Superstar' status.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous Horizon games; in </em><em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5’</em>s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire blog post reads</a>, regarding the shift in starting position. "<em></em><em>Horizon 6</em> almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Playground describes Japan as the largest map ever in Forza Horizon history, with more verticality, and the largest urban district ever included in a Forza Horizon game. It's "<em>a world where every road leads to discovery</em>," Playground proclaims.</p>



<p>Beyond the map, the roster of cars available at launch is also the biggest roster included in a Forza Horizon game from day one, with <strong>550 cars included at launch</strong>. The roster has also been overhauled to include a better balance across the roster.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of updates to how you build out your garage and home, with a full mountain valley for you to populate with garages and buildings to show off to your friends. Your friends will also be able to help you populate that valley, as building is now an entirely multiplayer experience in Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>There are plenty of more features yet to be shown in Forza Horizon 6, but thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer, since we know we'll get the chance to play it ourselves on Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Fine Reveals ‘Kiln’ Almost 10 Years After First Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/double-fine-reveal-kiln-10-years-after-announcement/</link>
            <guid>1413505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Double Fine has taken to the (virtual) stage at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase to reveal Kiln, a unique multiplayer, team-based party brawler, <strong>almost a decade </strong>after it was announced. The game first surfaced in 2017, emerging from Double Fine’s ‘Amnesia Fortnight’ event, an annual, two-week game jam that spawns prototype game ideas.</p>



<p>It has remained silent, aside from some prototype images appearing online years ago, until now. During the recent Xbox Dev Direct, Double Fine finally revealed the physics-based, destruction-laden brawler.</p>



<h2 id="h-kiln-ten-years-in-the-making">Kiln – Ten Years in the Making</h2>



<p>If you try to find any information online about Kiln, you’ll find a blurb penned by Double Fine in April 2017:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kiln is a multiplayer, team-based brawler by Derek Brand with a focus on creating unique player sculpted characters featuring crazy physics-based animation and destruction. In Kiln you play as a Mountain Spirit, supernatural beings forever at war on the summit. You’ll use an ancient pottery wheel to create warrior golems called Vessels, inhabiting them and enabling you to interact with the physical realm to do battle. </p>



<p>Created during the match, extremely diverse character shapes and sizes are possible each exhibiting unique attributes and controls that leverage the possibilities in procedural animation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also in 2017 that Double Fine revealed the developers responsible for shaping the early game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of this was <strong>re</strong>shared by Double Fine during today’s announcement.</p>



<p>Today, during the Xbox Developer Direct, we saw how that game has evolved over the last decade. </p>



<p>The trailer opened up with Tim Schafer, the head of the studio at Double Fine, working on some pottery. That’s basically the core concept of Kiln. Players take clay characters and shape them into whatever they can imagine, taking them into destructive environments and smashing each other to pieces.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>You take your pottery mechanisms, craft ‘pots’, and take those ceramic imaginations into multiplayer battles across entertaining, engaging maps built with the ‘spirit of creativity’.</p>



<p>Double Fine confirmed that Kiln is coming Spring 2026, and a closed beta will come soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Beast of Reincarnation’s release window has been confirmed during the latest Xbox Developer Direct 2026, with the game releasing in Summer, 2026.</p>







<p>The upcoming souls-like RPG is being developed by none other than Game Freak, the masters behind the ever-popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon series</a>. It’s fair to say it’s a harsh departure from their usual titles, but judging from the gameplay showcased, there’s a lot to be excited about.</p>



<h2 id="h-beast-of-reincarnation-releases-summer-2026">Beast of Reincarnation Releases Summer, 2026</h2>



<p>It’s not just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> that takes place in Japan, as Beast of Reincarnation is also heading there, but with more of a post-apocalyptic twist. The footage showcases a deeper look at the nation, which has been ruined by a strange blight and plagued by monstrous beasts.</p>



<p>The gameplay is described as a ‘one-person, one-dog experience,’ and it’s clear that the protagonist’s wolf companion, Koo, will play a large part in the experience. Together, you’ll explore the ruins of Japan and hunt down Malefacts in an effort to cleanse the blight from the world. </p>



<p>And there’s good news for PlayStation fans out there, as it was confirmed that Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation concurrently—no delay like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 launches May 19 for Xbox Series and PC, later in 2026 for PS5]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/forza-horizon-6-launches-may-19-for-xbox-series-and-pc-later-in-2026-for-ps5</link>
            <guid>1413493</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Start</strong></p><p>You start <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> not as a professional driver, but as a tourist, with a dream to one day attend the Horizon Festival in Japan. It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous <em>Horizon</em> games; in <em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game. Horizon 6 almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“Ultimately, I think it really boils down to the fact that so many of us love that idea of going to a place that you don’t know, a place that you’re eager to discover,” Ellert says. “You have this motivation to go to Japan with the Horizon Festival, but you’re only attending as a fan, with a dream to take part in it. That felt like a great way to frame up that big open-door experience and explore the question of ‘what would it take for you to drop everything to fly to the other side of the world to pursue your dream?’</p><p>“Somehow, it felt right in this game to just put you on the ground—like you just got off the plane, you’ve got a couple of friends that share your dream and know the surroundings. It’s a notional projection of yourself in the game, and the thrill of arriving in a new place full of opportunities.”</p><p><strong>The Country</strong></p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> takes us to a new destination for the series—the beautiful mountains and urban spaces of Japan. It’s the team’s most impressive destination yet—breathtaking mountain vistas and passes, neon-soaked city plazas and brooding dockland strips—masterfully designed. However, the goal wasn’t to accurately recreate Japan’s roads and spaces mile for mile, but to capture the essence of the place in a smoother, condensed reality.</p><p>“It’s easy to think of an authentic space as a recreation of a place, but it’s less about that accuracy, and more about the feel of it,” Ellert explains. “If you think about driving in Tokyo, for example, what does that look like? What are the things that make it feel like this place? You’d see it in the distance from the freeways, before passing through the suburbs, then suddenly you’re in downtown, surrounded by skyscrapers.</p><p>“It’s about looking at roads, references, thinking about what you see in each place and how it feels when you turn a corner. You don’t recreate every corner—you recreate the experience of having something revealed when you get there.</p><p>“Filtered through the lens of being a <em>Horizon</em> game, which is a big open world with its consequence-free traversal, we had to find that balance between what it feels like to be there, but also the fun of a <em>Horizon</em> game where you can jump in a hypercar, absolutely spin it off a cliff and earn points for doing that.”</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s sprawling, impressive map is separated into distinct districts, instantly recognizable as soon as you approach. The suburbs are dotted on the outskirts of Tokyo; narrow, undulating streets with telephone wires sweeping overhead, connecting clusters of modest homes.</p><p>Tokyo also has a docklands district, an industrial space piled high with huge cranes and colossal freighters, and there’s a delightful dichotomy between the looming, brutalist architecture built for tiny, bubbly city cars to zip around in.</p><p>There’s also the iconic downtown area, where you’ll see Shibuya Crossing, Ginko Avenue and Tokyo Tower—breathtaking landmarks bound together by dense urban streets, clever shortcuts and hidden paths, but all designed to support <em>Horizon</em>‘s typically fast gameplay.</p><p>“The combination of enormous verticality, glass, neon signs, adverts for all manners of things, with Tokyo we’ve created this ultra-high-density space unlike anything we’ve made before,” Ellert adds. “It’s the most visually, radically different space we’ve ever built for a <em>Horizon</em> game.”</p><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>You won’t end up in Japan alone—two of your close friends are coming to experience this <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,831 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with you. Jordy is a passionate motorsports enthusiast, while Mei is an experienced Japanese car builder, and it’s her character that adds an insider’s perspective to your journey through Japan. That insider perspective was mirrored in the real world by Playground Games’ Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita.</p><p>“One thing that surfaced when our team travelled to Japan was how valuable it is to have someone there who knows the place, who can help you navigate some of the things that even a well-researched tourist might not know,” Ellert explains. “It’s one thing to understand it from your perspective, but that inside perspective is so important when recreating a space.”</p><p><strong>The Journal</strong></p><p>The team knew it wanted to continue the established wristband progression system from previous <em>Horizon</em> games—where players rise through the ranks of the Horizon Festival to unlock better cars and higher caliber races. This time around, with this new setting, Playground Games wanted to introduce another way to progress, one that gives explorers a real goal to chew on, and one that felt intrinsically tied to Japanese culture. Enter: the Collection Journal—a new feature inspired by Japan’s rich stamp collecting history, that lets players build a digital collection of mementos discovered throughout Japan.</p><p>“We wanted this archetypically Japanese experience, but delivered in a structured way,” Ellert says. “When you discover points of interest, that goes into your Journal, and it generates progression towards your rank in the Horizon Festival and your general progression in Japan.”</p><p>The Journal adds a new level of value to exploration in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, linking back to that player freedom that Ellert mentioned earlier, and how these games are built for adventurers, not just petrol heads. It’s also a deeply customizable experience—you can take photos of murals, landmarks, and other notable spots, and save them in your journal, adding a personal flair to your adventure.</p><p>“It’s a visual representation of your journey,” Ellert adds. “It’s a collection of your own specific experiences in Japan.”</p><p><strong>The Estate</strong></p><p>Similar to previous <em>Horizon</em> games, there are eight player houses that you can unlock throughout Japan, which serve as fast travel points, a customization space, and all come with garages where you’ll be able to fully decorate the space and display several vehicles per home. One notable addition to <em>Horizon 6</em> however is The Estate, a much larger piece of land that you can acquire and build pretty much whatever you’d like on. This space is yours to expand however you wish, and it’s also deeply inspired by that same attention to Japanese culture.</p><p>The Estate is grounded in an idea in Japan called Akiya, which is basically an abandoned piece of property in rural Japan. These homes are often passed down through families, and as the cost of demolishing the building is often more than just leaving it, these buildings can sit and fall into disrepair.</p><p>“The Estate is inspired by this—it’s an old property that belonged to Mei’s family, and as you’ve travelled to Japan together, she’s asked you to help fix it up,” Ellert tells us. “Being responsible for an Akiya is really rooted in community, you take on the job of refurbishing somewhere that’s useful and meaningful to the people around you.”</p><p>In practice, The Estate is a flat area of land where you can build anything you want—a mountain hideaway, a personalized track for friends—the only real constraint is that the items will cost in-game currency. When you build something, you pay a few credits to put it down—credits you earn in other activities across the game world—and you get the credits back if you delete something.</p><p>“It creates this sense of connection for us that you’ve worked to get these credits by taking part in something,” Ellert adds. “Winning races, delivering tofu, exploring the world, there’s all sorts of things you can do to generate in-game credits.” The result is a little slice of Japan that isn’t just built by you, but earned by you.</p><p><strong>Car Meets</strong></p><p>With the aim of authentically creating a <a title="Genres > Racing [320 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> experience that reflects informal gatherings as well as professionally organized events, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> introduces Car Meets, a feature also grounded in Japanese car culture. These meets are inspired by the Daikoku car meet—a world-renowned, mostly spontaneous meeting place and sacred ground for car enthusiasts. There are no official events, no entry requirement, and it’s always open.</p><p>There are three locations in-game where permanent Car Meets take place. One is at the Horizon Festival, another is towards The Alps at the Okuibuki parking area, and the third is of course, at Daikoku itself. Here, players can roll up, meet other real players, check out their cars, download custom paint jobs and designs, and even purchase their own version of a car they like. It’s a seamless social space that you can enter alone or with a party of friends, and a neat way to really recreate that sense of community within <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p><p><strong>The Cars</strong></p><p>While <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is built to give players more freedom than ever before in how to progress and where they spend their time, the team is still here to serve absolute excellence when it comes to the vehicle roster. There are around 550 different cars at launch to collect in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, including the newly-revealed <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> cover cars, the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p>The cover cars come to life beautifully in the <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> key art, also revealed at Developer_Direct. The artwork was inspired by the idea of Japan as a land of contrasts; urban, rural, modern, traditional—elements that are reflected through the use of mixed media, paper texture and color, according to Ellert. The visual style was also heavily influenced by the traditional Japanese ink style paintings known as Sumi-E. The <em>Forza</em> team consulted with a <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Artist to ensure the spirit of this artistic style was captured—and collaborated with Toyota to ensure the details on both the 2025 Land Cruiser, and the brand-new 2025 GR GT Prototype are fully representative of what players experience both in-game, and in real life.</p><p>“The 2025 GR GT Prototype is really special to us because it’s our hero cover car, but it’s also a car that you drive as part of what we call the Initial <a title="Companies > Experience [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a>,” Ellert adds. “It’s the first 10 minutes of the game where you get to drive the car, almost as a prelude. You get to do some off-roading in The Alps, race the Shinkansen (bullet train), and get a taste of what’s to come.</p><p>“Then, we take that all away and say, ‘well that’s about the festival, and you’re not in the festival’, this brief experience with the 2025 GR GT Prototype is aspirational, almost like a dream, and it gives you that aspiration to go out and earn that car yourself because it really is an <a title="Companies > amazing [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazing">amazing</a> thing.”</p><p>One final note that Torben does leave on, is what cars have grown to mean to everyone today. While illustrious supercars may be reserved for a minority (or something to be authentically experienced inside a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game), cars are a commonplace item in so many lives and rarely purchased without thought, even by those that wouldn’t consider themselves an enthusiast.</p><p>“[Cars] are often the most expensive things that many of us will own. They are the most engineered things that many of us will own,” Ellert adds. “They are brash, they’re loud, they’re beautiful, they appear in fashion and fame, and they’re associated with celebrity, freedom, and the ability to go wherever you want to go.”</p><p>“And ultimately, that is what <em>Horizon</em> games are for me. They’re about freedom, and they’re about fun, and they’re about beauty, and they’re about community. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is about giving people the ability to go where they want to go in beautiful machines, in a beautiful place, in a fun, approachable game with their frie</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/forza-horizon-6-launches-may-19-for-xbox-series-and-pc-later-in-2026-for-ps5]]></content:encoded>

We got a look at the game’s cover cars, a breakdown of new customization features, and, of course, a glimpse into how much fun driving across the game’s rendition of Japan could be.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign sees players begin as a tourist who joins the Horizon festival and climb the ranks, a departure from previous entries where the player is already a relative superstar. You’ll still progress via the established wristband system, but Horizon 6 introduces a new method of progression called the Collection Journal. The Collection Journal is inspired by Japanese stamp collecting and lets players build a digital collection of mementos discovered while exploring. Players can take photos of murals, landmarks, and other scenic sights to save to the journal as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan is the series’ biggest map yet. Tokyo alone is the largest city in the series, featuring multiple districts for players to cruise through and recognizable sights, such as Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo Tower, and Ginko Avenue. Playground Games is also striving to accurately represent topographical details, from various countryside to mountains and city streets, to add as much authenticity to the experience as possible. Seasons also return, shifting the environment from winter to spring and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Japanese car culture will be represented in a major way. Cars have no customization options and a fully overhauled roster for improved balancing. More cars will be available at launch than ever before, and new aftermarket cars include rare or unique vehicles to unlock at a bargain. Playground also revealed Forza Horizon 6’s cover cars: the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can now build custom structures from any location, and building is now fully multiplayer, allowing friends to concoct creations together. In addition to unlocking player houses for vehicle storage and fast travel, you’ll also unlock a new destination called The Estate. This giant plot of land gives players a blank canvas to build what they want. What begins as a rural section of land can be transformed into mountain hideaways, your own personal race track, a factory complex, and more, based on items purchased using in-game currency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another new feature is Car Meets, inspired by the real-world Daikoku car meet. This social space is always available to join, and it lets players meet up, share custom paint jobs and designs, and purchase their own versions of cars they like.&nbsp;</p><p>New driving features include Auto-drive and proximity radar. In terms of accessibility options, Forza Horizon 6 features a customizable high-contrast mode to help make the game easier to play for the visually impaired.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a tantalizing tease of a pair of giant robotic feet stepping behind a vehicle that looked suspiciously like a Gundam. Given Forza Horizon’s penchant for crossover content, odds are we’ll be piloting a mobile suit, which is the perfect fit given the setting.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Xbox's Developer Direct today, Double Fine took a surprise spot on the virtual stage to announce its charming new pottery party game, Kiln.</p><p>Developed as part of Double Fine's internal game jam Amnesia Fortnight, Kiln is a multiplayer party brawler where you build pots and destroy them. Per today's Xbox Developer Direct, the drive behind Kiln is allowing players to build creatively, and then letting them destroy each other's creations. The Quench mode, for example, tasks players with picking up &nbsp;and carrying water to their enemies' kiln, with the goal of dousing it for the win. It's reminiscent of a MOBA in some ways, or Splatoon, or maybe just multiplayer objective-based games in general.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of options for shaping and sculpting your pottery, with detection tools for identifying specific shapes like bowls or cups. Once they enter the arena, they can run, jump, and attack, and each shape also has different special attacks all their own. Plates can fling a pie, for example. Maps range from dance floors to ancient history, with different lanes and avenues. Some paths might only be accessible for specific shapes, giving a small advantage to the little cups.</p><p>Kiln is set to arrive in spring 2026 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Double Fine plans to host a beta ahead of that launch, with specific details yet to be announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/double-fine-announces-online-multiplayer-pottery-brawler-kiln]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Beast of Reincarnation got a new gameplay presentation at the Xbox Developer Direct, as well as a Summer 2026 release window</p>
<p>The game focuses on Emma and Koo, in a post-apocalyptic 4026 Japan in which a mysterious Blight has taken over much of the world. Emma, being able to absorb this Blight inside herself, plays an important role in defeating the Beast of Reincarnation. Very exciting!</p>
<p>The game shows dynamic movement, powered through the main character Emma's vine hair that can be used to propel her upwards and build makeshift bridges. This is a core part of the plant theme of Beast of Reincarnation, with flora making up much of not only the setting, but being a gameplay focus too. There are also Malefacts, creatures fused from plants and animals.</p>

<p>There is not only Blighted plant life standing in your way, but Golems! These are mechanical bodies which humans transferred their souls into.</p>
<p>The game also features a spin on the typical real-time action RPG with Blooming Arts, which slows down the gameplay and allows you to perform a selection of special attacks. This, as shown in the presentation, allows for a large variety of gameplay styles.</p>
<p>The game can be wishlisted now, and will be available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.

            <guid>1413463</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> is set to launch on 19th May 2026, arriving first for Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Game Pass with an eventual PlayStation 5 release coming at a later point this year, Microsoft has announced alongside a deep dive into the gameplay by Playground games during the Developer Direct stream.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Forza Horizon 6 looks to take the familiar arcade racing format of the series to the next level, thanks in no small part to being fully on this generation, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was a cross-gen release. The game still takes liberties with reality to create a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but the team at Playground Games has brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism” – things like picking 78 as the building number for your first home base, which is lucky in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Once again the Horizon Festival is at the centre of all the racing that you’re taking on. The journey through the game starts as a tourist to Japan, having to first qualify for the Festival, earning wristbands and taking challenges to prove you’re worthy for the next stage and series of events. There’s a new event here with Horizon Rush, tasking you with weaving through obstacle courses to prove your skills. At the end of the road is&nbsp;Legend Island, an exclusive region of the world that only the pinnacle are able to visit.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seasons will also make a return to Forza Horizon 6, and should be as impactful for the Japanese weather as they were for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and its wildly different British seasons. Cherry blossoms in the spring are going to be delightful to see, and they’ll respond realistically to passing cars. It’s built around a ton of photogrammetric data capture of the world, providing the foundation for the world – within that, Tokyo City is five times larger than any urban city before, featuring multiple distinct and visually different districts, but there’s also a broad countryside too.</p>

<p>The team has overhauled the car roster to be better balanced, with the hundreds of cars that have new Forza body kits, liveries that extend to the wind screen, but there’s also some unique creations to collect. Oh, and there’s also authentic tyre wear. The Forza Horizon 6 cover star is the Toyota Gazoo Racing GR GT. It’ll sound great, thanks to new environmental audio processing, hours of ambient sound capture from different seasons.</p>
<p>The shared open world returns with thematic open car meets, where you can turn up and show off your car, and even then just buy copies of the cars that you see. That then bleeds into driving and racing together.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer, they promise, will be easier to get into than ever, and more extensive with full collaborative multiplayer world building tools that you can dive into.</p>
<p>The game’s accessibility suite is pushing on with features like proximity radar for competitive racing, auto drive for when you just want to kick back, and a&nbsp;customisable high contrast mode to aid visually.</p>
<p>The key thing that we’ll have to wait and see is how much this game feels like a new step for the series. There was criticism for Forza Horizon 5 that is was often very similar to Horizon 4, in terms of the cars on offer, the overarching progression and the feel, despite having leapt across from Britain to Mexico. We do expect Horizon 6 to still be an evolution of the formula instead of a wholesale reinvention, but hopefully there’s some more distinguishing touches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio recently released a new demo for<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami,</em> an upcoming remake of the original PS3-era <em>Yakuza 3.</em> And a single alleyway in the demo has become the center of an online debate about whether<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> is a visual downgrade when compared to the OG game.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948220/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties_Demo/">Sega released a demo for <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</a> It didn’t take long after the demo’s launch for people to start complaining about the remake. Some aren’t happy that, like in the OG game, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qj4cdi/damn_kiwami_3_is_crazy_faithful_to_yakuza_3/">every character you fight is an expert at blocking.</a> Others claim that the remake’s map is smaller than the original’s and are unhappy about it. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">There’s also the crappy decision by RGG to recast a character with actor Teruyuki Kagawa</a>, a man who has been accused of sexual assault against a hostess in 2019. While he apologized in 2022, people are still upset that he’s included in the remake. But the newest and biggest controversy surrounding <em>Kiwami 3</em> involves an alleyway found in the demo.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wj9u8chpW5">pic.twitter.com/wj9u8chpW5</a></p> <p>— Yakuza Spain 🐉 (@SpainYakuza) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpainYakuza/status/2014115748491252142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 21, a user on Twitter shared a post comparing an alley in the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> on PS3 with how it looks in the remake’s demo. While the original looks realistic and inviting, the remake’s version looks garish and ugly. However, the original account claimed that the rest of the demo looked better and was on par with recent RGG games. Another user pointed out that the alleyway looks fine when you aren’t inside of it, and <a href="https://x.com/Kami_No_Okami/status/2014382700677706178">someone else suggested it was tied to a technical issue involving the game’s lighting</a>. This is a problem that has plagued past <em>Yakuza/Like a Dragon</em> games, including <em>Pirates in Hawaii.&nbsp;</em></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yakuza Kiwami 3 lighting issues are an auto-exposure bug.</p> <p>When in a dark area, the game brightens to make things easier to see, which overexposes bright areas and makes things look fullbright.</p> <p>The fix is as easy as disabling this, but Pirates in Hawaii had the same issue. <a href="https://t.co/hVu5OaUYzw">pic.twitter.com/hVu5OaUYzw</a></p> <p>— MeovvCAT (@osu_MeovvCAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/osu_MeovvCAT/status/2014364282725474705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That information didn’t stop the original post comparing the old and new game from going viral online, <a href="https://x.com/kitsuneredFES/status/2014250516977492350">leading to more people sharing footage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/exblackwater/status/2014149801554633074">screenshots of the ugly alleyway</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mcyuyh2ylk25">social media sites like Twitter and BlueSky</a> as well as Reddit.</p>

 <p>Thankfully, the playerbase is already fixing the ugly lighting issues in <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/16">There’s already a mod</a> for the demo online that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qjuwsf/a_quick_original_filter_vs_no_filter_comparison/">apparently removes a visual filter RGG has implemented in the game and in other recent <em>Yakuza</em> titles.</a> And yeah, seeing the game both with and without the filter makes it clear that this isn’t an ugly game. Instead, it seems that the filter, as well as some shading issues, are causing it to look worse than the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> in some specific circumstances. Hopefully the devs add a toggle to remove the filter, but considering they are shipping <em>Kiwami 3</em> with an actor who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p>Everyone knew Forza Horizon 6 was finally getting its first gameplay reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. It’s fair to say expectations were high, as should be with such a class series—but Playground Games might have outdone themselves with FH6.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-setting-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6’s location</a> was revealed, it made sense. A ludicrously beautiful country with rich culture and a storied heritage. It’s a match made in heaven. Forza was always going to be the main highlight of the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, but its first gameplay footage went up another gear.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 Release Date was confirmed</a> hours before the 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. But that quickly became an afterthought once gameplay sped onto the screen.</p>







<p>On one hand, it looks like Forza Horizon, it’s Forza Horizon 5, baby! The visuals are out of this world, and there’s a ton of new modes, cars, and features being added.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself.</p>

<p>The tease in question was shared to Nintendo of America and LEGO socials, and sees <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/new-18plus-lego-mario-kart-set-is-a-better-build-than-we-expected">last year's Mario Kart set</a> geared up and ready to go before a mysterious figure emerges on the right side of the screen. It's far from a detailed look at the set, but the green cap, arm, and accompanying caption, "Racing runs in the family," all but confirm it.</p>

<p>Neither Nintendo nor LEGO has revealed any pricing information or a release date for the Luigi Mario Kart set just yet, but for reference, the Mario counterpart went up for £149.99 / $169.99 last year, so we'd be surprised if it's <em>much</em> more than that.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information down the line, but gosh, what a year to be a LEGO / Nintendo fan — and what a bad year to be money conscious...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pathways</span></i><span>, a “bespoke interactive learning” game developed in collaboration with the “political literacy” platform Shout Out UK and funded by the British government, has inadvertently spawned a “cute goth e-girl” meme. The game was meant to fight anti-immigrant extremism, but now its character has been turned into a pro-right-wing symbol.</span></p> <p><span>Developed by the Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire council in collaboration with Shout Out UK, </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is a barebones visual novel web game that puts you in the shoes of Charlie, a college-aged boy or girl who has a terrible habit of running into bizarre political radicalization scenarios. It’s </span><a href="https://www.shoutoutuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pathways-teachers-guide-extremism-youth-radicalisation.pdf"><span>being touted</span></a><span> as a tool that teachers can use to combat the “promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The "worst" ending btw <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amelia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Amelia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pathways?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pathways</a> <a href="https://t.co/v7kZ3N9oMi">pic.twitter.com/v7kZ3N9oMi</a></p> <p>— Bee CrayZee (@Bee_CrayZee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bee_CrayZee/status/2010603633826750834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The level-headed critique of </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is that its content and choices are sparse. The idea that a minute-long PowerPoint slideshow-style narrative could fully address extremism and radicalization is laughable, but the railroaded, overly domineering choices will doubtlessly also come off as ham-fisted to the same people it’s meant to reach.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, it’s the online right that’s propelled </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/amelia-pathways/"><span>into memedom</span></a><span>. The result has been the sudden influx of AI-generated “cute goth e-girl” fan-art (if you can call it “art”) in some corners of the internet, based on Amelia, </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>racist, yet alternatively-styled, antagonist.</span></p>

   <p><span>She’s exploded in popularity on alt-right leaning subreddits like r/Asmongold, who immediately saw a vision of </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/1qff3jv/authright_be_like/"><span>their perfect woman</span></a><span> in Amelia. As a result, the meme spread to X. Since then, users have been making </span><a href="https://searchlightmagazine.com/2026/01/how-purple-haired-cartoon-amelia-became-a-far-right-icon/"><span>Grok work overtime</span></a><span>, generating hundreds of Amelia images for the platform’s far-right crowd to enjoy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the blame here lies with whoever designed </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>artwork. Making a goth-adjacent female racist be the only character in your game with a distinctive design, and then having them become more attached to the protagonist if they choose to support anti-immigration ideas and policies, was certainly a choice. I can’t help but feel that whoever designed Amelia has clearly never met a teenager before. That being said, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1qfhs8y/british_government_isnt_even_trying_bro/"><span>Reze/Amelia meme</span></a><span> on the r/Chainsawfolk subreddit is very, very funny.</span></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/finally-a-new-controller-that-solves-the-switch-2s-flat-joy-con-problem/</link>
            <guid>1413394</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">reviewed the Switch 2 back in June</a>, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that “my Switch 2 will probably need something like <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-pro-purple-style-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;sscid=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388&amp;awc=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388">the Nyxi Hyperion Pro</a>, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">Hyperion 3</a>, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYXIGameOFFICIAL/videos/25434137766281969/">made available for preorder earlier this week</a> ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience.</p>
<p>While there are <a href="https://www.powera.com/p/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2/controllers/wireless/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0545-01/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;utm_campaign=gpmax-2025_Jun_6_gpmax-nsw2_smart_paid_sales_all_product&amp;gad_source=1">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/next-wireless-rechargeable-pro-controller-for-switch-2-switch-midnight/J3R4V77RLK/sku/6601305?utm_source=feed&amp;extStoreId=1129&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=20510845600&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20510847514">third-party controllers</a> for the Switch 2, none of the current options mimic the official Joy-Cons’ ability to connect magnetically to the console tablet itself (controllers designed to slide into the grooves on the original Switch tablet also can’t hook to the successor console). The Hyperion 3 is the first Switch 2 controller to offer this magnetic connection, making it uniquely suited for handheld play on the system.</p>
<p>And although I haven’t held the Hyperion 3 in my hands yet, my experience with the similar Hyperion 2 on the original Switch suggests that the ergonomic design here will be a welcome upgrade from the relatively small buttons and cramp-inducing flat back of the official Switch 2 Joy-Cons (“Say Goodbye to Tendonitis,” as Nyxi claims in its marketing materials). The controller can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth 5.0 for when you want to switch to docked play, unlike some Switch Joy-Con replacements that only work in portable mode.</p>

Developer Spiders announced today that its follow-up will launch on March 12.</p><p>Set three years before the original GreedFall, The Dying World is a choice-driven action RPG where players control a native of the island of Teer Fradee, the primary setting of the last game. The protagonist is a guardian of knowledge and nature; unfortunately, this status attracts the attention of colonists from the old continent of Gacane, which is being ravaged by the Malichor plague. The invaders capture the player and bring them to Gacane to be experimented on, so players must find a way to escape and return home. Along the way, they’ll get roped up in a grander conspiracy that may endanger everyone on Teer Fradee.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dialogue choices steer the game’s plot, as players can talk their way in and out of situations as well as build alliances, including assembling a party of companions.

			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">What won't be releasing with the update, but shortly after, is an overhaul of the networking solution for <em>Frosthaven</em>. With a variety of tests, the team has created a more stable online experience using Epic Online Services.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Legacy of the Algox</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The Legacy of the Algox story will follow the culture of the Algox and the warring between the two different clans of yeti-like creatures, the Snowspeakers and Icespeakers. "Both of these clans have their problems with each other, and you need to help them resolve these issues.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's decision-making from the side of the player on how to approach these problems. We used this to create replayability, as there are generally three ways to solve the problem, each with its own missions"</p><p dir="ltr">One of these decisions comes after Scenario 4 of the new campaign content, when you need to make a decision on which tribe you're siding with; whichever one you side with, you'll unlock that class as a playable one. The spoiler-free names for these classes are Snowflake and Fist.</p><p dir="ltr">For anyone worried about missing out on a character, Petkov immediately followed up to explain, "At the end of this campaign, you unlock the other class."</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of campaign content, this update is also bringing with it "a lot of new stuff. New side scenarios, items, and so on."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's </em>Infuser Is Powerful But Has A Learning Curve</h2><p dir="ltr">Getting to see one of the new classes getting added to the game, we jumped into a scenario with the Infuser as one of our party members. "The Infuser has persistent effects that stay for the whole battle. When she plays an infusion, it has a persistent effect and a trigger effect.</p><p dir="ltr">"The trigger effect triggers when you play it for the first time, but triggers every time you play a new infusion. If you play one of these effects, for example, 'Attack for 3,' but you play a second infusion that heals it, it also triggers the attack of the previous one. If you play a third infusion, it will activate itself and the previous two."</p><p dir="ltr">The important part of playing this class is learning the different combo effects that you can begin to chain together, and how to best layer those effects over one another.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Player Feedback for Better or Worse</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout our discussion, one of the topics that continued to be highlighted was just how much the team at Snapshot Games was paying attention to their fanbase. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7063e8-3c90-48be-a660-2a7afffa5e50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">From playing it last year at SGF to today</a>, I could see how much added polish there was in the game. Petkov also highlighted a number of UI changes that had been made, and that there were still hundreds of icon improvements they had yet to implement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">A constant theme of our discussion was all of the little ways that the game had been shaped with the input of the community. I was interested to learn how the team balances those community requests alongside the standard development roadmap, and when the community might be asking too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov explained that they thought about these in a few categories. The first of which is when something is technically broken, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mechanic doesn't work as it does in the board game</a>. In this case, "the community is right, they are the board game fans. They do want things to happen similarly, so the tricky part is to implement what they want without making the game extremely tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Some examples of tedium that he brought up were players who want more control over the game, being allowed to move the enemies or calculate their AI, "but if we do that, the game will interrupt you all the time. Especially in multiplayer, this would be terrible."</p><p dir="ltr">An example of UI optimization that the team is working on for a future patch is how to reduce UI pop-ups when returning to the outpost and how to make sure what's contained on the screen is the distilled information necessary to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">"In some cases, our answer is obviously no."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I explained it multiple times to multiple players, but it's still getting asked."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">What's important from the team at Snapshot Games is that they're communicative about their decisions as the game is continuing to be developed to make sure, even if the community might disagree at times, that they understand why.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-07.jpg?itok=efhl-aX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I nodded in agreement with their desire for clear communication. "If the community is made aware, then they would understand and not make a big deal out of it."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a momentary pause before Petkov responded, "Ahhh, yeah, but that's not always happening."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the bigger problems we're having, and I have no solution for it, is people playing the board game wrong. Playing digitally, they think the game is bugged when it's not. Recently, we had a negative review, a person said they would change their review to be positive if you fix&nbsp;this card," Petkov said.</p><p dir="ltr">"The card is actually absolutely correctly implemented. It's a problematic card, and people playing the board game don't understand how it works, but we implemented it correctly, according to Isaac Childres and everyone, but we got downvoted because people don't know the rules."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov took a moment to thank the active members of the community who are helping them convey corrections in these kinds of situations.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Puzzle Book Will Keep You On Track</h2><p dir="ltr">In the board game, Petkov advised that "the Puzzle Book is very polarizing because it's interesting as a side thing, but in the board game, it's locking you out of game progression. What we did is we kept a lot of the story it has and the requirements, but we made it in the form of a main quest."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"The Puzzle Book is now leading your way, instead of locking your way."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the Puzzle Book, for each page you reach, you'll get a checklist of scenarios to complete to gather the relevant information to solve the puzzle. If you're ever not sure what to do next, you can use the Puzzle Book as a way to prompt yourself forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, a Solve button has also been added for each of the Puzzle Book's pages. The team understands that if you're invested in the gameplay, the puzzles available in the Puzzle Book might not be your thing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All Kinds Of Future Expansion Ideas Are Brewing</h2><p dir="ltr">Continuing the idea that people might play the game differently at home, the team at Snapshot Games is also looking at ways to implement different house rules, like being able to pool resources.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a variety of other game mode alterations that have been getting tested internally to appeal to a different kind of player. It's not entirely certain whether these will officially see the light of day, but I was fascinated to hear of the different testing going on.</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ece340c588e691efd54abcceb0920b6a3">For new players, a mode was tested where two cards are selected for you automatically. This limits player options, but also lets players focus on a smaller number of cards when they're starting, which should speed up their entry into the game.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ee2def30d192d0b679404d100e4ab5d7f">For players who enjoy the strategy game, but not so much the resource management and city building segments, a mode has been investigated where the city will automatically get built in an efficient manner, leaving the player to not have to worry.</li></ul><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-01.jpg?itok=XoxOkxqP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven </em>Progress From Table To Screen</h2><p dir="ltr">The most exciting idea that I heard about from Petkov was that they're investigating making a save game creator. This wouldn't just be a way to give yourself access to all of the resources you need or unlock characters early, but instead would be a way that you could 'convert' your physical game status to the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">An example was given of a group of players who live further apart, so can only play in person once a month. If they could 'import' their physical save into the game, then they could play remotely at different times, and then when they get back together to play physically, they can 'export' their progress back to their dining room table.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the players are playing this board game for a couple of years, and they haven't finished it. They don't want to spoil themselves with the board game, but if they could do both, then that would be amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is something we'll definitely do for the final release."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's Legacy Of The Algox</em> update will be launching on Steam and the Epic Game Store on January 22. With the next update expected in April, it won't be too much longer until the game is fully released.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frosthavens-new-expansion-brings-playable-characters-missions-and-fan-suggested]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Out today in early access, Turnbound is a tile and turn-based autobattler about mythical heroes trapped in a haunted boardgame, where the starting player is chosen by flipping a coin bearing a picture of a cat’s anus. It’s saying a lot for Turnbound’s mellow, fairytale ambience and rich, rosy tile designs that I consider the cat’s anus a positive – a touch of whimsy, rather than just, well, that feeling you get when you’ve been flashbanged by a picture of a cat’s anus. Rare indeed are the videogames that contain a cat’s anus, and rarer still are the videogames in which the cat’s anus isn’t grounds for a refund.

<p>
Look, shut up about the cat’s anus already. You’re obsessed with the cat’s anus. There’s so much more to Turnbound than this. To start afresh: the story is that you’ve been trapped in a haunted boardgame. To get out, you must choose a hero – the current choices are Robin Hood, Sun Wukong the Monkey King, and Lewis Caroll’s Alice - and surround them with tiles that perform attacks, confer protection, or synergise with other tiles. Then you autobattle other players and heroes over 10 rounds. The twist is that some/all of these opposing boards are the work of other players, snuck into your game via Ye Olde Asynchronous Online (or a build code, if you prefer). 
</p>
<p>
Between rounds, there’s a shop screen where you can buy new tiles, level them up, and unlock squares on your board. At fixed points in each run, you’ll get opportunities to upgrade your hero and equip trinkets, which gives the proceedings some additional structure. The Steam page summarises it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-battles">Backpack Battles</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> Battlegrounds meets the age-old practice of ‘inventory Tetris’. I think that’s a fair breakdown, after half an hour with the early access version.
</p><p>
During battles, tiles attack or activate according to placement and what they’re adjacent to. There are ‘taunt’ tiles to absorb the enemy’s best tricks, accessory tiles that confer status effects, reactive tiles that heal or generate coins when they’re meddled with, and much else besides. Heroes have different capacities. To give a hasty summary, Sun Wukong is good at chain attacks, Alice puts people to sleep while buffing herself through curious and curioser means, and Robin Hood is a counterpuncher.
</p>
<p>
It’s too early for me to seriously gauge the tactical depth, here, but it feels like this could have legs. In the short term, what elevates Turnbound is the presentation. True, the art is broadly the kind of medium-spice anime-fantasy malarkey you’ve encountered in any number of mobile fantasy games, but it doesn’t want for charisma. Run the cursor over tiles in the shop screen and they tinkle lovingly. Spare tiles pile up in a bag that is subject to real-time physics. And yes, there is the coin with the cat’s anus. Again, the cat’s anus is a plus. I was going to say I’m giving it a thumbs-up, but no, that would be bad.
</p>
<p>
The full game will offer “more characters, more skins, and hundreds more Items and Abilities”. Developers 1TK aren’t committing to a 1.0 launch date, but are giving a rough timeline of “4-6 months”. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3802470/Turnbound/">Read more on Steam</a>.
