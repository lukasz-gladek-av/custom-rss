Executive producer Scott Junior said each major update will be free and include new story and PvE content. These updates will be released alongside the game's paid DLCs, which can be bought standalone or together as part of the game's season pass.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Junior additionally mentioned Dune: Awakening will receive new PvE maps for players to explore in the future, though it's unclear if these would be included for free as a major update or come in the form of a paid expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the more immediate future, Junior said an update is coming in early July that will contain "too many" quality-of-life changes to list. Junior didn't go into detail on what those changes would be, but said to expect the patch notes when the patch is closer to being ready for testing.</p><p dir="ltr">Funcom dove into plenty of other topics as part of the AMA, ranging from plans to make it so players can name storage containers and vehicles to its thoughts on potential changes to Dune: Awakening's PvP-focused endgame. Many of players' complaints are focused around the heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a> in the game's endgame Deep Desert zone, so much so that PvP encounters are largely between flying Ornithopters rather than on-foot encounters where the game's melee and firearms can come into play. When asked about the potential of a Deep Desert zone where only ground vehicles would be allowed, creative director Joel Bylos shot down the idea but did say Funcom is looking to make some changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this," Bylos said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions players can expect in Dune: Awakening's future based on Funcom's Reddit answers include an option to duel other players, a deposit all option for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water-in-dune-awakening/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">water</a>, changes to the endgame PvE Landsraad system, additional contracts to complete, and a third faction that "will change the entire dynamic" of the Landsraad, according to Bylos.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is finding major success on Steam, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-the-lisan-al-gaib-of-dune-games-as-steam-concurrents-top-140000/1100-6532344/" data-ref-id="1100-6532344">surpassed 140,000 concurrent players</a>. Its most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">update addressed some of its endgame PvP problems</a> by making it so vehicles no longer deal damage when colliding with other players, as well as increased respawn timers in PvP zones. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">Dune: Awakening is still slated to launch on consoles</a>, but not until 2026.</p>

The premiere 2025 title from Capcom has seen recent user reviews on Steam decline into the "overwhelmingly negative" range, and more players are currently playing an older game from the series, Monster Hunter World.</p><p>Monster Hunter World is currently hosting over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/582010/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">16,000 concurrent players</a>. Wilds, in comparison, has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10,000 concurrent players</a> right now. World has been pulling in a peak of at least 25,000 players each day this week while Wilds has not broken the 23,000 player mark in that same period. Fans of the series are going back to World after being disappointed by the endgame content and performance issues in Wilds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Players have been sounding off about Monster Hunter Wilds' performance issues and other problems via Steam's review system. Many of the reviews cite frame rate issues, an unsatisfactory story, not enough endgame content, and a few go as far to say the game will no longer start on their computers.</p><p>Capcom brought new content to Monster Hunter World for two years after it was released. While it did have some performance issues, players never criticized the game as harshly on Steam. Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled to be part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-will-show-off-more-of-resident-evil-requiem-in-a-showcase-next-week/1100-6532567/" data-ref-id="1100-6532567">Capcom Spotlight</a> showcase stream next week where the publisher will show off an upcoming update. Players are hoping for some big additions to endgame content and upgrades to how the game runs on PC.</p><p>"Capcom understands the value of throwing you into one climactic battle after another in what would be a set-piece boss fight in almost any other game," Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpots Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> at the beginning of 2024. "Monster Hunter Wilds suffers from some performance issues, the environments are often bland, and the story feels superfluous, but when you're face-to-face with a fearsome monster, few situations are quite as riveting. Monster Hunter Wilds may only make iterative improvements to further refine the formula, but that's all it really needed to do."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It’s summer gaming showcase season, and the minds behind Little Nightmares are getting in on the fun by announcing a dedicated presentation for the franchise. The Little Nightmares Showcase has been revealed for next week and will likely have an update on the upcoming third entry.</p><p>All we know about the showcase for now is that it airs on June 24 at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET. The news was shared by the Little Nightmares III <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">X account</a>, with a post stating,</p><p>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think.</p><p>Are you ready to face it, little ones?&nbsp;</p><p>One would imagine the presentation will heavily revolve around Little Nightmares III, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2023/2023/08/23/little-nightmares-3-announced-for-2024-release-developed-by-until-dawn">first announced</a> at Gamescom 2023. Supermassive Games is developing the title, replacing the original creators, Tarsier Studios, which is currently working on a new horror platformer, <a href="https://youtu.be/mUymvhAXOnM?si=8nr9ft1tikkJkT9t">Reanimal</a>. Little Nightmares III was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/31/little-nightmares-iii-moves-into-2025">delayed to 2025</a> last year and has no concrete release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s also plausible we’ll learn concrete details for the long-rumored Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition. Though technically unannounced, the game’s existence <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/12/esrb-rates-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">first came to light</a> in late 2023 after it received a rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in South Africa. Much like the Enhanced Edition for Little Nightmares II that released in 2021 (also developed by Supermassive), this would presumably be a new-gen remaster of the 2017 original game.</p><p>Whether we get a Little Nightmares III release date or confirmation for the Enhanced Edition of the first title, we don’t have to wait long to find out either way. &nbsp;Until then, you can brush up on Little Nightmares III by checking out 18 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/check-out-18-minutes-of-unsettling-little-nightmares-3-co-op-gameplay">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope or expect to see during the Little Nightmares Showcase? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game developer Ruled are onto a nice little spree with their shortform Itch.io releases - seemingly, they are skipping from phobia to phobia. First there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/automatonophobia">Automatonophobia</a>, a game that navigated the fear of subterranean golems, then there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/chrometophobia">Chrometophobia</a>, a game dedicated to the fear of spending money, and also to the act of finding "grimbo" gibs for a delicious pie. What's next on the menu? Ah yes, scarecrows. </p><!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/formidophobia">Formidophobia</a>, which can be downloaded for free, you are a farmer trying to make it across a hazy lofi cornfield. Your dad told you never to go in that field. His dad told him never to go in that field. Neither of them are around anymore, however, and your wife needs medical attention, so off you trot with your bolt-action rifle and exactly one shell. With luck, you'll find more shells along the way.</p>
<p>The rifle is a stubborn, slothful broomhandle of a weapon that wobbles drunkenly at stomach level and often gets caught on other objects, dragging behind you in a way that makes me empathise for the weary arms of my character. The principal challenge and source of dread in Formidophobia is reloading it in a punctual fashion.</p>
<p>The starting area is a ring of scrawly signposts that illustrate the process of pulling back the lever, tugging a shell from the holder, and closing the gun up again. The utility of those signposts isn't that they tell you how to wield your gun, in my experience - it's that other things can't walk through them.</p>
<p>I enjoy the grubbiness, stodginess and overall inhospitability of this game. Don't come expecting "polish", do come expecting a briskly unpleasant meditation on the rasp of stems and the crickle-crackle of bones, deep in the mist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/three-weeks-in-elden-ring-nightreign-players-are-inventing-some-creative-ways-to-skip-around-the-map<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been roughly three weeks since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> dropped on May 30, and players have started to get their heads around all the different tools and abilities available to them in Limveld. What some are starting to do with those abilities, though, is pretty fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the top posts on the r/Nightreign subreddit this morning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg0on3/new_strategy_for_getting_to_noklateo_quicker/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was from user u/Quantam-Law</a>, who was playing with a Raider under the username "BRO....". BRO had a pretty great idea: the trio of Nightfarers had the Noklateo Shifting Earth event, and rather than storm the front gate of the city, BRO popped Raider's ultimate to provide a new platform for entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Noklateo, and other Shifting Earth events, are random, map-changing alterations that can appear, adding new encounters and areas to explore in the process. But while this usage of Totem Stela is good for that, it gets the gears turning on other places and ways you could use the massive brick to get up and around designed obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raider's not the only one with tricks, either. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfvzuf/crater_wylder_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Mockz_ also had a recent skip posted</a> up on the Elden Ring Nightreign subreddit, this time for the Crater Shifting Earth event. In this one, Mockz uses their abilities, and a little bit of good ol' fashioned gravity to get where they need to go, at the bottom of the Crater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another user, u/ninjabladeJr, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfox8v/consistent_crater_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a feasible</a>—albeit challenging and dangerous—skip of their own to the bottom of the Crater, using a spectral hawk and specific line-ups. Are these Crater skips dangerous? Absolutely. Is it awesome to see someone breeze past the many, many encounters of the dungeon and straight to the big boss, the ultimate goal and prize of the Shifting Earth event? You betcha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, there are people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l691iv/mountaintop_event_skip_to_save_you_some_time/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even finding ways to the top of the Mountaintop event</a> by just Skyrim-jumping their way up the side of the cliffs like an ibex. Shifting Earth events are a fun, fascinating part of Nightreign's construction and layout, and it's amazing how players are already finding ways to navigate them faster and smarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual usability of these is absolutely up-in-the-air. I could see popping the Noklateo totem-skip in a random lobby, but I think attempting the spectral hawk Crater skip in a room with two random players who don't know what I'm doing is a fast path to two, if not three, Nightfarers down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the fact players are getting so creative with their abilities and finding such interesting uses for them bodes well for the long-term health of Elden Ring Nightreign. As of this writing, the speedrun leaderboards for Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Elden_Ring_Nightreign/news/mxl4856p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still aren't live</a>, but these community-discovered skips already have me intrigued to see what speedrunners can showcase with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Chapter 5 is currently set for a 2026 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information was revealed in the end credits of Deltarune Chapter 4, which released alongside Chapter 3 earlier this month. No further specificity about dates or windows was given.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/deltarune-ch-5-1750433683939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune is a "sequel" of sorts to beloved indie RPG Undertale, and has released chapter by chapter starting in 2018, with Chapter 2 releasing in 2021 and the two most recent chapters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">dropping alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this month</a>. The game follows a human named Kris who lives in a peaceful town of monsters familiar to those who played Undertale. Together with the school bully Suzie, they fall into a mysterious "Dark World" and meet a prince named Ralsei, who charges them with saving both the dark and light world by sealing dark fountains. Each chapter tackles a different dark fountain in something like a "monster of the week" format, though Chapter 4 goes off the rails a bit in exploring the game's overarching meta-plot that fans speculate may eventually tie the game back to Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapters 1 and 2 are available on all major platforms for free, while the full game including Chapters 3, 4, and all future chapters (up to at least seven) costs $25. With the paid release, we reviewed all of Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that "its incredible and well-refined culmination of captivating characters, hilarious and earnest writing, and stellar music has already left one hell of a lasting impact I’m not likely to forget."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Those who've played <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/now-pac-man-can-run-into-the-ghosts-behold-the-new-championship-edition-2/">the excellent <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em> series</a> will be familiar with the high-speed vibe here, but <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> remains focused on the game's original maze and selection of just four ghosts. That means old-school strategies for grouping ghosts together and running successful patterns through the narrow corridors work in similar ways here. Successfully executing those patterns becomes a tense battle of nerves here, though, requiring multiple direction changes every second at the highest speeds. While the game will technically work with swipe controls on a smartphone or tablet, high-level play really requires the precision of a keyboard via a desktop/laptop web browser (we couldn't get the game to recognize a USB controller, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As exciting as the high-speed maze gameplay gets, though, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is hampered by a few odd design decisions. The game ends abruptly after just 13 levels, for instance, making it impossible to even attempt the high-endurance 256-level runs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/billy-mitchell-says-hes-not-going-to-stop-now-after-scoreboard-ban/">that <em>Pac-Man</em> is known for</a>. The game also throws an extra life at you every 5,000 points, making it relatively easy to brute force your way to the end as long as you focus on the three increasingly high-point-value items that appear periodically on each stage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the game doesn't give any point reward for unused extra lives or long-term survival at high speeds, limiting the rewards for high-level play. And the lack of a built-in leaderboard makes it hard to directly compare your performance to friends and/or strangers anyway.</p>

<p>Those issues aside, I've had a blast coming back to <em>Pac-Man Supefast</em> over and over again in the past few days, slowly raising my high score above the 162,000 point mark during coffee breaks (consider the gauntlet thrown, Ars readers). If you're a fan of classic arcade games, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is worth a try before the "YouTube Playables" initiative inevitably joins <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/">the growing graveyard of discontinued Google products</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-i-never-felt-true-nostalgia-until-i-played-gamecube-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="GameCube 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/132905828a6e7/gamecube-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I still remember the day I got my GameCube. It wasn’t the launch day, because I remember getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> alongside it, which to my knowledge released a few weeks after the console itself in the UK.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, I was so excited though! I poured over early issues of <a href="https://www.nintendomags.com/magazines/ngc-magazine/">NGC</a> in the weeks leading up to The Big Day (somehow, there were already about six or seven issues before the console even released), perhaps most notably while on a family holiday in Cyprus, clutching the magazine while my Mum tried to get me to focus on the sights and sounds of the Limassol coastline. <em>No Mum… I’m reading about Link’s Melee moveset for the hundredth time, thanks.</em></p><p><figure data-videoid="QmxeKH0YIR0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmxeKH0YIR0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The day I actually got the GameCube felt so magical; previously, my brother’s Mega Drive and PS1 had been passed down to me while he moved onto the next big thing, and I had already owned a Game Boy Color by this point thanks to the <strong>Pokémon</strong> boom, but the GameCube was the first home console that I could truly call my own. It was <em>mine</em>. My precious.</p>
<p>The three or four years following were some of the most memorable of my life; really up until the release of the Wii, if I’m honest. And it’s because the GameCube launched right when I was starting to find my feet at high school, and so the friendships I cultivated during that time linked directly with my experience with the console.</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db266839ba078/gamecube-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had two ‘best friends’, I guess you could call them, and they both owned their own GameCubes and were just about as passionate as I was about Nintendo’s adorable little purple box – perhaps more so, actually. So we played multiplayer as often as we could, and when we weren’t playing together, we’d be talking about our own experiences in between classes (and yes, probably during classes too).</p>
<p><em>“How does Link control?”</em> is an actual question I specifically remember asking one of my friends after he’d got his hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> six or seven hours before me. He got his delivery before school started that day, and I had to wait until I got home the same evening. Ridiculous! But it was these kinds of conversations that really got me through high school. I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p>Life goes on, of course, and for reasons I can’t quite recall, I had to get rid of my GameCube and accompanying games. High school and college ended, and so my friends and I went our separate ways when university hit, chasing our own visions of what adulthood might look like. Outside of a few brief chance encounters in the years since, we’d pretty much remained apart for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>However, after another encounter a couple of years back, I’ve reconnected with those same two friends I’d spent so much time with during high school. Now, on a near-weekly basis, we get together at a local micro pub, knock back a couple of pints, munch on some pork scratchings, and spend each Saturday evening enjoying rousing discussions about current affairs, gaming, and of course, our time together at high school.</p>
<p>The best thing about these little get-togethers is the joint realisation that none of us has really changed. Sure, we’ve changed in the obvious sense that we’re now grown up with lots of different responsibilities and whatnot, but we still all love gaming, and it genuinely felt like our time apart after high school just never happened. It was like we were right back in 2002, albeit without the constant threat of bullies and the monotonous homework. I had a real rough time in 2023 for reasons I won’t go into here, and honestly, reconnecting with my two best friends again saved me.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and our conversations frequently involve the Switch 2. We’d go over our hopes for the console, rumours and speculation, along with any information that Nintendo itself had officially announced. Naturally, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">the big Direct</a> happened at the start of April and included confirmation that GameCube games would be making a comeback, this became a hot topic for the three of us. Not only was the console that effectively cemented our friendships back in 2002 suddenly a thing again, but the fact that it was happening <em>now</em>, after so many years of us being apart, felt remarkably significant.</p>

<p>So I have to admit, booting up the GameCube app on Switch 2 for the first time, official wireless GameCube controller at hand, I felt a little bit emotional. I've had that nostalgic feeling plenty of times – haven't we all?-- but nothing quite like this. Hauling myself down that ladder and taking my first steps across Outset Island in The Wind Waker immediately brought back memories of that ridiculous question I'd asked my friend all those years back.</p>
<p>But instead of it festering in the back of my mind, I know I can bring it up with the exact same friend at the pub, and I know it'll lead to a dozen other GameCube memories and unrestrained belly laughs. That's just how it is. And it's the same with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>: all three games played a huge part in our teenage years, and so they all hold their own respective treasure troves of memories within.</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing missing right now. The game that started it all, the one I poured over for countless hours in NGC magazines, and the one I played the first time I booted up my GameCube in 2002: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>.</p>
<p>It's yet to be confirmed for Nintendo Switch Online, but if/when it does, I imagine our nights out at the pub will turn into impromptu Melee tournaments. And I can't wait.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, is officially out, and in just the game's first 24 hours of being live for everyone, not just those who paid for early access a few days ahead of launch, <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553">Sloclap announced</a> that Rematch had&nbsp;<strong>1 million unique players</strong> running on to the pitch.</p>
<p>It's great news for Sloclap, but what was better news for players was Sloclap pushing a new hotfix for Rematch, which can be downloaded now on all platforms. Patch 0.5 adds a bug fix for the ball hitting the post and going out of sync with other players, though still notes that ball sync issues "<em>might still happen under other circumstances</em>."</p>
<p>And most importantly, this new hotfix includes fixes for stability issues, netcode improvements, and matchmaking updates to improve queue times.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's been a great launch for Rematch, with more than 1 million unique players, and on Steam alone, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">92,841 concurrent players</a>. On the other hand, it's been fraught with bugs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lg6j0f/please_consolidate_all_na_servers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long queue times</a>, and Sloclap has already <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">talked about its priorities</a> when it comes to making more fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Crossplay support is at the top of the list, as it was just hours before the game released in its early access launch for the players who paid extra, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support would not be in the game at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap has apologized for not telling players that crossplay would be missing sooner, and hopefully, it's not too long of a wait for the feature to be added.</p>

You’ve got some work to do if you’re looking to get your system exactly the way you want it out of the box. But we have come to you from the other side of the chaos with a few things you should know before the Switching hour. </p><h2 id="h249277"><a id="1"></a>Make the system remember you</h2><p>Probably not a surprise that you’re gonna be signing into your Nintendo Account a LOT during the initial setup. But while the sign in screen conveniently gives you a QR code so you can sign in on your phone instead of doing the on-screen keyboard cabaret, it’s easy to ignore <strong>the fact that the Switch 2 screen has a little button onscreen to remember you</strong>. That button is not hit by default, so while you’re working on signing in, you might just guarantee that you’re gonna see this screen again in the very near future (it’ll come up again when you sign into the eShop for the first time, but that’s about it). Save yourself some annoyance, click that button on the Switch before you go to your phone.</p><h2 id="h249278"><a id="2"></a>Do System Transfer before anything else</h2><p>It’s tempting to want to just slap the thing on your dock and get started as soon as possible. If this is, somehow, your first Switch, knock yourself out. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">if you’re planning on transferring data from your old Switch</a></span> to the new one, pump your brakes a sec. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-cloud-local-initial-1851784644?rev=1750174943328">The Nintendo Switch 2’s System Transfer Is Great If You Do It Correctly</a></span></p><p>The transfer process will throw up a message to connect the Switch to an AC adapter before starting. And they’re not asking, they’re telling. The popup will happen again and the process literally won’t be able to start until the Switch determines there’s enough power flowing into it. </p><p>For us homebodies that prefer to do their Switchery on TV instead of handheld, that’s fine for the system you’ve got docked. But then <strong>you’ll have to have your original Switch doing the same thing in its transfer menu, and it needs to be in close proximity of the Switch 2. </strong>Furthermore, whatever the Switch 2's power demands are, 2 plain old USB-C chargers won’t do the job, either. It’s recommended to use the charger that came with the Switch 2 itself, i.e., the one you fucked up and plugged into your dock. If you’re a super fancy dual-handheld household, I personally managed to skate past it using my Steam Deck’s charger, but not everybody’s got that option. Once that’s done, though,<strong> both systems must remain in close proximity for the actual data transfer</strong>, which thankfully only took about 5 minutes. Basically, don’t go docking until that’s done.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the Switch 2's kinda like an iPhone, <strong>you’ll only get the option to transfer your old data during the initial setup process</strong>. If you go to the main menu, you’ll have to factory reset the Switch 2 to do the transfer later.</p><h2 id="h249279"><a id="3"></a>Can’t use System Transfer? Use Nintendo’s website instead</h2><figure id="" data-id="7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-recommend-id="image://7ac4a57476ef884916b3f569b41c6907" data-format="png" data-width="692" data-height="381" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the user's original Switch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>On the flipside, if you want access to your old stuff but don’t have access to your original Switch, you can at least do so from Nintendo’s site. Logic and common sense dictates that if you buy a game from a digital storefront, the game is tied to your account, and as long as you sign into your account, they’ll follow you anywhere. Nintendo, however, is not a logical company. <strong>As it turns out, while games will show up on your account, they’re actually tied to a specific console. System Transfer takes care of linking the games to your Switch 2 for you, but if that’s not an option, there is an alternative.</strong></p><p>Go to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://accounts.nintendo.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://accounts.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts.nintendo.com</a></span>, and you’ll see a section for Game Systems. Click that, then select your original Switch. You’ll see a bar marked “Loadable”. Click that and unlink that system. Now, whenever you go to download anything from your library, it’ll link it to the new system.</p></div><h2 id="h249280"><a id="4"></a>You can have 4k or 120hz; you can’t have both</h2><figure id="" data-id="7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-recommend-id="image://7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-recommend-id="image://7e16c7b826b32a7d33f8839eac4564fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows display options for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those lucky folks with fancier 4K TVs might’ve gotten excited to find out the new Switch supports 4K and 120hz modes, and then been dumbfounded when the Display Options only showed 60fps.

Basically, though, you’re not missing anything, really. </p><p>Oh and also, the same goes for VRR, which is only supported in handheld mode.</p></div><h2 id="h249281"><a id="5"></a>Turn on Auto Uploads for the Switch Online App</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-recommend-id="image://fd2f8354521baf2b7f79b486cf03a2e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2's upload settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good news! The Switch Online app is actually extremely useful with the Switch 2, and not just for the most convoluted voice chat ever. One of the big improvements is that Nintendo’s joined the rest of the pack this console generation and included a feature where screenshots get uploaded to a centralized location to be accessed off of your system. Excellent news, but they also kinda bury the lede that you need to actually turn that feature on from the Switch 2 to make it happen. The option’s in the Upload Settings menu in the Album app. </p><h2 id="h249282"><a id="6"></a>Clearing up the controller conundrum</h2><figure id="" data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-recommend-id="image://45f6d5f9c4c07fd7f09e0d22786d5a4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows controller options on the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given how many different control configurations there are for the original Switch, adding a brand new set of options into the mix hasn’t made staying sane any easier for folks with a half dozen Joy-Cons running around.

Some publishers have been issuing firmware updates to allow their equipment to work, however.

      </div>
<p>Pocketpair has said that players will be able to "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria" as if they were any other creature from Palworld. Palworld is currently on sale for 25% off its full price on both Steam and the PlayStation Store.</p><p>Palworld hasn't had any other crossovers since it launched at the beginning of 2024. Terraria is one of the more popular games that Pocketpair could have partnered with for this update. The sandbox adventure game launched in 2011 and still has over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam 14 years later.</p><p>Palworld has also been in the midst of a lawsuit filed by Nintendo for allegedly infringing on its patents for gameplay. Palworld has made several changes to its game, including removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pal Spheres. More gameplay and artistic changes are expected to come as legal proceedings continue.</p>

<p>What a blast</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man</a>, the incredible action-platformer from developer DeadToast Entertainment, has received a generous new DLC expansion for absolutely free.</p>
<p>Inspired by DeadToast's previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/my_friend_pedro">My Friend Pedro</a>, the new levels will feature the signature 'bullet time' slow motion gameplay that made the game such a unique, memorable experience. Oh, and there's also skateboarding involved, too. How cool!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilize the power of sick moves and slow motion to battle and backflip your way through this hefty heap of challenging new stages, and face off against a selection of three fearsome and strangely familiar bosses.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"You can also enjoy a shotgun blast of new Pedro-inspired gameplay including acrobatic slow-motion, skateboarding, breakable windows, swing ropes, frying pans and zip-lines."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-sales-top-3m-worldwide-following-dlc-release.1224153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has announced that its puppet-centered Soulslike has reached a brand new sales milestone, just a handful of days after the release of its first big story DLC.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the action RPG, which launched back in 2023, has reached three million sales. That means it's picked up another two million for itself since launch month, during which it managed to achieve the impressive milestone of a million copies sold.</p>

<p>It's likely that the shadowdrop of&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, the game's first story expansion, helped sales along; it was launched without preceding fanfare during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">main Summer Game Fest show</a> earlier this month, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow">teased</a> by Neowiz for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">some time</a> prior to that announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=Y7qonlF9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=idEhKMsX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a new sales milestone, perhaps driven by the release of its first major DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG created by Korean studio Neowiz. As you've probably guessed, it's an extremely loose adaptation of 1883 children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, although the emphasis here is on "loose"; if you're expecting a faithful retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic fable, you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Instead, you're getting a fairly straightforward Soulslike setup; the city of Krat, a Belle Epoque-era metropolis full of breathtaking architecture, is now sadly also full of murderous puppets, and it's up to you, a different kind of murderous puppet, to do something about that.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>hews pretty close to the formula; it's built around parry-focused combat, semi-linear exploration, and an oblique story that drip-feeds clues over the course of the game's running time.</p>

<p>The game's first major DLC,&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, revolves around a legendary figure in&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s mythology by the name of Lea Florence Monad. You'll uncover her story while also exploring new areas, battling new enemies, and trying out some new weapons into the bargain.</p>




<p><em>Lies of P</em>&nbsp;is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available on all of those platforms.</p>

            <p>While the prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> turning out to be a real thing had folks wondering what that might mean for Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">release</a>, Bethesda were quick quell fears of a shutdown.</p>
<p>Both sides have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">openly chummy</a> since that point, with the studio behind The Elder Scrolls even having the team of modders pop by for a visit around the time their project was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-so-chill-about-skyblivion-that-theyre-promoting-it-in-oblivion-remastered-videos">shouted out on the official channels</a>. We've now learned a bit more about how that social call went and what the two sides chatted about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/we-just-kept-geeking-out-skyblivion-devs-were-invited-to-bethesda-hq-and-ended-up-spending-the-whole-day-talking-about-modding-with-the-team-and-todd-howard/">PC Gamer</a>, Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel revealed that the studio visit came about because he'd been planning a trip to the US around PAX East, and decided that since he was going to be in the area, he'd ring up Bethesda and see if they'd mind Skyblivion folks popping in.</p>
<p>Cue a day at ToddCo HQ that the modder recalled ran from 11AM until 6PM, with Bethesda's devs and Todd Howard himself chatting to the Skyblivion folks about their work. Naturally, it sounds like the studio's devs were curious about how the modders have found building their own interpretation of Oblivion using <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s tools, with Rebel saying that "how we experienced using those tools, what kind of issues we run into, and what we'd like to see in terms of documentation" were all big talking points.</p>
<p>As for the feedback the Skyblivion folks offered, the project lead said he kindly asked Bethesda to consider bringing back the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKivlGmia4">official creation kit tutorial video series</a> it released on YouTube when Skyrim got its tools. If you've not watched these vids, they're basically short how-tos narrated by different Bethesda devs that explain the ins-and-outs of the modding process.</p>
<p>A way to get started with Skyrim modding using the CK by making a basic dungeon, if - as I was when I used these videos for exactly that last year - you don't know your bum from your elbow when it comes to actually making mods or the navigating the practicalities of game development.</p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of good tutorials you can find if you're looking to get into modding more recent Bethesda games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, with some even being by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k9iRuLqwoY">high-profile modders</a>, but it's cool to have the devs who made the thing you've been playing talk you through the tools they used to do so. They're pretty good teachers, and it gives you an extra level of appreciation the next time you delve into one of Skyrim's dungeons. You'll know just how much work went to ensuring the enemies don't all get stuck on the same rock and eliminating void-leaking gaps in the ceiling, and it'll be good for your soul.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood-message">Blood Message</a> is a new singleplayer third-person action game from NetEase, publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/naraka-bladepoint">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>. It follows the journey of a “nameless messenger” and his son across Tang dynasty China, and is laced with the “customs, culture, and rich history of the era”. Amongst other sights and sounds, you will join an uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang and tread the legendary Silk Road trade routes as you “etch a final tale of loyalty” into the helpless, screaming face of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>I know absolutely nothing about any of these historical and cultural precedents, so I will frame things in terms of the mechanics and skits I recognise from opulent manly bonkfests like God Of War. You will: shimmy through narrow gaps, presumably so that the next area has time to load! Lift a huge sliding door so that your AI-controlled partner can scamper under it, bookending your progress! Mash somebody’s mug into the woodwork while performing an environmental finisher! Topple over and slide uncontrollably through collapsing scenery! Remorselessly QTE a cartwheel while trapped beneath the speeding vehicle! There, now - between those two paragraphs, you don’t even <em>need</em> to watch the following trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's end-of-day Friday and I am probably being too pissy. Yes, this appears to be another vibrantly violent canyon of exploding or murdersome photoreal furniture, but there is a lot of (romanticised?) history here I wouldn’t mind encountering up close.</p>
<p>I just hope it manages to have a sense of humour about itself, somewhere. NetEase don’t give that impression in their announcement release. “How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history?” it brays. “The Blood Message development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.” Nice to hear, because the monuments in the trailer don’t seem very eternal: it’s like the masonry is mortared with anti-matter.</p>
<p>Lead producer and NetEase executive vice president Zhipeng Hu adds that this is the “first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games”. They are certainly making no bones of the genre markers they're trying to hit with that video. There’s no release date yet. Learn more on <a href="https://www.blood-message.com/">the official site</a> (which, be warned, is hella animation-heavy and may devour your mobile data allowance in one fell swoop).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first toggle you’ll see is for Smart Steering. Those who played the previous entry likely remember what this means. Anyone who’s jumping into the <em>Mario Kart</em> series for the first time or in a long while is out of luck, since there isn’t any explanation as to what this does.</p><p><strong>Smart Steering is an assistant feature that’s meant to keep you from driving off the edge of a course.</strong> You’ll find yourself being tugged back along the track whenever you get too close to an edge or wall. Visually, it’s represented by a small antenna on the back of your kart that lights up when the feature is activated.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Newer and younger players alike are sure to enjoy Smart Steering’s assistance. However, <strong>enabling this does come with caveats. The obvious setback is that you’ll be unable to perform up to the second level of your mini-turbo</strong>. Not having access to the third and strongest drift boost is a huge detriment when playing online or even in 150cc. Just as challenging is that Smart Steering’s corrections can ruin some of your drifts and make it difficult to take off-road shortcuts. I’ve also experienced a bit of awkwardness when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">trying to Rail Ride</a></span>. As helpful as this feature is, you might enjoy playing without it once you’ve become more familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><h2 id="h335218"><a id=""></a>What is Auto-Accelerate?</h2><p>Directly underneath the Smart Steering option is Auto-Accelerate. This one might be easier to guess, but it’s still pretty vague without a proper definition. <strong>Auto-Accelerate is an assistant feature that constantly keeps the Accelerate input triggered.</strong> Considering that you’re likely pressing down on the A button 99% of the time anyway, this probably sounds like a dream for accessibility reasons or even if you find your thumb getting sore.</p><p>I’d argue this feature is much more of a convenience option that you could use for as long as you play. That being said, it’s not without some problems. <strong>Continuously accelerating means you can’t brake as effectively or go in reverse</strong>. These are minor issues that can be mitigated with experience over time, but they’re still worth taking into account.</p><p>The best part with either of these features is that they can be toggled with a quick visit to the Options menu. Go ahead and experiment whenever you want to make adjustments to your driving ability!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, the launch frenzy has made Final Fantasy one of the hardest sets to actually participate in as a fan, just as its popularity hits new heights.

While reprints are expected as soon as July, and should continue for a while given the<em> Final Fantasy</em> expansion is part of MTG’s standard set of cards (and thus legal in all tournament play), the difficulty of not only finding cards at the moment, but actually being able to afford them, has been a bit of a buzzkill. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-hideo-kojima-game-ranked-death-stranding-metal-gear-solid-pt<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, director Hideo Kojima enters his fourth decade in game development as a director. While the celebrated “auteur” has spent the majority of his career so far working on the Metal Gear series, Death Stranding 2 sees him expanding upon his newest universe, where he both introduces new concepts and revisits some of his most enduring ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a truly staggering list of credits in his impressive resume, there’s no better time to revisit every genre-defying adventure Kojima has taken us on. Here is every Kojima game that he directed or designed, ranked from worst to best.  </p><div id="hideo-kojima-games-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3><h3>Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. Policenauts</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/policenauts-1750275970639.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the Metal Gear Solid series took over his life, Kojima dabbled in the graphic adventure genre. One of his earliest games, Policenauts is a point-and-click, visual novel game for the PC-9821 billed as a hard science fiction detective story. Set in the not-too-distant future, players take on the role of Jonathan Ingram, an astronaut turned hard-boiled L.A. detective investigating a man’s disappearance. As a visual novel, Policenauts doesn’t have the level of gameplay innovations Kojima would eventually be known for, but this early work highlights how movies — in this case buddy cop films like Lethal Weapon — would seep into his video game works for years to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>11. Snatcher</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/snatcher-1750275970640.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Before there was Policenauts, Kojima had already dabbled with graphic adventure games. Clearly influenced by cyberpunk stories like Blade Runner, Snatcher is set in a futuristic city where human-like robots known as Snatchers are murdering humans, with special members of the anti-Snatcher force tasked to stop them. While the plot may sound very derivative of Ridley Scott’s iconic movie, critics praised Snatcher for how Kojima took these ideas to even more extreme places with violence, humor, and an operatic scope that was ahead of most visual novels at the time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/metal-gear-2-1750275970639.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the very first Metal Gear, Konami pushed forward with a sequel called Snake’s Revenge that was being made entirely without any involvement from Hideo Kojima. Unaware a sequel was even being made, a coworker finally told Kojima about the sequel and convinced him to create a true follow-up to the 1987 original. While Metal Gear 2’s visuals are more sophisticated and its story introduces some important characters to the Metal Gear canon, Metal Gear 2 largely feels like a half-step. Thankfully, Kojima <em>would</em> go on to completely revolutionize the series with the 3D Metal Gear Solid games, eventually righting the wrongs of his iterative attempt at progress in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/22/metalgaer-1687441506936.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was originally designed to be the finale of the series, capping off the Solid Snake storyline with a bang. This mega-budget, PS3 exclusive was released in 2008 and set a technological benchmark thanks to its breathtaking graphics and cinematics. Snake is back, but this time he’s aged significantly. The familiar faces of Otocon, Meryl, and Revolver Ocelot all return, as well as other fan-service surprises. Together, these characters work through a story that finally closes the book on an extremely complex tale that began with the very first Metal Gear game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being the dramatic final act in an iconic game series, MGS 4 also represents Kojima indulging in some of his worst creative tendencies. While the plot ties up a lot of loose storylines and gives Old Snake a hero’s farewell, the majority of cutscenes border on self-parody (including one character’s constant need to find a toilet) and Kojima, in general, seems too focused on his nostalgia for older games in the series, which has an impact on the overall execution of Solid Snake’s final tale. There are also a lot of big gameplay ideas here that aren’t fully fleshed out, perhaps due to the technological limitations of the PS3 – some of these mechanics, like active camo, would finally be refined in Metal Gear Solid 5. With all this in consideration, Metal Gear Solid 4, despite being an incredible spectacle in its own right, is our least favorite game from the Metal Gear Solid series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Metal Gear</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/metal-gear-1-1750275970639.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Metal Gear on the MSX2 was the game that started it all, introducing the world to the iconic Solid Snake. Metal Gear combines compelling (and revolutionary for the time) stealth action gameplay with a twisting story of Cold War era paranoia, nuclear proliferation, and espionage. You play as Solid Snake, a young member of the special forces group FOXHOUND sent to stop the development of a new weapon known as Metal Gear. Inspired by James Bond stories and the original Mission: Impossible TV series, Metal Gear stood out in 1987 thanks to a heavily twisting plot that culminates in Snake facing off against Big Boss, Snake’s commanding officer-turned-villain. Metal Gear’s unique stealth gameplay made waves at the time and although its plot was relatively simple, it would end up starting one of the greatest decade-spanning stories in gaming history.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. Death Stranding</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/ds-context-blog-1750069557279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding was a complete departure for Kojima and his first game developed outside of the walls of Konami. Starring Norman Reedus as the post-apocalyptic mailman Sam Porter Bridges, the game is less about sneaking past Soviet agents and more about sneaking past goopy monsters from beyond the astral plane. Despite all the sneaking action, this time around stealth takes a backseat to lots and lots and LOTS of walking. While Death Stranding indulges in heavy use of sponsored products, bizarre character names like Die Hard Man, and an aggressive number of celebrity cameos, underneath all that questionable content might be one of Kojima’s most prophetic stories yet. Set in a world where humans are painfully disconnected from each other due to an apocalyptic event that forces everyone to seclude in bunkers, Death Stranding was actually released before the COVID-19 pandemic. The journey of Sam Porter Bridges as he goes on foot to re-connect the United States with a mystical form of the internet feels like something written in 2023 with all the experience of an isolating lockdown, instead of a game that began development several years prior.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2010/04/09/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker-20100409005241137-3180782.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When Kojima announced the PSP-exclusive Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, he made clear that this was a full-fledged, canonical entry into the Metal Gear series with ramifications for the overarching storyline. And he wasn’t bluffing. The events of Peace Walker, which is set after Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, forms a substantial chapter in the legend of Big Boss and Outer Heaven, and plays directly into the events of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima found a way to cut up his stealth-action gameplay into bite-sized chunks that are perfect for on-the-go fun. Despite the limited technical capabilities of the PSP, mechanically this might be one of the most fun and creative games in the Metal Gear series. New systems like base building, weapons R&amp;D, and recruiting enemy soldiers by fulton-ing them up into space means that Peace Walker not only delivers way beyond expectations for a handheld game, but also stands out as an excellent addition to the series in its own right. These mechanics and plot connections go on to reappear in Metal Gear Solid 5, proving how vital Peace Walker is to the entire Metal Gear canon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain + Ground Zeroes</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/05/15/5---phantom-pain-1526406974754.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain would end up being Kojima’s last Metal Gear game, but in our opinion he left the franchise on a banger, with Metal Gear Solid 5 being the best-playing Metal Gear game in the entire series. Combining decades of stealth action experience and every mechanic Kojima ever fiddled with, MGS 5’s stealth combat feels better than ever. That’s largely thanks to the variety of tools and weapons that can be mixed and matched, ensuring you can infiltrate using your exact preferred playstyle. Want to go in guns blazing on an enemy camp? No problem. Prefer to be the sneaky stealth warrior utilizing camouflage, distractions, and even the time of day to your advantage? You can do that, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid 5 and its prologue, Ground Zeroes, is set after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3 and Peace Walker, focussing once more on Big Boss’ quest to build a private army in the middle of the ocean. If we’re being uncharitable, Metal Gear Solid 5’s big twist feels like Kojima put a lot of effort to explain how Big Boss survived the first Metal Gear game. But Metal Gear Solid 5 feels more like a tone piece where Kojima gets to explore the many horrors of war. From child soldiers, torture, and chemical weapons, to other nightmarish scenarios born of humanity’s never-ending thirst for conflict. Yes, on the whole, the events of MGS 5 don’t affect the overall canon of Metal Gear too much, but by the end of the experience you <em>will </em>begin to feel ashamed for your words and deeds.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. P.T.</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/24/pt-1571935280958.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of gaming’s most famous almosts. P.T. (or Playable Teaser) was meant to be an interactive preview for Kojima’s Silent Hills, the doomed-to-be-cancelled next installment in Konami’s legendary horror series starring Norman Reedus and developed in collaboration with director Guillermo del Toro. P.T was something of a demonstration of Kojima’s intent for that project. At just a couple of hours long, P.T. is set almost entirely within the confines of a single hallway in a non-descript, American house, and is genuinely one of the most terrifying games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trapped in a loop, you are forced to endure terrifying events on every lap of the house, such as the radio recounting a gruesome murder, unimaginable horrors found in the bathroom, and a blood-chilling ghost stalking your every move. This self-contained teaser is so full of terrifying ideas that it’s truly a tragedy that Kojima never got a chance to complete Silent Hills. P.T., however, is so satisfying that even though it can barely be considered a full game, it still feels like a complete experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/08/24/screenshot01-3741-1503534265918.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima famously said that there was a chance that Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1663337502168711168" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>would never be released</u></a>. Scheduled to hit shelves in 2001, a few months after the events of September 11, Kojima explained to Konami’s board of directors the story of Metal Gear Solid 2 and, from his recollection,  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-interview-new-studio-phase-2"><u>“they all turned pale”</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set against a backdrop of government conspiracies, United States war profiteering, and presidents-turned cyborg warriors, Metal Gear Solid 2 is proof that Kojima’s thematic obsessions with nuclear proliferation, memes, and the military-industrial-complex aren’t just for show. He even goes as far as to replace everyone’s favorite Solid Snake with newcomer Raiden to hammer home his points about how the world operates under the shadow of duplicity, and you can never trust anyone to be who they really are (and also because Kojima really did want to introduce a younger playable character to the series).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid 2 is such an astronomical leap above the first Metal Gear Solid in terms of gameplay that it’s hard to believe the two games were released just three years apart. It's Metal Gear Solid on steroids thanks to massively improved graphics that truly capture Kojima’s cinematic intentions, and controls that finally give Snake and Raiden the proper tools to be the ultimate stealth warriors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/25/screenshot-mgs3-4-1684982806235.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered one of the greatest games of all time, and rightly so. With the third entry in his ever-popular series, Kojima took on his biggest challenge yet. Gone are the narrow corridors, tankers and military bases as Metal Gear Solid 3 welcomes the open jungles of the southern USSR. Naked Snake, the code name for the character who’d eventually go on to be called Big Boss and our hero this time around, is forced to brave harsh environments crawling with Soviet soldiers, perform emergency on-the-field first aid, and eat whatever creatures he could catch in the wild (hence that subtitle). It was the ultimate marriage of stealth combat and survivalist wish-fulfilment that would go on to inspire games like Escape From Tarkov.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metal Gear Solid 3, Kojima created one of history’s best tributes to James Bond. Snake’s mission brings him face to face with disfigured villains, sees him fall for a mysterious femme fatale, and is even prefaced by a big, brassy theme song that’s a clear homage to 007’s best intros. But while it features a checklist of Bond’s key tropes, there’s a deep and emotionally resonant story beneath them all: Naked Snake is forced to confront his former mentor, who defects to the Soviet Union to ally herself with the certifiably insane Colonel Volgin. A treatise on the global divisions caused by the Cold War and a continuation of his long-running anti-war themes, Metal Gear Solid 3 stands at the pinnacle of playability, storytelling, and technical achievement.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Metal Gear Solid</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/mgs-1727958519831.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid is the game that put Kojima on the map. While the older Metal Gear games were lauded for their creative gameplay, 1998’s Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation took that innovation and creativity to the next level. At the time, its cinematic storytelling techniques were considered second to none (and even by today’s standards, it remains special), its interactive movie-like presentation demonstrating Kojima’s love and understanding of cinema. The plot of a special ops soldier sneaking into a remote military base to take down a stolen nuclear weapon may be simple compared to some of the later games’ deep lore wells, but it became an instant and enduring classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metal Gear Solid, Kojima’s extraordinary skills as a game developer are clear to see. Advanced stealth mechanics that made extensive use of enemy vision cones, a variety of unique and ingenious boss battles, and uncovering brilliant surprises such as having your game controller “taken over” by Psycho Mantis are long-standing reminders that Kojima’s ideas about how players can interact with video games  (and how video games can interact with their players) were ahead of their time. In an era where so many game developers were focused on pushing the boundaries of graphics and gameplay, Kojima managed to stand head and shoulders above the rest, pushing the medium forward in ways few others could dream of. With MGS, Kojima evolved how games look, play, tell stories, and ultimately, mature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid is a true masterpiece. It’s the game that created the blueprint for generations to come, and truly is Hideo Kojima’s Magnum Opus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s every Hideo Kojima game ranked.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ratatan-is-a-rhythm-strategy-roguelite-that-should-make-patapon-fans-proud.1224123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ratatan-is-a-rhythm-strategy-roguelite-that-should-make-patapon-fans-proud<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Patapon series on the original PSP helped define the quirky and easygoing nature of the much-loved handheld. As one of the first of what you can call a Rhythm-Strategy game, Patapon was all about guiding a plucky following of worshipers against a mounting series of battles – all to the beat of their leader's song. The franchise has been dormant for some time, but that hasn't stopped the original developers from creating their successor, which adds a clever roguelite twist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Summer Game Fest 2025, I had the special opportunity to see the latest build of Ratatan, which cast me as a new leader guiding my determined flock through some challenging skirmishes. It took me a few runs to find my groove in the face of ruthless opposition, but I could still see that Ratatan has so much more in mind than just settling on being a revival of a PSP classic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ratatan Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ratatan takes place in the land of Redo, where music guides the fates of the tiny Cobun. After facing a fierce conflict with invaders, the Cobun team up with a crew of musical guardians known as the Ratatan, who guide the Cobun on a campaign to defend their lands so they can reach fabled lands of the Everafter. By selecting one of several Ratatan armed with special instruments, you'll be able to guide various Cobun units and infantry to battle enemies, retake settlements, and score enough power-ups to take down each of the big bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ratatan channels the flow and pacing of the original Patapon games but ups the sense of scale to the action in a big way. I loved seeing the whimsical and more vibrant art style come to life once the action got going. You control the leader of the pack, but not the units that follow along. To get them in motion, you'll need to execute a command that's in tune with the beat of the Ratatan's flow. These commands include movement, jumping, defensive skills, and, of course, the good ol' offensive strikes. The big trick with Ratatan, much like the Patapon series, is managing to keep your tempo while in the heat of battle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to game producer Saisu Sakijiri, Kazuto discussed the differences in gameplay styles between Ratatan and Patapon, which lean more toward the in-the-moment action of gameplay than the original games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Looking back at Patapon, those games had an RPG style of influence to it, but with Ratatan, we go for a more action-focused take on that gameplay, and of course, with the added roguelite elements going along with it," said the producer. "I was inspired by games like Hollow Knight, which I'm a big fan of, and I wanted to give this type of rhythm action gameplay."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding your rhythm is essential, and I'll admit it certainly took me some time to find mine. I kept asking myself if I was rushing or dragging when it came to landing the beat for commands, but I also had to keep in mind that I needed to anticipate and react to enemy attacks. In one instance, I led a march forward with my units, but they almost immediately walked right into a devastating counterattack from the enemy. Facing these setbacks felt discombobulating, but once I got my groove back, things finally came together, and I was chaining attacks and dodging enemy laser blasts and other hazards with greater ease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key departure from the style of gameplay set by the Patapon series is the move to a roguelite experience. Each run will have you choose from a roster of Ratatan armed with trumpets, drums, tubas, and guitars, who all have their special modifiers and perks to apply in battle. Once the stage was finished, I was able to pick up different modifiers that applied attack and skill bonuses to the units and Ratatan. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a very familiar roguelite loop, but within the context of a rhythm-action game, it feels especially exciting and interesting. Much like Hades and other roguelites that allow you to take in the setting, you can also visit a hub base of sorts that will have characters to chat up. These characters will help the Ratatan by giving you the opportunity to buy persistent upgrades for the squad, allowing them to be more prepared when heading out into a fresh run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the producer of Ratatan, feedback from longtime fans has been coming in for the game following its rapid success on Kickstarter in 2023, which led to the stronger distinction between Ratatan and its focus on a unique experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very happy that fans of the Patapon series have liked what we have with the game so far, but I do feel that Ratatan is very much a successor to Patapon and is doing its own thing," said the producer. "It's been a bit of a challenge to make things more modernized with the roguelite elements, but also realize that it is a challenge for players as well. There is definitely a learning curve for the game, but we're happy to see the feedback that we have been getting from players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From my hands-on with the latest build of Ratatan, it's so far a fun but truly challenging rhythm game. Yet I couldn't help but be drawn in by its infectiously charming world and flow. It's a type of revival that captures the original, quirky tone and gameplay, and hopefully, its larger structure will come together to potentially surpass its forebears.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Can you hear me now?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameChat had proven to be, well, not <em>massively</em> popular with the Nintendo Life community in the run up to the Switch 2 launch. Many had simply refused to participate in the new feature, while others were keen, yet understandably sceptical about the whole idea.</p>
<p>Yet now that it's here, it's safe to say that we, and indeed many of you, are slowly coming around to GameChat. It's basically just voice chat for online play on the Switch 2, which many consoles have featured for years by this point, but as usual, it's been done 'The Nintendo Way'. Which basically means it's ridiculously simple to set up and also weirdly charming in practice.</p>
<p>To discuss things a bit further, Alex and Felix have got together via – you guessed it – GameChat to talk all things GameChat. The duo test out the microphone's capabilities when moving away from the Switch 2 itself, along with how things hold up during a Knockout Tour race in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>So if you're on the fence about getting the camera in particular, then be sure to check out the video at your leisure. But do give GameChat a shot either way; we reckon you'll find it to be surprisingly useful.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Campaign Footage Has Leaked Online From The Latest Battlefield Labs Update]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update.1224108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A short video clip from the single-player campaign for the next mainline entry in the Battlefield series has been pulled from the files of the latest Battlefield Labs update, with dataminer <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">Temporyal discovering and posting the clip to X</a>.</p>
<p>The footage is clearly still a work-in-progress which Temporyal points out, and they also clarify that this is not a clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/">gameplay from a playtest</a> or the<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-showcased-in-new-leaked-video/"> Battlefield Labs test</a> like we've seen with other leaks, but just a video file, which also explains why the footage lacks the watermarks that usually accompany your screen if you've ever participated in a closed playtest.</p>
<p>According to Temporyal, the clip "<em>shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan</em>." Temporyal <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">also reveals that, based on their findings</a>, the campaign will be eight missions long, nine including a prologue, taking players to locations like Tajikistan, Egypt, the USA, and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release for the next Battlefield game, and we don't even know what it's officially called. According to EA, we should know at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">one of those two things soon</a>, with a summer reveal currently set to happen at some unknown point in time from now until September, to be generous.</p>
<p>For all we've seen of the next Battlefield game through leaked footage like this, there's still a lot to be revealed. These leaks are useful to get a sense of what's to come, but they're never the full picture, and there's a lot riding on this next Battlefield game. It's no secret that EA is in need of a big win.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA canceled its Black Panther game,</a> shutting down the studio it had created to make that specific game and laying everyone off. It canceled another incubation project at Respawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off more staff across Respawn</a> and other parts of the company. And at the beginning of the year, EA<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> laid off developers at BioWare</a> following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and its disappointing sales, which reached only half of what EA's top brass had expected.</p>
<p>A report recently dug into everything that happened with The Veilguard's development, and how mismanagement by those <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">same leaders at EA plagued the game from the beginning of its development journey</a>.</p>
<p>Add all the layoffs, internal issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">the sunsetting of hybrid work and a return-to-office call</a>, and game cancellations together, and add to that the fact that the latest entry in the company's biggest sports series <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/electronic-arts-says-dragon-age-and-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-as-it-revises-its-financial-outlook-downward/">underperformed last year</a>, and it doesn't paint a picture of a company that's all flowers and rainbows.</p>
<p>EA needs Battlefield to do well to potentially be a turning point for the company. When the full reveal comes this summer, depending on players reactions to the game, we'll see which way things are beginning to turn.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-3-adds-new-dungeons-and-more-in-august.1224105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed roughly when you can expect&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.3 to land, as well as what it'll bring to the long-running MMORPG when it arrives.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1936032284802793652" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X, Patch 7.3 will arrive in early August, and it'll continue the story of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Patch 7.2</a>. As part of that story continuation, you can look forward to a new dungeon by the name of the Meso Terminal, which will serve as a "glittering monument to Alexandria's eternal queen".</p>

<p>The new update will also continue the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, the second part of which will be called "San d'Oria: The Second Walk". Presumably, you'll be exploring the city of the same name from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, although given that these raids often take players through some weird and wonderful setpieces, that may not be where you end up.</p>

<p>The Cosmic Exploration feature, which is open to crafting and gathering professions, will expand in the new update as well, giving you a whole new planet to discover in the form of Phaenna. Who knows what you'll find for your Hand or Land journey there?</p>

<p>A new Deep Dungeon, Pilgrim's Traverse, will also be available, so if you prefer to take on combat-oriented challenges rather than crafting (or if you're planning to do both), you'll probably want to tackle that one as well.</p>

<p>If you play as a Hrothgar or a Viera, you'll be pleased to know there are also new headgear options available for these races, so your fashion options will be expanded when August rolls around.</p>

However, <strong>if you’re looking to just go along the critical path with minimal side content, you’re looking at about 25-30 hours of playtime to finish the last chapter of the game.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-recommend-id="image://35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-recommend-id="image://35034c22b5dd73b8925022cb72c2b5ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The characters explore a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To unlock all of the game’s Trophies/Achievements, you’re going to have to complete the Devil Chart (the Demon/Persona Compendium for all you <em>SMT</em> and <em>Persona</em> fans), solve all Case Files (side quests), and defeat all of the game’s optional super bosses. <strong>This can add upwards to 30 more hours of gameplay, especially considering that this remaster has included over 50 new demons to the original’s 70, bringing the grand total to more than 120 demons</strong>. So be prepared to spend a lot of time fusing all of the demons!</p><p>There are also two new difficulty modes. The easier one is called Sleuth, which allows you to experience the story without any significantly hard combat encounters and no game-overs if Raidou falls in battle.</p><figure id="" data-id="fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-recommend-id="image://fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-recommend-id="image://fe3baa3e7f6cc6cd2552b5782bc98639" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main character battles demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other mode is called Detective Legend, which is the hardest difficulty in the game. It can only be unlocked in New Game+ after completing the story at least once. Beating the game on Detective Legend also unlocks a Trophy/Achievement, so you’ll need to do at least two playthroughs in order to earn all of the Trophies/Achievements, which add up to a total of 50-60 hours alone.</p><hr><p><br><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</em> is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has a history of packing in tutorial games with some of their hardware, so players were reasonably frustrated to find that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would run them $10. But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h60565"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
