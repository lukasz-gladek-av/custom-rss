			<p>Katsushiro Harada, a General Manager at Bandai Namco and the man everyone identifies the Tekken series with, is leaving the company at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Truth be told, we already had an inkling earlier this year, when Harada shared on his LinkedIn page that he was 'open to work' and interested in roles such as Executive Producer, Executive Game Director, Vice President, Business Development, Business Development Executive, and Marketing. </p>



<p>When Tekken fans panicked, he <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied on X</a> not to worry about it, that he just wanted to 'meet more people' and 'expand his horizons in the future'. Now, though, there's no uncertainty <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403720328897671168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his LinkedIn message</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. [...] I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything.</em></p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada has been involved with the Tekken franchise since the beginning of his nearly 32-year career at Bandai Namco. For the first two installments, he was credited as the voice actor for characters Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu; however, he was promoted to Game Director starting with Tekken 3 in 1997.  As he mentioned in the message, he also worked on other games, like SoulCalibur IV, Ace Combat Infinity, and Pokkén Tournament. More recently, he was also listed as a producer for games published by Bandai Namco, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/man-of-medan-rusted-seaworthy-ghost-ship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Arise</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, his final major project was Tekken 8, which received widespread critical acclaim (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earning a 9/10 on Wccftech</a>) and sold exceptionally well. The publisher would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-has-sold-2-million-units-in-one-month-says-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> that the game sold two million units in its launch month and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-hits-3-million-sold-year-after-launch-milestone-faster-than-tekken-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached three million units</a> one year after its release, outselling its predecessor in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>As a final parting gift for fans, Harada released an hour-long TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), something he always wanted to do but never got the time for. It is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SoundCloud</a>.</p>



<p>Harada will appear as a guest at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, having been invited by Bandai Namco. As for what's next for him, he said he'll let the fans know at a later date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rope Battles Codes (December 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-rope-battles-codes/</link>
            <guid>1375864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Rope Battles monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Diamonds and much more.</p>



<p>Rope Battles is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that sounds rather simple as players are placed in an intense combat arena where they use ropes, traps, items and whatever they can find to battle others. While it sounds like a rather easy game, players need to strategically master various rope techniques, timing, and special abilities to outmanoeuvre opponents. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate rope fighter and battle against friends or other players to test your skills.</p>



<p>Progression in Rope Battles revolves around improving your fighter and collecting the game’s two main currencies: Coins and Diamonds. Like most Roblox games, they are the player’s main resources within the Rope Battles universe and allow them to improve their fighter by buying new ropes, items and more. And so, because earning coins (and diamonds) purely through playing can be slow, redeeming official codes is a major boost — codes give you free Coins, sometimes Diamonds, or even spins.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Crash Bots is a fairly straightforward process with no prerequisite steps. However, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming Crash Bots codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Rope Battles on Roblox.</li>



<li>Click the Code button in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Enter a code into the pop-up text box.</li>



<li>Press Claim and enjoy your rewards.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rope-battles-codes">How To Get More Rope Battles Codes</h2>



<p>Rope Battles codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media pages. That includes the Reworld Makers community on Roblox, which you’ll need to join to access some codes. However, keeping track of the various sources can be time-consuming, especially with no system in place to tell users when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Rope Battles codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

            <p>Speculation is still brewing around the demonic statue <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has planted in the Mojave desert ahead of The Game Awards this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> studio CI Games is the latest to chip in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">Keighley teased the statue at the start of the month</a> with the words "regal.inspiring.thickness", and its demonic lights and skeletal figures had fans guessing which game it was related to, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and God of War being top guesses.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-still-surrounds-keighleys-demon-statue-ahead-of-the-game-awards-as-diablo-4-and-god-of-war-teasers-ruled-out">these were ruled out a day later</a>, with further guesses including Sony's forthcoming shooter Saros, or even Doom. Other studios have even jumped on the bandwagon, with <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1995971888464687211">Devolver quipping</a>: "We made it out of the bones of most of our interns and the remaining interns put it in the desert".</p>

<p>Perhaps the best evidence we have for the statue is a new reply from The Game Awards account, which states: "The [blank] are silent. [Blank] bleeds. New [blank] stir." What could it mean? </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir.</p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1996993470322692176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>CI Games founder and CEO Marek Tyminski has now stepped in, not because the statue is related to the studio's forthcoming Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, but because the studio hopes it's related to something from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> maker FromSoftware.</p><p>"Flattered so many think we're behind that statue," Tyminski wrote on social media. "Can confirm it's not us, we're just as hyped as you are. Devs are praying it's something From. Huge respect to them and we dream of reaching that level one day."</p>
<p>Tyminski added "big news" is on the way for both Lords of the Fallen and its sequel, adding: "We've listened. Soon it's time to reveal."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are.

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>So could it really be something from FromSoftware? The DLC for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign has already been released, and the statue doesn't look related to either the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition or Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods, both due next year.</p>
<p>More likely, Tyminski is simply hoping for some positive attention in aligning the studio's work with that of FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen released back in 2023 and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">two star review from Eurogamer</a>. While the studio has put in work to improve its poor launch day performance, it remains an unoriginal imitator of FromSoftware's Dark Souls games.</p>

            <p>The team behind Amazon's Fallout TV show hopes to begin shooting the third series this coming summer, with the goal to release new seasons as fast as possible.</p>
<p>That's coming from the series' executive producer, Jonathan Nolan. "With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," Nolan said in an interview with IGN (video below), before quipping: "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans, and all."</p>

<p>The executive producer said he believes the "scope" of the Fallout show remains "undiminished season to season", and the cast and crew were all able to "work quickly enough" to get the second series "back on the air in a reasonable amount of time".</p>
<p>And, it seems this zippy way of doing things is something Nolan and the team want to continue.</p>
<p>"I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend," Nolan said. "You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>

<p>Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November last year</a>, and that December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins shared a close up of the show's prosthetic team applying the Ghoul's leathery, nuclear worn skin</a>. Filming paused for a period following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">devastating wildfires which raged across multiple districts of Los Angeles and shut down production across Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>But even with this setback, the second season of Fallout is still airing a little over a year after filming first began. Its third season, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">was confirmed back in May of this year</a>.</p>

            <p>Katsuhiro Harada, has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p>
<p>"I'd like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025," he wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas. I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p>
<p>"The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator. Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the centre of my identity. And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars. Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p>

<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi - whom I respect as though he were another father - and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>"Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects - VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p>
<p>"To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>"I'll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything."</p>
<p>If you've been following Harada's outspoken comments over the past few years, this may not come as much of a surprise: the Tekken boss has made a few suggestions that his future may not rest within the walls of the Japanese publisher. First up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">he had a 'looking for work' tag on his LinkedIn page</a>, leading people to speculate that he was looking for the door in his current place of work.</p><p>Then, earlier this year, Harada spoke to Eurogamer about what a future without him would look like at Bandai Namco. "[I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">he told Connor Makar at Evo 2025</a>. "[Producer Michael Murray and I are] public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Murray also mentioned that he may have 'only one Tekken game left in him', so it feels like there could be a potential shift in the franchise as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> continues to grow and people start to think about what Tekken 9 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> 3) could look like.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since launch. Alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of emergency patches</a> that had to be issued by the developer to appease irritated fans, there was also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-reneges-on-its-controversial-dlc-rollout-but-is-it-too-little-too-late">a glut of controversy</a> surrounding the game and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-street-fighter-6-monetization-hurdle">its DLC methods</a>, which Harada - in typical fashion - was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-community-up-in-arms-over-plans-to-add-premium-currency-to-game-post-launch">very outspoken about</a>.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the game losing its identity without the dynamic, public-facing duo, fret not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> was the first game in the series for years that didn't include much input from Yoshinori Ono, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-figurehead-yoshinori-ono-leaves-capcom-after-nearly-30-years">who also left Capcom after 30 years with the company</a>. Street Fighter 6 has been a massive success, however, proving that there is life in these storied fighting games - even without the notable figureheads leading the charge with the crowd-facing side of development.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major will run from December 11 – 14 and will feature a single-elimination bracket featuring eight of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business. Leading up to the grand final, every match will be a typical best-of-three run, while the grand final itself is more meaty with a best-of-five requirement.</p>

<p>In terms of the next stage, it’s easy to see the teams that are <strong>most likely </strong>going to make it through. It’</p>



<p>It’s a solid bet to assume that the semifinals will consist of Vitality, Team Spirit, FaZe, and FURIA. Looking even further, it’s easy to see a Team Spirit vs. FaZe Clan final, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Season 3 of Prime Video’s Fallout may be filming as soon as Summer 2026, should one executive’s hopes come true. Its second season is only weeks away and, with a third season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-already-announced-before-season-2-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in production</a>, fans seemingly won’t have to wait long to return to the wasteland.</p>



<p>In the world of great adaptations, none came more of a surprise than Prime Video’s Fallout. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the series goes its own route yet keeps the action, heart, and comedy of the games. Released in 2024, the series was a smash hit with fans and critics. In fact, it was nominated for several Emmys, including Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. A second season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly greenlit</a>, now set in the vibrant New Vegas. With its release on December 17th, fans already can’t wait to see more. Fortunately, it seems filming is happening sooner than expected.</p>

<p>In an interview for IGN, series creator Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet chatted about Season 2. At the tail-end of the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/7Xes4q43OcI?si=PdsmZGkkQfDQUtRM&amp;t=1073">at around 17:50</a>, a question about Season 3 and possible locales was asked. In response, Jonathan Nolan stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Well, I say with regards to production, we’re hoping to be shooting again next summer</strong>,” says Nolan in the interview. “<strong>We’ll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all</strong>. I’m excited that, though the scope of the show feels undiminished season on season, Geneva and Graham and our incredibly talented cast and crew were able to work quickly enough to get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time. I think what’s happened with television, in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season, is kind of an unfortunate trend. You don’t want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that <strong>we like to be back on the air as soon as we can</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite Nolan’s comment, it seems a Summer 2026 filming date is not yet set in stone, so nothing is confirmed just yet. A third season was greenlit back in March 2025 after filming wrapped on the second season and seemingly started production then. If it does film in Summer 2026, fans could see the third season release as soon as Spring 2027, if all goes well. It’s too soon to say where the story will go with it, but given how well the first season did, it seems it’ll be in good hands. Either way, the December 17th release for Prime Video’s Fallout can’t come soon enough.</p>







<p>What do you think of Fallout Season 3 possibly shooting in Summer 2026? Is it too soon? Where do you hope the show goes next?

GoChess Wizard comes with 32 sculpted game pieces made of high density ABS and vinyl. Each magnetic piece matches the medieval-inspired designs from the films and has intricate details. The white and black pieces are packaged in triangle slabs with custom slots to ensure they arrive in pristine condition. The pieces can also be stored in two Harry Potter-branded drawstring pouches.</p><p>The premium magnetic game board is only 0.34 inches thick and has built-in smart features. Each square has light LED lighting rings to display valid moves, make suggestions, and signal where to move the CPU pieces when playing solo. The chess bot has 32 difficulty levels and can be used as a personal trainer via the free companion app. Additionally, you can play online with friends and via matchmaking by connecting the companion app to Lichess or Chess.com.</p><p>The GoChess Wizard also comes with a smartphone/tablet stand and a USB-C charging cable. The board runs for 5-10 hours on a full charge and takes two hours to recharge.</p><p>There are two versions of the GoChess Wizard. The Mini comes with a 13.1 x 13.1-inch board and 1.37-inch squares. The GoChess Wizard Lite is a full tournament-size board--19 x 19 inches and 1.88-inch squares--but otherwise these sets are the same.</p><p>As of December 7, only the GoChess Wizard Mini is in stock with a $300 (was $380) holiday launch deal from Particula and Amazon.

This Bluetooth-enabled 3 x 3 cube has LED lights and positional tracking that registers each rotation and turn in the app. The app has an academy that walks you through the process of solving the cube for the first time. From there, you compete against players around the world, play minigames and puzzles, and track your progress with your solves to see where you can improve.</p><p>The GoCube's app integration is superb and the cube itself is solid. This is a magnetic cube, though it doesn't turn anywhere close to as fast as high-end speed cubes. The pillowed design also makes it feel different from traditional cubes.</p><p>For beginners and anyone who wants as change of pace by playing minigames and solving puzzles, the GoCube Edge is fantastic. I learned how to solve a 3 x 3 cube using the GoCube Edge in 2024. Today, I can solve every square cube up to 13 x 13. I still return to the GoCube Edge to practice and play minigames, because the smart cube features are so good.</p><p>There's also a 2 x 2 version of the GoCube for $35 (was $60). You can bundle the two models together for $73 (was $133). The GoCube comes with a carrying pouch, charging stand, and USB charging cable.</p><ul><li><strong>GoCube Edge 3 x 3 Smart Cube -- $40 (<del>$73</del>)</strong><ul><li><a

<p>Use these Roblox Spear Fishing monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Coins and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spear Fishing, as the name hints, is a fishing-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulation. Your only job is to hunt down the rarest sea creatures in the water areas using Harpoons, Baits, Fish Basket, and Spear Guns. To kill Mythic, Legendary, and even Epic creatures, in some cases, you’ll need the finest tools. However, one must spend a large number of Coins and Gems to purchase them. This is when the active Spear Fishing codes come into action, as they can be redeemed for free Gems and Coins. This guide features all active codes, the code redemption process, tips for investing the free resources, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-reward-code-pay2win/</link>
            <guid>1375732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, has trolled the Escape from Tarkov community with a code appropriately named ‘PAY2WIN’. On social media, the prolific developer posted an image featuring some of the most valuable items in Escape from Tarkov, announcing that a code would drop soon, suggesting that those very items would be obtainable.</p>



<p>When the code dropped, it was with a tongue-in-cheek reference: ‘PAY2WIN’. However, upon redeeming the code, players quickly learned that they’d been hilariously duped.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay2win-was-a-joke-all-along">PAY2WIN Was a Joke All Along</h2>



<p>The code that Nikita Buyanov was teasing led users to believe they’d be getting <strong>stacks</strong> of stuff in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>This image included an FLIR optic, an Altyn helmet, stacks of Bitcoins, and a THICC case, amongst other things. However, shortly after, Nikita revealed the code, PAY2WIN, and users quickly set about redeeming it in the game’s launcher.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The bundle was ultimately unveiled as one of the worst stacks of items you’d ever hope to get in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This includes some of the most useless weapons, such as the TOZ and the Blicky, one of the smallest backpacks, a pack of croutons, a fuze (but no grenade), and a replica helmet. You literally couldn’t have asked for a worse bundle.</p>



<p>It’s not often that the Escape from Tarkov developers crack a joke like this, but they’ve admittedly given away quite a lot of stuff recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-escape-from-tarkov-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more reward codes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s often pointed out that ‘free is free’, but perhaps this bundle isn’t even worth anything!</p>







<p>Did you redeem the code in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know if you’re happy with your little Blicky on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

        <p>Nintendo Switch 2 took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, too.</p>

            <p>The European Top 20 didn't welcome any new entries last week, but Black Friday week saw a boost in sales nonetheless thanks in no small part to Sony, which was seemingly the MVP of Black Friday, hoovering up 62 percent of all console sales in the UK over the week.</p>
<p>The data – supplied by NielsenIQ and GSD, and published by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> – showed that console sales were much stronger this holiday period, with revenue up 14 per cent, and unit sales up 7 percent.</p>

<p>And while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that had its best week outside of launch. Xbox Series S and X accounted for just 10 percent of all console sales, possibly because Xbox consoles were discounted by around 8 percent on the typical price, but PS5 Slim consoles were down 21-34 percent depending upon the model.</p>
<p>Accessory sales, however, were down 17 percent when compared to the same period last year, as did joypad  and headset sales, which tumbled by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>And while both the Meta Quest 3 and the PS5 VR headsets enjoyed their best weeks of the year, overall, VR headset sales dropped by around 7 percent, too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-admits-it-would-be-difficult-for-japanese-developers-to-make-games-in-the-same-way-mihoyo-does">Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China</a>, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p>

            <p>UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - says it has been "forced" into placing its "entire team on notice of redundancy" because publisher THQ Nordic has shown no "enthusiasm or financial support to continue development" of its latest title, Wreckreation.</p>
<p>Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dangerous-driving-devs-wreckreation-is-an-open-world-racer-with-a-diy-focus">unveiled Wreckreation back in 2022</a>. A custom-content-focused open-world racer, it released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in October this year. Now, however, in a heartfelt message posted to X/Twitter, CEO Fiona Sperry said that it was "a heartbreaking moment for all of us", but hoped that by going public, "someone out there might also see the potential" in Wreckreation.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard – with heart and dedication – to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project," Sperry wrote.</p>
<p>"But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.</p> <div>

<p>"We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post-launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful."</p>
<p>Because of claims it has had to self-fund, Sperry added that the studio cannot be sustained and it "will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future," (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/wreckreation-developer-puts-its-entire-staff-on-notice-as-publisher-thq-nordic-abandons-it-we-simply-cannot-sustain-the-studio-in-its-current-form/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>

            <p>Iam8bit is suing Skybound Games for £2.9 million ($4 million), alleging breach of contract, fraudulent expenses, theft of designs, and claiming that Skybound used iam8bit's trade secrets to cut it out of a Stray deal.</p>
<p>Iam8bit – which entered into a partnership with Robert Kirkman's game studio, Skybound, in 2021 – alleges Skybound failed to provide its contractually obligated monthly reports, and "padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items".</p>

<p>After Skybound was reportedly unable to provide evidence of the line items to a third-party auditor, 8bit has now filed a breach-of-contract complaint with the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>In the complaint seen by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html">Engadget</a>, iam8bit similarly claims that after designing promotional materials for the launch of Stray, Skybound used iam8bit's materials to secure its own deal for the Nintendo Switch port, intentionally cutting the latter out while using "almost exact copies" of 8bit's marketing materials.</p>
<p>Iam8bit also claims Skybound used confidential information about 8bit's royalty split with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> to cut it out of the deal.</p>
<p>In all, iam8bit is suing for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation. It's seeking real and punitive damages totalling $4 million. Neither company has publicly commented on the lawsuit.</p>

Snow might be settling in where you are, temperature's dropping — or perhaps you're lucky to be reading from somewherein the southern hemisphere. But there's one thing that remains the same wherever you're reading from; it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> time once again!</p>
<p>Here we are once again, looking back at the last month of excellent releases. And it was a busy one in Switch 2 land, with two major Nintendo releases in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and Kirby Air Riders both launching. Did we get time to play much else?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wslvxn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> we did — and we've got a handful of the best hidden gems here from November 2025. Same rules as always apply: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from November 2025 from titles we've reviewed of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194301 @ 1765187250 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Admittedly, the eShop was a bit quieter than previous months this year, so we have a limited selection. Looking at just 8/10s, so the best of the best, 5 games were in contention for the three spots. But that just means all five of these are absolutely worth your time.</p>
<p>Here's what just missed out, with the top three to follow...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/morsels">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/videoverse">8/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">3rd Place - Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Well wasn't this a nice surprise? The first of Lara's reboot series came to Switch and Switch 2 on the eShop in November, and it's a pretty impressive port, if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is a refreshing reminder of the talent at Crystal Dynamics, a studio that has been hit by layoffs over the years. While Mouse Mode and graphical fidelity hold this back from being the definitive way to play, it's still a great way to experience Lara's origins. The gameplay is as rock-solid as ever, and the visual design and world is incredible.</p>
<p>We recommend the Switch 2 version wholeheartedly, and scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">an 8/10 in our review</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194042 @ 1765187250 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Goodness, it's like Level-5 never let off the gas. After wowing us with Fantasy Life i earlier this year (an eShop Selects winner, too!), the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> launched in November after years of delays and name changes. And, guess what? It's excellent.</p>
<p>Packed from goal-to-goal, Victory Road is a game that feels like you could play it forever. Heck, you don't even have to engage with everything, because the central soccer RPG loop is so darn good that you might not want to do anything else. It's a fabulous return for the series, and has us ever hopeful for that remake.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another 8/10 in our books</a>, meaning that Inazuma Eleven is worth the wait; the Switch 2 version is excellent, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194063 @ 1765188406 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">1st Place - Demonschool (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> might have been late to class — it was delayed multiple times prior to its release last month — but here's another game that was absolutely worth the wait. So worth it, in fact, that it <em>just</em> sneaked into the top spot to become month's eShop Selects winner.</p>
<p>Twisting tactical RPG gameplay into a new form, and blending it with daily school life and demon hunting, Demonschool is almost too cool for school. It's bloody, messy, and street smart, full of quips and humour and dashes of Italian horror-inspired imagery. We can't get enough of that unique grid-based action, either.</p>
<p>Rounding out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demonschool">our set of 8/10s</a>, Demonschool earns top marks from us, and we hope you consider enrolling.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-november-2025]]></content:encoded>
