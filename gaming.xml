The past four releases in the series have been <em>Modern Warfare II</em> (2022), <em>Modern Warfare III</em> (2023), <em>Black Ops 6</em> (2024), and <em>Black Ops 7</em> (2025), but moving forward, Activision wants to offer “an absolutely unique experience each and every year,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> came out in November to mixed reviews, and in Europe, the game had a “disappointing launch,” <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, Treyarch Senior Director of Production Yale Miller <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-admit-theyre-worried-about-series-fatigue-after-back-to-back-games-3255551/">told <em>CharlieIntel</em></a> that he was worried about <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Black Ops 7</em> being seen as too similar.</p><p>“We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental,” Activision says. “While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.” The post also notes that “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams” and that the “next era” of <em>Call of Duty</em> will “deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward.”</p><p>This year, <em>Call of Duty</em> is also facing competition from EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/800922/battlefield-6-is-off-to-a-good-start">more than 7 million copies</a> in its first three days of launch and is already being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">touted by EA as</a> the “best selling shooter game of the year,” and Arc Raiders, which has <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/lAG8/RG5i/c5pp.pdf">sold more than 4 million copies</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back]]></content:encoded>

Each action demands purpose; every misstep can be fatal.</p><p>After each victory, choose your next path and grow stronger. The mightier you become, the deadlier your future foes will be.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Since the day Onis rose from the depths of hell, calamity has plagued the land. Even on the rare occasion that one was slain, its soul would simply return to a new body, and the endless cycle of death and devastation continued without pause.</p><p>Amid this despair, a divine Sakura tree took root. Blessed by the Gods, this sacred tree is a divine vessel capable of sealing Oni souls and preventing their rebirth. This miracle came to be known as Onikura.</p><p>But the Onis still need to be defeated, so brave warriors from every corner of the land took up their swords and set out to destroy the Oni and deliver their souls to the great Sakura tree. But none ever returned—but one.</p><p>You are Tensai, the final Onikura Samurai—a human-god resonance born at the village where the divine Sakura tree took root. Your sword is the world’s last hope. You will hunt down the remaining Onis, seal their corrupted souls within Onikura, and bring an end to the cycle once and for all.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1012579"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Every time an Oni is sealed, its soul is purified by the divine Sakura tree, transforming into Omamori—talismans that bless Tensai with unique abilities. </p><p>Before each encounter, freely combine Omamori to forge your own combat style. Will you master flawless parries, sacrifice your life in exchange for deadly strikes, or channel spiritual energy to control the arena from afar?</p><p>There is no ultimate build—only your path as the true Onikura Samurai.</p><p><strong>Art Style</strong></p><p>Featuring meticulously hand-crafted, high-frame pixel art, <em>Onikura</em> fuses oriental elegance with a haunting post-apocalyptic world set in Ancient Japan. </p><p>Every duel with the Oni unfolds in a special arena—ruined shrines, war-torn villages, and blood-soaked sakura groves. Each Oni carries its own backstory. Beneath the petals of the divine Sakura Tree, only your brave sword can decide the fate of the world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>The Pokemon Company has revealed the next slate of Ranked Battle rewards coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Players will have a chance to earn Mega Stones for the Hoenn starter Pokemon--Sceptile, Swampert, and Blaziken--during the next few seasons of the game's online multiplayer mode.</p><p>Like other special Mega Stones, these elusive items are not otherwise obtainable in the game, so you'll need to participate in Ranked Battles if you want to snag them.

<p>As before, you'll need to hit a certain rank before the season ends to earn the Mega Stones. Previous rewards, such as the Mega Stones for Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, were distributed upon reaching rank S.</p><p>Season 3 is currently underway until December 17 and offers the aforementioned Chesnaughtite stone, as well Delphoxite and Greninjite for those who missed them during previous seasons. Season 4 will offer a Mega Stone for Baxcalibur, one of the Pokemon receiving a brand-new Mega Evolution in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-dlc-is-coming-really-soon-brings-new-mega-evolutions-and-donuts/1100-6535993/" data-ref-id="1100-6535993">Mega Dimension DLC</a>.</p><p>The expansion launches on December 10 and features new story content revolving around the mythical Pokemon Hoopa, which can create portals that let you enter an alternate dimension called Hyperspace Lumiose.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-gaming-laptop-with-solid-specs-40gb-ddr5-1tb-ssd-drops-70-off-amazon-goes-zero-profit-to-dump-stock-2000651754</link>
            <guid>1377880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon occasionally drops deals that seem too aggressive to be real and this Lenovo gaming laptop falls squarely into that category with specifications that cover gaming, entertainment and serious work tasks across the board. Lenovo’s own website sells this machine at full price without any discounts, but Amazon has slashed 70% off in what appears to be a final clearance situation: You’re looking at a laptop with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/">40GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor now priced at $899 instead of the typical $2,999 asking price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Handle Heavy Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 5 7535HS processor has six cores and twelve threads</strong> that run at a base clock speed of 3.3GHz and when you need extra power for heavy tasks, it can boost up to 4.55GHz. This chip architecture gives great single-threaded performance for gaming, and the multi-core setup can handle video editing, 3D rendering, or running multiple virtual machines at the same time without any problems. The 16MB L3 cache keeps data that is often accessed close to the processor cores which lowers latency and makes all applications more responsive.</p>



<p>The 40GB DDR5 RAM setup is very good for a laptop in this price range and gives the system enough room to grow, even though most users won’t use it all the time. DDR5 memory has a higher bandwidth than DDR4, which helps integrated graphics work better and speeds up tasks that move a lot of data around. You can have 50 tabs open in Chrome, work on several large files in Photoshop, and keep Spotify streaming in the background and you will still have resources available for whatever you want to do next.</p>
<p>With a PCIe NVMe SSD, the storage space can hold up to 1TB and it loads your operating system in seconds and opens applications almost instantly. The difference in speed between this solid-state storage and regular hard drives changes the way people use computers every day: You no longer have to wait for things to happen when you use your computer, and you can keep your whole game library, a big collection of photos, and work documents all in one place without having to constantly switch between external drives or cloud storage.</p>



<p>The<strong> 15.3-inch screen has a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which gives you more vertical space than a standard 1080p screen. This is helpful when working with documents, spreadsheets, or code. The IPS panel keeps colors true and has better viewing angles than TN panels. The 300-nit brightness rating makes sure that the screen can be seen even in bright places or near windows. Anti-glare coating makes it easier on your eyes when you work for a long time by spreading out reflections that would otherwise bounce off the screen.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is the newest standard for wireless networks, and it offers faster speeds and better performance in crowded network environments than older standards. Bluetooth 5.3 connects your peripherals with a longer range and more stability and <strong>the mix of USB-A and USB-C ports</strong> makes sure that both old and new accessories will work with it. The USB-C port supports Power Delivery 3.0, which lets you charge your devices quickly, and DisplayPort 1.2, which lets you connect external monitors so you can work at a desk. The<strong> HDMI output gives you another way to connect a display</strong>, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> makes it easier to transfer photos from cameras, and the <strong>headphone jack</strong> is for audiophiles who like wired connections.</p>
<p>A $2,100 discount on a laptop is the kind of deal that makes people raise their eyebrows, but looking at the specs shows that you’re getting real hardware instead of old parts dressed up with marketing language. Lenovo usually charges well into the thousands for laptops with this much RAM and storage, so the $899 price is almost too good to be true. The 70% off sale means that Amazon got too much stock and needs to get rid of it quickly.</p>

We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World an 8 out of 10</a> in our review, with Logan Plant saying, “Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has been flying off shelves despite a lack of Black Friday deals, and then even more so after retailers finally dropped the price by $50 off and on during Cyber Week.

But it also meant we didn’t get a lot of “crazy toy maker” experiments, like alarm clocks, cardboard backpacks, or micro-sized consoles. Which is why my pick for the perfect Nintendo fan gift this year isn’t exactly something truly new: it’s the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime-4-beyond/Amiibo_Functionality,_Rewards,_and_Unlocks">Metroid Prime 4 amiibo</a> triple threat of Samus herself, Samus &amp; Vi-O-La, and bounty hunter Sylux. Metallic paint amiibo are often some of the best – and I’m really liking the more aggressive stance of the standalone Samus and her shiny-red new suit and motorbike combo. Sylux himself looks a bit like an evil, blue Masterchief, rocking his trademark shoulder spikes. </p></div><div id="233483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Samus &amp; Vi-O-La - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233485"><div id="233485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Sylux Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Metroid amiibo are available now and Sylux is out now (as of December 4).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3.

Its matte material feels fantastic in the hands (and somehow never gets grimy), the control sticks have a great level of tension, the ZL and ZR triggers fit your fingers perfectly, and the new GL and GR back buttons add extra flexibility to whatever game you’re playing. Plus, it has a headphone jack, which was easily the Switch 1 Pro Controller’s biggest weakness. And, it has fantastic battery life – I’ve only had to charge mine a handful of times since the Switch 2 launched in June. Sure, Switch 1 controllers work on Switch 2, but the hardcore Nintendo fan in your life deserves this massive upgrade.</p></div><div catalogid="09569512-2c92-4dd0-88a7-4eb7d80358a4" id="224941"><div id="224941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4.

Even if you don't use it for its intended alarm…o purposes, it's still an adorable time piece to keep on your desk. The screen is bright and crisp, and the dial on the top feels excellent to use and set. Best of all, they added Kirby with the most recent update, and who doesn't love Kirby?

We called Donkey Kong Bananza a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10/10 masterpiece in our review</a> back in July, praising its destructible environments and incredible movement. It may not star Mario or Link, but this is a top-shelf first-party Nintendo game that got the Switch 2 generation off to a smashing start. It takes between 15 and 20 hours just to reach the credits, with dozens of more hours waiting for anyone that wants to see absolutely every banana tucked inside.

It takes bits and pieces of Legends: Arceus and Scarlet and Violet that brought new life to the series and flat out does those things better. The entire story takes place in a single location (Luminose City), which seems so small until the game starts to unfold and you meet new people and unlock new areas. It’s the urban Pokémon game I didn’t know I needed, and I’d recommend it to any fellow Pokéfan looking for their next obsession.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233490"><div id="233490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon™ Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ignore-the-mini-4-pro-new-dji-mini-5-pro-bundle-with-3-batteries-drops-to-new-all-time-low-2000651747</link>
            <guid>1377859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The DJI Mini 4 Pro held its position as the go-to compact drone for years but<strong> DJI released the Mini 5 Pro in September</strong> with upgrades that push the boundaries of what sub-250-gram drones can accomplish. Staying under that 250-gram threshold matters because it keeps you clear of FAA registration requirements in the United States which this an ideal drone for beginners and enthusiasts who want hassle-free flying.</p>
<p>This <em>Fly More Combo</em> bundle delivers everything you need for serious aerial photography right out of the box, including the DJI RC 2 controller with its built-in screen and three batteries for extended flying sessions. And right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $1,099, down from the usual $1,599</a>&nbsp;which makes this the perfect moment to invest in one of the most capable lightweight drones ever made.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional-Quality Video</h2>
<p>The 1-inch CMOS sensor is a big step up from the smaller sensors in older Mini models as it captures a lot more light and detail in each frame. With this bigger sensor, you can record <strong>4K video at 60 frames per second with HDR support</strong> and it gives you footage with a wide dynamic range that keeps details in both bright skies and dark landscapes. The Mini 5 Pro has color depth and clarity that are as good as or better than what you would get from much bigger, more expensive drones. This makes it a real tool for content creators who need professional results without having to carry around heavy equipment.</p>



<p>The <strong>225-degree gimbal rotation gives you creative options</strong> that fixed-angle gimbals can’t match: You can shoot true vertical content for social media without cropping or losing resolution, and you can tilt the camera to get dynamic establishing shots, follow subjects from interesting angles, or get footage from above that smoothly changes into footage from the front. This flexibility is especially useful when filming real estate, action sports, or travel videos, where different angles keep viewers interested. The gimbal stabilization system <strong>keeps the video smooth even when there is a little wind</strong>&nbsp;which is great because amateur drone videos are often shaky.</p>
<p><strong>Omnidirectional obstacle sensing</strong> uses both forward-facing LiDAR and vision sensors to find obstacles in all directions: This makes a safety net that keeps you from crashing even if you’re more focused on framing your shot than watching where you’re flying. The <strong>Nightscape feature</strong> improves this obstacle detection system for flights at night by using LiDAR to map your surroundings when regular vision sensors have trouble seeing in low light.</p>



<p><strong>ActiveTrack 360° has been improved to follow people more reliably</strong> with faster response times and different tracking modes that work in different situations. You can have the drone fly around you while you stay focused, follow behind at a set distance, or track from the side for dynamic parallel shots. The system is better at keeping cyclists and runners centered in the frame, even when they turn or speed up.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Flight Battery Plus that comes with this bundle gives you an extra 52 minutes of battery life, so you can stay in the air for a long time before you need to land and change batteries. With<strong> three batteries, you can fly for more than two and a half hours</strong> before you need to recharge. The charging hub charges all three batteries in about 193 minutes and manages the charging sequence well so you don’t have to wait hours between flying sessions. The <strong>internal storage space is 42GB</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with microSD cards before every flight, and you’ll never miss a shot because your card is full.</p>
<p>The <strong>DJI RC 2 controller has a bright built-in screen</strong> that you can see even in direct sunlight which means you don’t have to connect your phone and drain its battery while flying. It is easy to use the controls because there are separate buttons for key functions. You can change camera settings or start intelligent flight modes without having to go through menus. Both the drone and controller can be folded up and stored in a small bag or backpack, making it easy to take with you on hikes, road trips, or any other adventure where you want to get aerial footage.</p>
<p>It might seem like a lot to spend $1,099 on a drone bundle, but when you look at how much other systems with similar features cost, it doesn’t seem so bad. DJI usually keeps prices steady on new products, so this 31% discount on hardware that just came out a few months ago is a great deal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-slashes-playstation-vr2-to-black-friday-low-now-cheaper-than-meta-quest-3s-and-perfect-for-ps5-owners-2000651740</link>
            <guid>1377853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Virtual reality transforms gaming from something you watch on a screen into an experience where you’re actually inside the game world, and if you own a PS5, the <strong>PlayStation VR2 delivers that immersion better than any other console VR system available</strong>. Sony’s second-generation headset offers a massive leap forward from the original PSVR and it packs cutting-edge technology that makes virtual worlds feel tangible and responsive.</p>
<p>Previous holiday seasons saw this headset stubbornly hold its full retail price, but this year brings a welcome <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">change with the VR2 dropping to $299 on Amazon, down from its standard $399 price tag</a>. This <strong>matches the Black Friday pricing</strong> and marks a record low for hardware that elevates your PS5 gaming experience to another dimension.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Follows Your Eyes and Responds to Your Touch</h2>
<p><strong>Eye tracking technology</strong> built right into the headset makes gameplay possible that wasn’t possible before: It lets games show detail where you’re looking while using less processing power in other areas. This foveated rendering method keeps frame rates smooth and visuals clear without making your PS5 send the most detail across the whole field of view at once. Eye tracking not only improves performance, but it also lets you interact with the game in new ways. For example, you can aim weapons, choose menu options, or start events just by looking at them.</p>



<p>The <strong>headset feedback system sends physical sensations</strong> directly through the unit itself. For example, you can feel the rumble of an explosion, the tension of a bowstring, or the impact of raindrops through vibrations that go along with the sound and picture. The <strong>adaptive triggers and haptic feedback in the VR2 Sense controllers work together</strong> with these haptic pulses to make a single sensory package where every action has a physical effect. Adaptive triggers change their resistance based on what you’re doing in the game, so pulling back a bowstring or squeezing a trigger feels different from one another. Finger touch detection can tell when your fingers are resting on buttons and when you are actively pressing them.</p>
<p>The <strong>4K HDR screen has 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>&nbsp;which makes the images clear and gets rid of the “screen-door effect” that used to happen with older VR headsets, where you could see individual pixels making a grid pattern. HDR support gives virtual worlds the right amount of contrast and color depth, making bright highlights stand out while keeping details in dark areas. The<strong> 110-degree field of view</strong> is wide enough to feel natural without causing distortion that some ultra-wide FOV headsets have. It also keeps things clear at the edges of your peripheral vision.</p>



<p><strong>Sony’s Tempest engine makes 3D audio</strong> that lets you pinpoint the exact location of footsteps, gunfire, or background noise with amazing accuracy. This adds important spatial awareness that makes the game more immersive and effective. The PS5’s single USB-C connection makes setup much easier than the original PSVR’s cable nest, so you can get into games faster and with less trouble. Inside-out tracking uses cameras in the headset to map your play space without needing any outside sensors.</p>
<p>For $299, the PlayStation VR2 is a great deal because Sony usually keeps first-party hardware at full retail price for years after it comes out: The $100 off makes high-end VR technology more affordable, especially since you’re getting eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals that other PC VR setups would charge a lot more to match.</p>

<figcaption><em>Find Your Words </em>is all about trying to communicate without speech.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Co-creators Vic Nguyen and Jon Maur say that <em>Find Your Words </em>was inspired by raising "non-speaking kids", which is why the game's main character doesn't communicate through speech; instead, they'll use a system of symbols discovered around the game's world to help them speak to others.</p><p>Combining symbols in different ways will give them "unique meanings", Capybara Games says, and you'll need to combine those symbols in certain ways in order to get your message across to those who communicate with more conventional methods.</p><p><em>Find Your Words </em>utilizes a form of <a href="https://oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/cit/resources/aac/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">AAC</a> (alternative and augmentative communication), a system that uses charts, photographs, symbols, and other non-verbal methods to help non-speaking children to communicate. It sounds like a great place to start if you're a total neophyte to AAC (as I am!).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Find Your Words</em>, which showcases the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-adventure-lil-gator-game-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="18770544-2804-4295-8528-2dea52074262" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Lil Gator Game</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f775e3d3-b847-4a43-af06-09cef92662a9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>To a T</em></a>-style aesthetic direction, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, it's a cozy MMO developed by the folks behind the similarly snuggly <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cozy-grove" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1bcbf8e-3646-43c1-a749-5b4dfa26e9b4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a><em> </em>(I mean, the clue's right there in the name).</p><p>Described by Spry Fox as a game about "the joy of shared experiences, creative expression, and connection with friends", <em>Spirit Crossing </em>takes place in a "vast, beautiful world with ever-changing environments".</p><p>Upon starting the game, you'll be assigned to a Waystation, a smaller community-within-the-community, and together with your fellow Waystation members, you'll "collectively build, decorate, and fortify" your little patch of cozy ground.</p><p>Don't worry, though; there's no PvP play in <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, although you can travel to other players' Waystations and engage in "co-op activities such as harvesting, dancing, and mural painting" if you want.</p>
<p>Rather uniquely for the cozy MMO space, <em>Spirit Crossing </em>employs what Spry Fox calls a "friendship progression system", through which you'll gradually unlock features like proximity chat, two-player emotes, and gift-giving, plus more.</p><p>You'll be able to check out <em>Spirit Crossing </em>when it launches on PC via Steam sometime next year. If you're a Netflix member, then you can also enjoy it on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.SpiritCrossing&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and iOS right now at no extra cost.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-solix-2000w-power-station-goes-super-low-on-amazon-winter-blackout-season-just-got-less-scary-2000651723</link>
            <guid>1377826</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker made a name for itself by making reliable chargers and power banks. Now, though, the company has moved into portable power stations that are strong enough to compete with well-known brands like EcoFlow and Jackery. The <strong>Solix C1000 (gen 2)</strong> can provide 2,000W of continuous power and 3,000W of peak power which is more than the first generation model (which could only provide 1,800W).</p>
<p>The original version is now $436 instead of its usual $799, but the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">Gen 2 is actually cheaper at $371 instead of $549 which makes it the better deal even though it has more power</a>. The Solix C1000 Gen 2 is the <strong>best portable power stations you can buy</strong> on Amazon right now and no other competitor offers a better price-to-wattage ratio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power Output That Can Handle Real Appliances in the Home</h2>
<p>The 2,000-watt continuous output means you can run big appliances that cheaper power stations can’t handle, like <strong>full-size refrigerators, microwave ovens, power tools, and space heaters</strong>. The 3,000-watt surge capacity kicks in when devices need more power to start up: This is important because many motors and compressors use a lot more power in those first few seconds than they do when they’re running normally. This extra space makes sure that your refrigerator doesn’t trip the station when the compressor turns on and that your circular saw doesn’t stop working when you hit a knot in the wood.</p>
<p>The LiFePO4 battery has 1,024 watt-hours of energy, which is<strong> enough to keep a normal refrigerator running for 12 to 15 hours during a power outage</strong> or power a laptop for several full workdays when you’re off-grid.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry has a lot of advantages over the lithium-ion cells found in cheaper batteries. For example, they last longer and can be charged more times before their capacity starts to drop. These batteries also work better in extreme temperatures than regular lithium-ion batteries as they can keep working in the cold when other power stations would fail. Anker says this <strong>battery can be charged more than 3,000 times before its capacity drops to 80%</strong>&nbsp;which means you could use it regularly for years before you notice any significant wear and tear.</p>
<p>The <strong>ability to charge quickly in 49 minutes</strong> sounds too good to be true, but you’ll see how much it changes the game when you use it. Plugging the Solix C1000 into a wall outlet during lunch will charge it all the way up before you go outside to work or camp for the afternoon. This quick recharge means that you don’t have to charge it overnight like older portable power stations did which makes it much more useful for last-minute trips or emergencies when you need power right away. Solar charging makes the station even more flexible, but you’ll have to buy solar panels separately because they don’t come with the unit.</p>



<p>There are a lot of ways to connect to different devices. For example,<strong> there are AC outlets for regular household appliances, USB-C ports for laptops and phones, USB-A ports for older devices, and a 12V car outlet for car accessories</strong>. The LCD screen shows the current power draw, the percentage of battery life left, and the estimated runtime based on how you’re using it right now. This lets you make smart decisions about how much power you use.</p>
<p>When you think about what you’re actually getting for $371, a portable power station is a great deal. The original Solix C1000 was a good deal at $436, but <strong>the Gen 2 is even better because it costs less and has more power</strong> – and this is one of those rare times when the newer model costs less than the older one.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-back-to-back-releases/</link>
            <guid>1377823</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has announced that moving forward, it will no longer have back-to-back releases of Call of Duty’s subfranchises like Modern Warfare and Black Ops.</p>



<p>The news came as part of a new update from Activision, which acknowledged that the franchise has recently failed to meet some players’ expectations. The admission comes following what has been described to Insider Gaming from sources as a “rough launch” for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>“We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward,” the blog post read.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-stop-being-annual">Will Call of Duty Stop Being Annual?</h2>



<p>Despite Activision’s admission and realisation that Call of Duty has failed to meet some players’ expectations, they have pretty much said that annual releases will continue moving forward, which will provide fans with an “absolutely unique experience each and every year.”</p>



<p>It’s said that those plans will not be shared today but will be “when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> concludes with the following message,</p>



<p>“To&nbsp;be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams. We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.&nbsp;“</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision’s admission? Do you think Call of Duty should stop doing annual releases altogether? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering Reveals 38 Marvel Super Hero Cards Including Hulk, Doctor Doom, And Cap]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-horn-greed-heroic-intervention-2000651812</link>
            <guid>1377802</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Marvel Super Heroes set arrives next June, just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><em>Avengers</em> to return to theaters and <em>Doomsday</em></a> to debut at the end of the year. But the <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">licensed Universes Beyond expansions</a> have been at their best when they add more flavor to the trading card game rather than just lean on it for publicity. On Tuesday, Wizards of the Coast gave fans a taste of what to expect from the latest comic-book-inspired set, from Incredible Hulk card art to new Captain America card mechanics.</p> <p>The company teased 38 new cards on its <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/marvel-super-heroes-preview-prologue">latest WeeklyMTG show</a>. There’s plenty of Legendary Creatures, some neat spells, and lots of really nifty art. There’s Captain America, a 3/2 white creature with a shield counter that protects it from one instance of damage. There’s Bruce Banner, a 1/1 blue who can transform into the Hulk with an Enrage condition that gives him a +1/+1 counter when damaged and a second attack phase.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651829">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000651830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651830"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651830">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>And then there’s Doctor Doom, a 3/3 black creature that enters with Doombot tokens, lets players draw a card and take damage at the end of their turn, and is indestructible while an artifact creature or Plan is on the field. Wizards also revealed a notable reprint of Heroic Intervention, with the effect of “Permanents you control gain hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.” The set has a Horn of Greed, too, with the perfect Doctor Doom “toot” art.</p>

 <p>While the reprints each have callbacks to some classic Marvel comic book art, my favorite-looking cards so far are the full-art variants of Widow-Making Infiltrator, Dig Through Time, and Elektra, Deadly Assassin. And for all your Saga nerds out there, we have World War Hulk, which ends with doubling a creature’s power and toughness and giving it trample, and The Coming of Galactus, which culminates in a 16/16 black Elder Alien with flying, trample, and “Whenever Galactus attacks, destroy target land.”</p> <p>I wasn’t too impressed with the Marvel set when it was initially revealed earlier this year. Coming right after Spider-Man and in the midst of a glut of other Universes Beyond crossovers, it seemed likely to be another property stretched thin and rushed out to keep the release calendar rolling. These initial card reveals look promising, though. I’m intrigued. Maybe I wasn’t as burnt out on Marvel as I thought. I might just have to chase Galactus after all.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-pro-3-return-to-black-friday-record-low-on-amazon-apple-store-still-charges-full-price-2000651653</link>
            <guid>1377799</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never puts its newest products on sale, especially not something as new as the AirPods Pro 3 which came out just a few months ago. But Amazon has taken matters into its own hands and cut prices on almost all of Apple’s products right before Christmas. For instance, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">you can get these third-generation AirPods Pro for $219 instead of the usual $249</a> which is the same price as the lowest price we saw on Black Friday. You might be tempted to buy the older AirPods Pro 2 because they are cheaper, but this newer model has so many more features powered by Apple Intelligence that if you don’t upgrade, you’ll miss out on features that change the way you use wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Efficient Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Apple says that the <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already-great Pro 2 model</strong> – and it means that subway rumble, airplane engine drone, and coffee shop chatter almost completely disappear. The active noise cancellation changes in real time based on the shape of your ear canal and the fit of the ear tips and keeps changing to keep out as much outside noise as possible. The <strong>box now comes with five different ear tip sizes</strong> instead of the three it used to have to make sure you can find a snug fit that makes the best seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>The audio architecture was completely changed to focus on what Apple calls <em>“three-dimensional sound,”</em> which makes music feel like it’s happening around you instead of inside your head. Bass hits with more depth and power without drowning out the midrange, and high frequencies give you clear detail that lets you hear each instrument in a complicated arrangement. The vocals are very clear and present, putting the singers right in front of you in the soundstage. When you turn your head, <strong>spatial audio with dynamic head tracking</strong> keeps sound sources anchored to your iPhone or iPad which makes for an immersive experience that is especially fun when watching movies or playing games.</p>



<p>One of the most useful new features of the AirPods Pro 3 is heart rate sensing: It turns your earbuds into workout partners that <strong>can track your heart rate and calorie burn for 50 different types of exercise</strong>. This information syncs with the Activity app on your iPhone, adding to your Move ring and step count. It also gives you useful information through the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p><em>Live Translation</em> uses Apple Intelligence to process speech and give instant translations that sound natural: This breaks down language barriers in real-time conversations. Think about going to another country and being able to talk to people there without having to pull out your phone or look for a translation app: The feature works with many languages and gets better as Apple Intelligence learns from more interactions. Active Hearing Protection keeps an eye on the noise levels in your environment all the time and it lowers the volume when you’re around sounds that could hurt your ears, like construction work, concerts, or loud traffic.</p>



<p>The Hearing Aid feature uses the great fit and noise processing to work as a clinical-grade hearing aid, complete with automatic Conversation Boost to boost speech frequencies. You can even use your iPhone and AirPods Pro 3 to take a hearing test at home which will give you personalized audio profiles that make listening to music, calls, and media more enjoyable. With active noise cancellation turned on, the battery lasts for eight hours and with Transparency mode and hearing aid functionality turned on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but Apple products don’t usually go on sale this soon after they come out, so this price is very good by Apple’s standards. You can get flagship earbuds at a lower price before the holiday shopping season ends because Amazon matched the Black Friday record low in mid-December. You’re buying earbuds that work as fitness trackers, hearing aids, translation devices, and high-end audio equipment all in one package which makes the price worth it even before the discount is taken into account.</p>

Though Sanderson is largely known as a fantasy author, Tailored Realities skews more toward science fiction. The biggest story is <strong>Moment Zero</strong>, a brand-new novel of roughly 200 pages. This apocalyptic sci-fi story follows two police officers who, while investigating a disappearance, find themselves in an alternate dimension filled with zombies and vampires.</p><p>Moment Zero is one of two alternate-reality sci-fi novellas included in Tailored Realities.

Originally published in 2015, Perfect State follows a god-like ruler's first date with a goddess-like ruler of a different world. The highly rated novella is roughly 90 pages.</p><p>None of the stories take place in Sanderson's Cosmere--the shared universe of The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn--but two shorter novellas are connected to his popular YA franchises. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defending-Elysium-Cytoverse-Novella-Skyward-ebook/dp/B09M3ZV4Y1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Defending Elysium</a> is a prequel to Sanderson's science fiction series Skyward. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mitosis-Reckoners-Story-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B00GQAMAK6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mitosis</a> is a side story that takes place between the first and second books in the superhero-action series The Reckoners.</p><p>The novellas are joined by five short stories, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Firstborn-Tor-Com-Original-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B003V4B4GQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Firstborn"</a> and <strong>"Dreamer,"</strong> which follows deceased gamers who take control of living humans to play high stakes games.</p><p><strong>Tailored Realities Stories:</strong></p><ul><li>Moment Zero: A Novella</li><li>Snapshot: A Novella</li><li>Perfect State: A Novella</li><li>Defending Elysium: A Novella (Skyward)</li><li>Mitosis: A Novella (Reckoners)</li><li>Firstborn</li><li>Brain Dump</li><li>Probability Approaching Zero</li><li>Dreamer</li><li>I Hate Dragons</li></ul></div>                      </div><h2>Brandon Sanderson: Skyward and Reckoners Box Set Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4619994-brandonsandersonskyward.png" data-ref-id="1300-4619994" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4619994-brandonsandersonskyward.png" data-ref-id="1300-4619994"></a><figcaption>Brandon Sanderson Skyward and Reckoners Box Sets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4619994-brandonsandersonskyward.png"></figure><p>If you haven't read Reckoners or Skyward, Amazon has deals on box sets for both series.

It's for an image, and it looks like this:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565fmr7unsbd5jsl4ttwopcumgrig-1765310322978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now compare that to the big symbol at the center of the statue:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, that's definitely the same symbol, so we're in the right place. Now, how do we know it's Divinity? Let's look at <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next trademark registered at the same time by the same company</a>, simply for "Divinity", with a logo attached.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565ezczz2ayw37cfdb5x3ebc6mn4y-1765310040065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're getting somewhere! It's not exact, but it's quite comparable to past Divinity: Original Sin logos:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1765310670854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1-1765310692505.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And even closer to the older Divinity games, slashed through "i" and all.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-divine-divinity-1-1765312473079.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-beyond-divinity-1765312488383.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, maybe it's all just a big coincidence? Sure, I guess. But there's one more clue. All three trademarks were filed by Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte, a legal firm that, among other things, has previously filed trademarks for Larian Studios, including <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">past Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that's pretty cut and dry. But what about that third trademark? This is where things get a bit more mysterious. This trademark is also just for an image, this one here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565gq2lboaqot2jsa6vx2cxeqx22a-1765310920328.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What's that? I have no idea. But it's probably related, given it was filed on the same day by the same firm and is in a similar style to the other trademarks. Maybe we'll find out on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, this seems to be for a new Divinity...NOT a Divinity: Original Sin game. Director of publishing at Larian Studios Michael Douse was on Twitter/X today shutting down any rumors of a Divinity: Original Sin 3, but his language was very specific:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If this is indeed Divinity, that's good news for Larian fans, as Divinity: Original Sin 2 was fantastic. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/divinity-original-sin-2-review">gave it a 9.6/10</a>, saying, "Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 3 is Larian's most recent work, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">got an impressive 10/10 from us</a>. We said, "I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some may have clamored for Larian to immediately get to work on DLC or Baldur's Gate 4, Larian explicitly said over a year ago that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">wouldn't be continuing with another D&amp;D game</a>. However, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029">teasing</a> a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">new project</a> for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-baldurs-gate-3-turns-2-larian-boss-swen-vincke-talks-about-the-studios-next-game-and-asks-fans-for-their-patience-well-need-a-bit-of-time-to-make-it-all-work">while now</a>, and based on past timelines, this year's Game Awards would be a perfect time for an unveiling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[McDonalds Got Bullied So Badly It Deleted Its AI Christmas Ad]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791</link>
            <guid>1377751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this month, McDonald’s Netherlands put out an ugly and lifeless Christmas commercial that was created using AI generation tools. Over the weekend, after the ad spot went viral online for all the wrong reasons, the fast-food chain deleted it.</p> <p>Recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/coca-cola-ai-tv-commerical-ad-coke-generated-holiday-1851700865">McDonald’s followed in the footsteps of Coca-Cola</a> and released <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1998108853444169807">a new AI-generated advertisement</a> just in time for the holiday season. The ad features numerous AI-generated scenes of people dealing with all the horrible, annoying, and not-so-great moments that can happen during this time of year. It’s genuinely a funny little idea for an ad, but it’s hard to watch and enjoy when it’s so clearly AI-generated.</p>

 <p>This is normally the part where I’d embed the ad via an official source, like the McDonald’s YouTube account. But, <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial">as spotted by <em>Futurism</em></a>, I can’t do that because the fast food company has seemingly removed it entirely from the internet, a step it took after previously shutting down comments on the ad. So here’s a reupload of it via the YouTube channel CongenAI:</p>

  <p>Perhaps the wildest part of all of this is that the studio behind the awful-looking AI ad claimed that it crunched for weeks to produce this slop. Seriously. <a href="https://80.lv/articles/mcdonald-s-unveils-an-ai-generated-christmas-ad-that-somehow-looks-worse-than-coca-cola-s">Here’s the full statement</a> from the studio, <a href="https://lbbonline.com/news/McDonalds-Netherlands-AI-Terrible-Truth-of-December">Sweetshop</a>, which has also since been deleted:</p> <blockquote><p>“For seven weeks, we hardly slept, with up to 10 of our in-house AI and post specialists at The Gardening Club working in lockstep with the directors. Every shot travelled through a rigorously engineered toolchain: real Google Earth plates, advanced style-transfer, pixel-level photo repair, custom LoRAs, control nets, bespoke ComfyUI graphs, and thousands upon thousands of tightly steered iterations.</p> <p>Then came compositing, lighting balance, physics corrections, artefact removal, and final finishing in Flame. We generated what felt like dailies – thousands of takes – then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production. This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film. And here’s the thing I wish more people understood: magic isn’t the technology. The magic is the team behind it, people who pushed, questioned, experimented, swore at broken models, solved impossible problems, and refused to stop until every frame felt cinematic.</p> <p>I don’t see this spot as a novelty or a cute seasonal experiment. To me, it’s evidence of something much bigger: that when craft and technology meet with intention, they can create work that feels genuinely cinematic. So no – AI didn’t make this film. We did.”</p></blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it would be easier and better to just have a camera crew and a director film some actors, maybe add some stock footage in, and not make something horrible in a way that sounds both tedious and terrible. But I’m just old-fashioned like that, I guess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Current Plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3, Larian Says]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/</link>
            <guid>1377748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Divinity series has been the talk of the town lately after it was uncovered that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue for The Game Awards</a> could be related to the 23-year-old franchise. One such hope from fans is that the announcement, should it be true, is that Divinity: Original Sin 3 is on the way.</p>



<p>If you’re one of those fans hoping for that, you may want to sit down.</p>







<p>While answering fan questions on social media, Laraian Studio’s head of publishing Michael Douse poured some sand on that fire—yes, sand is good to put out small fires. </p>



<p>In a response to <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan asking</a>, “Divinity Original Sin 3 when???”, Douse said there are no current plans for the game. However, he didn’t say there weren’t any plans for Divinity as a whole.</p>



<p><strong>“There aren’t currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,”</strong> he said. </p>







<p>While the new announcement may not be for Divinity: Original Sin 3, there remains plenty of smoke that Divinity will have a major presence at Thursday’s The Game Awards. Maybe even a new game titled something completely different, but in the series.</p>



<p>One rumor also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">making the rounds</a> is that Larian is set to announce Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition for PlayStation 5 and, possibly, Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Whether that’s the only announcement or something even bigger is planned, it feels like fans of Larian Studios will have something to talk about soon enough. </p>



<p>What do you think the future of Divinity is? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
