The 1,157-piece playset is the largest Donkey Kong expansion in the Lego Super Mario lineup. This Lego set originally retailed for $110, so you're saving almost 50% right now.</p><p>It also might be your last opportunity to buy it from a major retailer. The set is currently marked as "retiring soon" on the Lego Store, so once major retailers are out of stock, Diddy Kong's Mine Cart ride is gone for good. Amazon was matching this deal but already sold out, so Donkey Kong fans should grab this deal fast.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6425894-Super-Mario-Dry-Bowser-Castle-Battle-Expansion-Set-1321-pcs%2F1102790062%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-110-donkey-kong-lego-set-is-only-58-at-walmart%2F1100-6524893%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSRD1SK5?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> also have the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSRD1SK5?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dry Bowser Battle Lego Set for $80, down from $110</a>.

This card has a read speed of up to 100MB/s, so it's not as fast as the Ultra either.

			<p>Video game publisher tinyBuild has teamed up with indie developer Fire &amp; Frost Studios to reveal their upcoming title Of Ash and Steel, an immersive third-person RPG which is inspired by old-school exploration and storytelling. This title is set to release in 2025 on PC via Steam. Of Ash and Steel draws inspiration from classic fantasy RPGs, offering a nostalgic experience that captures the old-school spirit of adventure, combining it with modern graphics and designs with expansive character progression and dynamic combat.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel takes you to the Kingdom of the Seven, where you work on honing your combat skills and creating alliances with those you find on your journey to survive in a harsh land. You start off as a lowly adventurer, but have a lot of potential to become a great hero that people won't be forgetting any time soon. Compared to a lot of RPGs, Of Ash and Steel doesn't plan to hold your hand, as there are no quest markers that tell you where to go. Instead, the exploration is entirely up to you, and you have to rely on your instincts and curiosity to take you to where you need to go. Of course, along the way, you will find plenty of secrets, treasures, and side quests, which will provide you with a lot of content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYB0piWxULE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the announcement of the upcoming RPG, a five-minute trailer has been released on the tinyBuild YouTube channel, which showcases the graphics, some of the characters you'll meet along the way, and most importantly, the world in which you'll be thrown.</p>
<p>As you explore the Kingdom of the Seven, you'll get to experience an immersive atmosphere with a dynamic weather system, a suited soundtrack, and lots of rewards for those who choose to explore the vast wilderness ahead of them. If you're looking for the medieval RPG experience, the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with when the game is set to release in 2025.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is the first game to be released by Fire &amp; Frost Studios, an indie studio that describes itself as "a small studio by choice... of enthusiasts with burning hearts and cool heads."</p>
<p>When it comes to teaming up with publishers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-acquires-banner-saga-versus-evil-and-qa-testing-firm-red-cerberus/">tinyBuild is one of the most well-known publishers</a> in the indie world, as they are responsible for releasing games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and SpeedRunners, with some of their most recent games being Kingmakers and SAND.</p>

And now, because of a moon in a screenshot, <em>GTA </em>superfans are convinced that on November 22, we’ll either get the next trailer or an announcement from Rockstar of when to expect.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 1, Rockstar Games provided an update</a></span> on<em> GTA Online</em>’s next major patch, which is set to arrive in December. The tweet contained a screenshot of someone sitting on a car and looking at a building at night. And in the sky above is the moon. Seems like a fairly mundane, boring image. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But one fan on Reddit</a></span> pointed out that the moon seen in the screenshot was in its waning gibbous phase. After some additional research, the community decided that on November 22, something will (<em>probably</em>) happen. </p><p>What exactly are they predicting? Well, that remains to be seen, with some suggesting a new trailer, others a release date announcement, and others a teaser for a future trailer. <br></p><p>This whole moon theory popped up not long after the tweet was published, but has continued to pick up support and momentum online as we get closer and closer to November 22. At first, this was a fringe theory, but now it’s all <em>GTA</em> fans can talk about at the moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I even saw one popular account suggest</a></span> that, because the first trailer contained a Tom Petty song off the album “Full Moon Fever,” this moon theory was more plausible. </p><p>Here’s the wild part: This isn’t the first time the Rockstar community has tried to predict the future using the phases of the moon as seen in a tweet. Last year, fans did the same thing, and guess what...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> they ended up being right in the end</a></span>! Two months before the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer was announced, Rockstar shared an image with the moon in it, with the phase pictured arriving on December 1. And weeks later, on December 1, Rockstar teased the December 5 release date for the first <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer. Hmmmm. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> arrives in Fall 2025</a></span> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And, if all this is to be believed, we might be only a few days away from a new trailer for the highly anticipated open-world game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because the event changed its rules this year to allow DLC to be considered alongside full, standalone games. It seemed obvious that the loophole was added to give FromSoftware’s latest release a shot at recognition, and not undeservedly so. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has received almost universal acclaim. At its most reductive, it’s just more <em>Elden Ring</em>, but that still puts it head-and-shoulders above much of the competition.</p><p>At the same time, there are a bunch of other games that could have taken that nomination slot and added something newer and more interesting to the mix. Plus, it’ll be a bit weird if <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> wins and a bunch of people run out to play 2024’s GOTY, only to realize they need to play dozens of hours of a different game and also beat two of its toughest bosses. Maybe a better solution is just to give expansions their own category, especially as they become more and more frequent. <em>Factorio</em>’s <em>Space Age</em> DLC, for instance, just came out and reinvents a game that was already one of the best resource management sims around. —Ethan Gach </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-recommend-id="image://55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Helldivers stand triumphant on a hill.

Arrowhead Game Studios’ coop alien shooter was more than just a great game, it was an entire phenomenon, taking over Tiktok and even convincing normie friends of mine who haven’t played games in ages to hop in. While it’s on the lower end of the Metacritic spectrum for a GOTY winner (at 82), it’s one of the fresher and more innovative games of the decade so far.</p><p>The Game Awards jury didn’t agree, however. And based on years past, perhaps no standout game of 2024 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had more going against it</a></span> for a GOTY nomination than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s a multiplayer game with no story-driven campaign, open world, or RPG systems to speak of. It didn’t have the blockbuster production chops to make up for it either, unlike 2016’s <em>Titanfall 2</em> which snuck into the category even before it was expanded to six entrants. Perhaps to make up for <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s snub, it’s in the running for best ongoing game despite not even being a year old yet. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-recommend-id="image://b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cards on a board deal combo points.

Some great reviews here, positive chatter on social media there. Eventually, it had people everywhere hooked. Then it came to mobile and everyone kept playing its compulsive mix of roguelike deckbuilding and high-score arcade chase. The mix of playing card combos and<em> Diablo</em>-style buildcrafting is nominated across five different categories, including best game, best indie game, and best mobile game.</p><p>Its total number of nominations is equal to that of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and one ahead of<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, and behind only <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which each have seven. It still seems like a long-shot for the best game win—my guess is that it and <em>Animal Well </em>split the best indie and best debut indie categories—but it’s an impressive showing for a game that wasn’t even on anyone’s radar until it blew up this year. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-recommend-id="image://70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dragon Age heroes confront a monster.

We here at <em>Kotaku </em>really like it. I’m currently in the middle of a 40+ hour playthrough and I’m loving it. Sure, it’s not perfect and some might miss the darker tone of the older <em>Dragon Age</em> games, but what’s here is a very good RPG that expertly balances combat, exploration, and narrative.</p><p>And yet, <em>Veilguard </em>only got one nomination at this year’s Game Awards. The new RPG from Bioware was nominated for “Innovation In Accessibility,” a very important category, and the devs should be proud. Still, it’s a bit wild that <em>Veilguard </em>failed to receive any other nominations at this year’s Game Awards. Perhaps the game was too new and too big, and so too few jurors had gotten a chance to finish it and vote for it. Or maybe it had some support, but it was too divisive to get enough votes in any one category. It’s a shame that one of the best BioWare RPGs in years won’t have a chance to win in the RPG category, yet a DLC for <em>Elden Ring</em> is in there. Strange year. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="255c34c407ef6ab9e6891fe1070f8acd" data-recommend-id="image://255c34c407ef6ab9e6891fe1070f8acd" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Knuckles drinks coffee on a porch.

One of the best horror games in years.</p><p>Sure, the remake was not as impactful as the OG game, but they’re different enough that the new<em> Silent Hill 2</em> feels more like an adaption of the source material that’s worth experiencing in its own right, and not a replacement for the original classic.

It has a higher Metacritic rating than every other game in the category, including <em>WWE 2K24 </em>and <em>F1 24</em>, even if it has far fewer overall reviews than those games. In the end, there’s probably just much less overall interest in a simulation of an American college sport among the Game Awards’ global jury pool. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As someone still actively playing Gray Zone Warfare as a sherpa for new players, I am excited and eager to try out the upcoming update. I’m certainly not alone. Most players can’t wait to return, but they want quality-of-life tweaks and AI improvements before returning. I can’t blame anyone, especially when helicopter wait times prove formidable. But this new Gray Zone Warfare update should change everything!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-release">When Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Release?</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major update</a>—0.2 Night Ops—is out on <strong>November 27</strong>. We’re many months out since release, with the game launching in Early Access on April 30. Most players finished the entire storyline and all available quests within the first month of the game’s lifespan and have since eagerly awaited more or moved on to a different tactical shooter. A few of us continue playing, repeatedly running the same tasks and points of interest.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gray Zone Warfare: Night Ops Release Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTKvks7gUzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This is a major game update, and alongside countless fixes for the AI and additional content, like weapons, tasks, and night operations gear, there’s a wipe. Essentially, this means you’ll lose all your current progress and equipment, resetting to zero alongside everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-include">What Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Include?</h2>



<p>The next major update for Gray Zone Warfare, dubbed Night Ops, focuses primarily on resolving many of the community’s notable issues with the gameplay experience, namely helicopter wait times and AI one-shotting everything in sight. However, it’s not without significant content additions. The update expands the core gameplay with a day and night cycle, night vision optics, IR laser sights, canted sights, new weapons, and tasks. Here’s an overview of what’s to come:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle</strong>: A 2:1 ratio with three hours of real-time gameplay making up a single day in Lamang.</li>



<li><strong>Exterior and Interior Lighting</strong>: In addition to NVGs, you can activate lamps, light barrels, and candles and illuminate or snuff out the light in your environment to gain an advantage.</li>



<li><strong>New Missions</strong>: This update features 22 tasks across the various vendors, with some designed specifically for nighttime.</li>



<li><strong>AI Improvements</strong>: AI will no longer one-shot players; they now adapt to their surroundings, taking cover and hiding in the tall grass, and will pose unique challenges by patrolling or remaining indoors at night.</li>



<li><strong>New Equipment</strong>: Night vision goggles, flashlights, laser sights, and new weapon customization attachments enter the fray.</li>



<li><strong>New Weapons</strong>: MP5, AKS-74U, and various modern AK variants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’ll see high-value loot, in-game economy alterations, reduced landing zone times, an aim-down-sight toggle option, enhanced progression systems, and more!</p>

<p>Do you need a bit more GZW in your life? Me too! Thankfully, according to the game’s roadmap, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three years of content updates</a> are coming!</p>

This guide will cover how to use Sonic Sway as well as the best way to practice it.</p><h2 id="h45389"><a id="perform"></a>How to Perform Sonic Sway</h2><figure id="" data-id="ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-recommend-id="image://ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-recommend-id="image://ad01672c14d14eb865e3931b03f02334" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trunks turns into a blur as he dodges Super Buu’s attacks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>A Sonic Sway is executed when you press the Perception button right as an enemy’s melee rush attack lands.</strong> Those on the Standard Control scheme will need to press B/Circle for Xbox and PlayStation. Meanwhile, Classic Controls use B+Y/Circle+Triangle for your system of choice.</p><p>Successfully performing Sonic Sway will cause a short animation of your character swiftly dodging a flurry of punches and kicks from the opponent as their Ki is depleted by one bar. The animation then ends with a powerful counter hit that sends the opponent a short distance away. Unless they’re in a corner, they will likely be launched too far away to start your own rush chain. However, you can follow up with vanishing attacks and then combo into smashes or even a rush super.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>Aside from Sonic Sway only being able to counter rush chains, the biggest thing to stress here is the precise timing required. <strong>Sonic Sway will only come out if you press the button(s) right as an attack hits, while Super Perception comes out right before the attack hits</strong>. It’s very easy to keep performing the latter when trying to nail the timing for the former. Although both can be helpful, Super Perception does cost one skill count each time you use it.</p><p>Another important similarity to Super Perception is that <strong>you’ll want to use Sonic Sway while blocking</strong>. It is possible to immediately counter the first hit from a rush chain, but that will require some crazy reaction time and a lot of knowledge of the character you’re fighting. The general instability of the online mode will only make that more difficult too. That’s why I recommend blocking an opponent’s rush chain so you can better see the rhythm of their attacks and try to counter them.</p><h2 id="h45390"><a id="practice"></a>The Best Way to Practice Sonic Sway</h2><figure id="" data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pulling off a successful Sonic Sway is complicated further by the large roster size and differences in attack speed.

The goal is to set up a CPU that only uses rush melee attacks to help you perfect the timing. Here are the steps to make the perfect Sonic Sway practice buddy in Training Mode.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pick a Character you want to practice against.</li><li>After you’re loaded in, pause and head into Training Settings.</li><li>Under Gauge Settings, turn your health to Maximum. You’re going to be taking a lot of punches and kicks to the face, so it’s best to have health to spare.</li><li>Scroll down a bit under Gauge Settings and set the opponent’s Ki to Minimum. The CPU likes to switch things up a bit now and then. This will prevent them from throwing out Ki blasts or charging for Ki.</li><li>Under Opponent Settings, set the strategy to either Rush Attacks or Rush Chains.</li></ul><p>This approach will ensure the CPU only uses Rush Chains against you. Sometimes the training dummy will get a little stuck, so you might need to throw out a Ki blast or a couple of punches to get it back in the rhythm. Just remember to go back to blocking as soon as you can. Once you feel comfortable landing it, try switching to a different character to practice against.</p><hr><p>Sonic Sway might be the hardest defense mechanic to use in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but the potential rewards are more than worth the trouble. Turning the tide on your opponent’s offense and wasting a whole bar of their Ki is amazing, especially when it doesn’t cost you any resources such as Ki or a Skill Count. Your character turning into a motion blur as they dodge attacks is also just a cool thing to see.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/newell-says-he-was-stumped-on-how-to-finish-half-life-2-episode-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Despite the new weapons and mechanics that were already in the works for <em>Episode 3</em>, many developers quoted in the documentary cite a kind of fatigue that had set in after so much time and effort focused on a single franchise. "A lot of us had been doing <em>Half-Life</em> for eight-plus years" designer and composer Kelly Bailey noted.</p>
<p>That lengthy focus on a single franchise helps explain why some Valve developers were eager to work on anything else by that time in their careers. "I think everybody that worked on <em>Half-Life</em> misses working on that thing," Engineer Scott Dalton said. "But it's also hard not to be like, 'Man, I've kind of seen every way that you can fight an Antlion,' or whatever. And so you wanna get some space away from it until you can come back to it with fresh eyes."</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>After the first two <em>Half-Life 2</em> episodes were received less well than the base game itself, many developers cited in the documentary also said they felt pressure to go "much bigger" for <em>Episode 3</em>. Living up to that pressure, and doing justice to the fan expectations for the conclusion of the three-episode saga, proved to be too much for the team.</p>
<p>"You can’t get lazy and say, 'Oh, we’re moving the story forward,' Valve co-founder Gabe Newell said of the pressure. "That’s copping out of your obligation to gamers, right? Yes, of course they love the story. They love many, many aspects of it. But sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... you know, we could’ve shipped it, like, it wouldn’t have been that hard.</p>
<p>"You know, the failure was—my personal failure was being stumped," Newell continued. "Like, I couldn’t figure out why doing <em>Episode 3</em> was pushing anything forward."</p>

                <p>Pokemon players will soon have a chance to add a shiny legendary Pokemon to their collections. Starting December 19, shiny Rayquaza will appear as a special Tera Raid boss in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>.</p><p>Once the event is underway, players will be able to encounter shiny Rayquaza in five-star Tera Raids across the Paldea region. This particular Rayquaza will be a dragon Tera type, making it vulnerable to ice, fairy, and other dragon Pokemon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxydjASgrI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QmxydjASgrI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like other special raid bosses, shiny Rayquaza can only be caught once per save file.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within seconds of left-leaning pundits calling for a “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/why-a-liberal-joe-rogan-will-never-exist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liberal Joe Rogan</a>” the day after Trump’s reelection, the idea had already become a meme. At this point, posts deriding the notion of the massively-popular podcast host, but blue, are at least as numerous as those sincerely endorsing it. The reason is clear: Joe Rogan – the man and the cultural phenomenon – is not something you can simply grow in a tube, though he does look like a homunculus. But these cries elide a more salient point: There is already a left-leaning content creator ecosystem, and the Democratic establishment chooses to ignore large swathes of it.</p><p>For the moment, Democrats remain married to networks like MSNBC and CNN, as well as papers like The New York Times, places that will parrot the comforting lie that Kamala Harris lost because her campaign – which went hard on topics like border control and a “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/08/27/kamala-harris-dnc-military-lethal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lethal</a>” military while failing to take strong stances on trans rights and Palestine – was somehow too woke. News segments and columns suggesting that Dems surrendered former strongholds because they used words like “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/democrats-latino-vote-trump-00187991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latinx</a>” have left even mainstream names like Jon Stewart <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBJoj4XyFc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baffled</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, the internet’s most visible leftist content creator, has been beating a similar drum for the past couple weeks.</p><p>"This is a cynical right-wing framing instead of accurately addressing the real problems that the Democratic party has,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LrVByE6C78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piker recently said</a> while watching a CNN segment in which Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky claimed that the party faltered because of social justice jargon and alleged capitulation in the face of student protests at colleges like Columbia University. “And this is the only thing your parents are watching. Just remember that. The only thing your parents are watching is this kind of dumb, nonsensical bullshit that deflects the actual responsibility away and just looks at the problem and says ‘You know what it is? We just didn’t do more of the thing that actually made people annoyed with us.’"</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIBERALS ARE BLAMING THE LEFT ALREADY" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LrVByE6C78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Piker spent the months leading up to Harris’ defeat decrying her desperate entreaties to a nonexistent midpoint between Democrats and Republicans. He critiqued her failure to offer voters economic policies that might truly fire them up, especially after the campaign brought on <em>Crazy Taxi </em>expert and weirdo identifier Tim Walz, whose track record as governor of Minnesota suggested a focus on such issues. Piker pushed hard against the Democrats’ unwillingness to platform a Palestinian, so much so that it might have gotten him kicked out of his suite <a href="https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago</a>.</p><p>On election night, Piker streamed to over 300,000 concurrent viewers. This <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/democrats-compete-rogan-verse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put him in league</a> with right-wing heavy hitters like Dan Bongino, Steven Crowder, Charlie Kirk, and Tucker Carlson, pillars of an alternative media apparatus that the liberal commentariat now covets. But instead of holding up Piker as an example of what America’s left could use more of, they invented a hypothetical – an uncritical, subservient totem – in Liberal Joe Rogan. To other leftist content creators, this served as evidence that liberals do not understand Rogan or the non-hypothetical alt media ecosystem that already <em>does </em>exist.</p><p>"Joe Rogan is not a Ben Shapiro,” <a href="https://x.com/carolinekwan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caroline Kwan</a>, a leftist Twitch streamer who covers pop culture, told Aftermath. “He's not Charlie Kirk. You can say he's part of this manosphere that the Republican party has been courting in its election outreach, but Joe Rogan did not come into his success as a podcaster because he was talking about politics or because he was explicitly a conservative. ... Yes, he endorsed Trump, and yes, he certainly expresses opinions and beliefs that are very right-wing in nature, but he also believes in climate change. He's not a straight-up right-wing dude, and that's why people are drawn to him. They're drawn to the culture that Joe Rogan is part of, that he has created in talking about working out, talking about space, talking about being anti-establishment, expressing distrust of authority."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Joe Rogan is not a Ben Shapiro.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Admittedly, Rogan has moved <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelhobbes.bsky.social/post/3lb3m3kpbok2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely far to the right</a> in recent years, embracing numerous conspiracy theories as a result of covid-19 vaccines and lockdown measures. Still, as Kwan sees it, there are clear fissures in a right-wing media landscape that people on the outside looking in might be tempted to view as homogenous.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have the right-wing sphere of commentators and pundits like Ben Shapiro. Those guys are funded explicitly by right-wing mega-donors and corporations – the same that would be funding a Fox News,” she said. “They are explicitly ideological in their conservative politics, and they are news, but in a nontraditional format. They're podcasting. They're on YouTube. Then you have the group of, [for example], Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan and Theo Von, where they are not explicitly and totally political. It's something where they are having conversations with a wide range of people, from conspiracy theorists to Marianne Williamson to Donald Trump to some random dude off the street. It's an online culture of talking about anything and everything versus being an extension of a political party."</p><p>These less-political personalities helped the Republican party make inroads among low-propensity voters – those who participate in elections infrequently, if at all – to a degree that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/nx-s1-5188445/2024-election-polls-trump-kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polls failed to anticipate</a>. While the right-leaning, brain-pill-popping manscape is hardly the only reason such demographics made a rare cameo in voting booths, it’s hard to overstate the impact of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Von’s Trump interview</a>, which garnered nearly 15 million views on YouTube, or <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross’ livestream</a> with the then-freshly-traumatized septuagenarian, which peaked at 580,000 concurrent viewers – and both of which allowed viewers, many young and male, to see Trump in a new light. In the latter, Trump often appeared befuddled and out of place, but Ross’ approach made the encounter memorable, gifting Trump a Cybertruck with an image from his own attempted assassination on it. Moments like that outlive a hundred same-y stump speeches.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gov. Tim Walz Plays Crazy Taxi with AOC | Harris-Walz 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n9Gqa-0Cp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Harris, by comparison, played it safe with her online outreach. Yes, she scored the Charli XCX “<a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brat</a>” meme early on, but she ultimately dodged a Rogan appearance of her own <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-aide-joe-rogan-podcast-b2647076.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to fear of backlash</a> and instead went on less potentially-controversial shows like “Call Her Daddy,” an advice and comedy podcast, and “All The Smoke,” a podcast hosted by former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes. While those guest spots generated a few headlines, they did not meaningfully move the needle. In the final weeks before the election, Bernie Sanders, Tim Walz, and AOC all <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-crazy-taxi-aoc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made Twitch appearances</a> in support of Harris, but they again steered clear of any remotely-divisive personalities – though Sanders did at least <a href="https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn what a vtuber is</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This, former political candidate and current leftist politics streamer <a href="https://x.com/Mike_from_PA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael “Mike From PA” Beyer</a> told Aftermath, is the difference between how Democrats and Republicans approach content creators. Democrats desire deference; Republicans will go with whatever gets the job done. He used the example of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@harryjsisson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Sisson</a>, a 22-year-old self-described Democrat with 1.5 million followers on TikTok.</p><p>"[Sisson will] go and make that classic <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/soy-boy-face-soyjak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soy face</a> while standing in the same room as Kamala Harris, right? It's almost like 'Look at how she's our friend,'” Beyer told Aftermath. “They trade on access, and in exchange for access, they offer guerrilla marketing. It's a shill. They say the Democrats are perfect. They're gonna win, and we love them. They're so amazing. Isn't she a queen? There are a lot of Democrat partisans who will watch that, but they're watching for glimpses of Kamala Harris or whatever. The Republican side has less of that, believe it or not. Even the dumbest commentators on Newsmax are talking about issues and having opinions and disagreeing with Mitch McConnell. ... In the Republican party, populist discontent is the mainstream. In the Democratic party, that's excommunicable."</p><p>That’s not to say all Democratic politicians staunchly stick to the path of least resistance. AOC has collaborated with Piker, who criticizes the Democratic establishment nearly as much as he goes after Republicans, at various points – <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first in 2020</a> to the tune of hundreds of thousands of viewers, and a handful of times since (mostly recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjgJZmMtaA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>). Piker on his face appears to be a pure political commentator, more similar in focus, if not ideological bent, to Ben Shapiro or Charlie Kirk than Joe Rogan. But that, say other leftist content creators, is a fundamental misunderstanding of his appeal.</p><p>"He's charismatic, good looking, and he has all the nerd interests that Twitch viewers like,” said Beyer. “He's a cross-platform star. He has friendships with people who are not political. He's somebody who can span the whole area of Twitch, from gaming to IRL to activities to obviously commentary.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>In the Republican party, populist discontent is the mainstream. In the Democratic party, that's excommunicable.</p></blockquote></figure><p>People who’ve eschewed traditional media in favor of content creators aren’t just looking for information, opinions, or to have preconceived notions validated. They’re looking for aspirational figures – people they can try not just to think like, but <em>be </em>like. That, to some extent, is what a Joe Rogan or a Theo Von or, more regrettably, an Adin Ross offers. It’s also what viewers see in Piker, who posts pics and videos of his fits and his fitness progress in addition to streaming political commentary.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hasan, with his himbo aesthetic and working out and all that is very appealing to a lot of young viewers, a lot of young men who have said 'Yeah, I once upon a time was falling down the alt-right pipeline, and then I found Hasan,’” said Kwan. “‘And now I'm here.'"</p><p>Piker has also demonstrated a willingness to engage in lengthy conversations with right-leaning big-name friends (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukVFg1OlA0M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asmongold</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJ4O2EKGZw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faze Banks</a>, the latter of whom recently endorsed Trump) that are Rogan-like in vibe but the polar opposite in terms of Piker’s response to his collaborators’ ravings. While things do occasionally get heated, for the most part he listens to what they have to say and draws on a deep well of knowledge to gently push back while avoiding the argumentative fever pitch of a debate. This is the kind of thing <a href="https://linktr.ee/denimstv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denims</a>, another leftist political streamer, thinks the left needs more of.</p><p>"I think [condescension] is a problem that exists on the left,” Denims told Aftermath. “I think everybody who's on the left has known that it's a problem for the longest time. It's very hard to have positions that are left leaning and then educate on why they are the better positions to have without coming off like you're talking down to someone. … The common sense position on immigration would be 'Oh, just close all our borders.' But the reality is, that's not what's going to fix the problem, because that's not what the problem is. So now you have to explain what the problem is, the solution to it, and you have to do it all without being a condescending asshole."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ASKING FAZE BANKS WHY HES VOTING FOR TRUMP" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xe5d-AMbi_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>These characteristics, in addition to being in the right place at the right time years ago, have allowed Piker to grow beyond Twitch’s relatively narrow confines. In that regard, at least among leftist streamers, he stands alone. While the right counts among its ranks a whole cinematic universe of Crowder-sized politics yappers and has managed to lure over ostensibly apolitical figures like Rogan and Ross, the left boasts just one Piker – and “boasts” is probably overstating it considering how reluctant the establishment has been to embrace him.&nbsp;</p><p>Other leftist streamers – of which there is a growing faction – are vastly smaller. On a good day, Beyer is, as he put it, “between 10 and 25 percent of Hasan” in terms of viewership. Kwan, who is friends with Piker, voiced concern about being perceived as a “Hasan waiting room,” which is understandable given how many streamers go live early in the day and tend to wrap up just before Piker tends to log on in the afternoon. They are effectively feeding off his viewership, something Kwan wants to avoid for fear of cultivating a community that can’t grow on its own terms, that just trades the same viewers back and forth ad infinitum.</p><p>"My question is, are those just Hasan viewers?” Kwan said. “Will they drop you as soon as Hasan goes live, because Hasan is their guy?”</p><h2><strong>Money Talks</strong></h2><p>But why aren’t there more influencers with Piker’s size, reach, and most importantly, impact on the left? In part, it comes down to who the Democratic and Republican establishments choose to back.&nbsp;</p><p>"Part of the role of folks like myself is to critique power and present ideas on how to wield power more for the benefit of folks like us, working-class people,” <a href="https://x.com/Riverboatjack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack “Riverboatjack” Gardner</a>, a trans political streamer, told Aftermath. “That's just not really where the Democratic party has its goals right now. ... I think they are afraid of tapping into something that is too real, the kind of thing that Bernie Sanders tapped into in 2016. They are afraid of activating that base because it kind of ruins their ability to reach out to their big money donors, and they aren't bringing enough to the table on the merits of their own policy to actually back up that kind of shift in how to approach politics and communications."</p><p>Republicans are playing by different rules. Their content creators trade in outrage, misinformation, and conspiracy theories, which keeps their base riled up and ready to lash out. Democrats cold-shoulder criticisms and blame the far-left for defeats, while Republicans let their base drive party messaging, often seizing on social media trends and sending them up the chain from content creators to Fox News and Newsmax to politicians.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The amount of money in the right-wing influencer machine is insane – just completely out of control.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"The right wing has basically moved toward their YouTubers, which is a terrible thing for all of us,” <a href="https://jacobgeller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>, a YouTube video essayist whose videos often touch on political subjects, told Aftermath. “The right supports these people with the establishment. It is really hard to find the separation between what is politically acceptable and what is politically unacceptable and has to be said on a detached podcast, because they're all just one big group."</p><p>Piker grew organically on Twitch (albeit in part thanks to a significant fame boost granted by his tenure at The Young Turks, a prominent left-leaning news network on YouTube and Facebook, among others, headed up by his uncle, Cenk Ugyur) at a time when few sizable political streamers existed on the platform, and smaller streamers have since attempted to follow in his footsteps. Meanwhile, right-wing influencers on YouTube and other, less-niche platforms are often manufactured, sometimes to the tune of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/05/texas-fracking-billionaire-brothers-prageru-daily-wire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of dollars</a>. And where talking about politics – especially far-right politics – used to be a big no-no if influencers wanted sponsorships, brands are now more permissive (and, in the alternate brand universes of X, Kick, and Rumble, outright supportive), causing creators in sectors like wellness and lifestyle to <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/influencers-coming-out-trump-supporters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come out in full-throated support of Trump</a> following his reelection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"The amount of money in the right-wing influencer machine is insane – just completely out of control,” said Geller. “The left doesn't have that. You lose sponsors for talking about Palestine. With the funding some of these right-wing shows get, you could support 100 video essayists."</p><h2><strong>Citizens Divided</strong></h2><p>Overt political content is one piece of the puzzle, though. Liberal pundits seized on Joe Rogan in part because he’s representative of a tactic at which the right has proven ruthlessly adept: Trojan horsing talking points into nearly every imaginable arena, especially ones that appeal to disaffected young men.&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for example, video games. On <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms like Twitter and YouTube</a>, the past year has been defined by <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a growing, intensely conspiratorial anti-woke movement</a> in games, championed by creators like Asmongold who are first and foremost gamers rather than political commentators. Misinformation-laden rants against the inclusion of people of color or queer themes in games prime typically-apolitical viewers to receive similar messaging from the right – and to believe that if they just side with the party that’s offering a quick fix for what they’ve been told is society’s biggest problem, their video games will become great again. Asmongold himself recently completed the line between point A and B by going on <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an overtly racist rant about Palestinians</a>, which got him suspended from Twitch for two weeks.</p><figure><blockquote><p>How do you process enshittification? Do you think about abstract issues of economic production and means of production and rights? Or are you thinking 'Oh, there must be a cabal of people with bad intent who hate me'?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Despite all the misinformation, Beyer believes there’s a kernel of truth to gamers’ concerns – and that’s the problem.</p><p>"What's wrong with gaming right now is that it's owned by a few mega-conglomerates that buy up all studios, and they produce games that are by committee for the purpose of creating addictive loops of exploitative microtransactions, and the developers are put under extreme time crunches, and they're not given time to fully polish the game,” said Beyer. “You have a decline because [of] the imperative of making higher profits than the previous quarter. It recalls the enshittifcation of everything. And how do you process enshittification? Do you think about abstract issues of economic production and means of production and rights – and esoteric ideas about ownership and creativity? Or are you thinking 'Oh, there must be a cabal of people with bad intent who hate me'? We are more wired to look at a personified threat than we are a complex, multifaceted thought."&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a complex issue, one that requires time, effort, and research to untangle if you’re not taking the easy route of plopping down in front of a camera and saying what <em>feels </em>correct to your viewers, even if it’s not rooted in anything resembling observable reality. This is not to say that there aren’t content creators who push back against these corrosive lines of thought, both in video games and other artistic and cultural mediums. But they are, in multiple senses, outnumbered and outgunned.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Twilight | ContraPoints" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqloPw5wp48?start=8942&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the mid- and late-2010s, the conversation around “deradicalization” – that is, rewiring the worldviews of people who’d had their brains hijacked by the far-right’s alt media ecosystem – <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/contra-1.5273072/how-youtubers-are-deradicalizing-members-of-the-alt-right-1.5273079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">centered around YouTubers</a> like Natalie “Contrapoints” Wynn, who weaved political, social, and pop cultural criticism into lengthy video essays that explored topics like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Incels</a>” or, simply, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xxcKCGljY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Men</a>.” A whole scene for leftist video essays emerged, and it still exists. Arguably, there are now more YouTubers than ever posting left-leaning deep dives into games, movies, and TV shows, as well as politics. They just can’t compete with the ruthless efficiency of the far-right slop machine, which further benefits from algorithms that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/3/pgac137/6651695?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies have shown</a> tend to favor far-right content over less incendiary alternatives on the left.&nbsp;</p><p>In March of this year, Wynn released her most recent video, a meticulously-researched and written <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqloPw5wp48&amp;t=8942s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three-hour opus about the <em>Twilight </em>series</a> that touches on political ideas like sexual hierarchy and the current favored bogeyman of both Democrats and Republicans, identity. Meanwhile, Ben Shapiro has posted three videos a day nearly every day, which he does every week, like clockwork. You will not be surprised to learn that other far-right influencers employ a similar strategy, as do creators whose work appeals to right-leaning audiences, like Asmongold, who often cuts up recordings of his Twitch livestreams into four or five YouTube videos per day.&nbsp;</p><p>Leftist streamers like Piker can, to an extent, imitate this model, but not many people are capable of spending 8-10 hours per day talking about politics from an educated yet accessible leftist perspective. It takes a deceptive amount of work, not to mention a uniquely resilient personality.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It takes a long time to be correct, and it takes a very short time to be wrong.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"You have to have a very particular set of traits to be able to stream for the amount of time that it takes to be a streamer,” said Geller. “[And] it is exhausting being a full-time political operative in this kind of sphere. I started doing this thing because I love writing about art and video games, and I do really enjoy sometimes incorporating explicit politics into my writing. But if somebody told me this is what every video has to be, I think I would just burn out so much more quickly."</p><p>There’s also the issue of research. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SarahZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Z</a>, a video essayist who focuses on pop culture, internet history, and fandom, pointed to the example of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheGravelInstitute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gravel Institute</a>, a left-wing attempt at countering conservative advocacy channels like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/09/florida-oklahoma-prageru-propaganda-isnt-slowing-down?srsltid=AfmBOore-zflAxFWLKShajGJ7bB5CKBuEOtC0KRVd7zCeo0XjAcZWv2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notorious propaganda firehose PragerU</a>, which has over three million subscribers on YouTube and publishes multiple videos per day.</p><p>"As of now, [Gravel Institute has] under 400,000 subscribers, and they have not put out a video in over two years,” she said. “I don't actually think their videos were all bad. In fact, I thought that their documentary on Cambodia was quite well researched and well crafted, but that's also why it couldn't work. That's why it couldn't be the new PragerU. It was aesthetically similar in that it was bite-sized political content with cute animations, but unless you have massive amounts of money to start with, you can't simultaneously be an educational channel and a constantly-producing slop machine. If they wanted to produce content at the same rate as PragerU, they would have to produce content that's worse, at which point we're losing sight of our original goal."</p><p>"If you want a Fox News, a Joe Rogan, anything like that, you are asking for an infrastructure system that needs misinformation to succeed,” <a href="https://x.com/abughazalehkat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kat Abu</a>, who makes fun of conservatives from networks like Fox News <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on TikTok</a>, told Aftermath. “I don't think that's necessarily the [solution to the problem of right-wing media dominance]: making people <em>less </em>informed."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Analyzing Every Torture Scene in Call of Duty — All 46 of Them" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPiL3-CYzWk?start=364&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Geller believes this same principle applies to The Rogan Of It All.</p><p>“The reason that the right gets to have their Joe Rogans and their Ben Shapiros is because you can make an incredible amount of content when you're just saying words and never have to verify them with anything,” Geller, who <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-jacob-geller-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read a gargantuan book on torture</a> for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiL3-CYzWk&amp;t=364s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent video about <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, said. “It takes a long time to be correct, and it takes a very short time to be wrong. ... It's not that leftists never make things up, but it's almost part and parcel with being a right-wing influencer: You just get to go out and speculate on vaccines, whereas the left is not really held to that same standard, nor would leftists want it to be that way. Leftists love being critical of other leftists, and I think if big creators are out there truly just making shit up in the way that Joe Rogan does, they are not going to maintain a platform, because that's not what people are looking for."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>(Un) Friendly Fire</strong></h2><p>Left-leaning creators also operate in a more fragile ecosystem than right-wing ones. This is especially notable when it comes to conflicts: A little over a year ago, Piker and longtime YouTuber Ethan “H3H3” Klein hosted a regular podcast together. Now, following a series of disagreements over the conflation of anti-Israel sentiment with anti-Jewish sentiment, the show is on indefinite hiatus, and Klein has dedicated himself to Piker’s downfall, resulting in – among other things – <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several Arab streamers in Piker’s sphere getting suspended for a month</a> over spurious claims of antisemitism after <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/adl-trump-rally-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ADL</a> got involved. </p><p>Subsequent complaints from Democratic representative Ritchie Torres caused Twitch to adopt <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-politics-sensitive-social-issues-rules-hasan-piker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new set of policies</a> around labeling political streams so advertisers can avoid them. Amid this backdrop, <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/why-online-organizers-are-pressuring-advertisers-to-reconsider-twitchs-brand-safety-over-antisemitism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a campaign</a> led by a creator named Dan “DanCantStream” Saltman has been reaching out to hundreds of advertisers with evidence of supposed antisemitism on Twitch, beginning with Twitch’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly disastrous failure</a> to reenable email verification in Israel and Palestine for a full year, but now centering on creators like Piker, who regularly criticizes Israel for its <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing genocide of Palestinian people</a>.</p><p>As of last week,Twitch updated its hateful conduct policy to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zachbussey.bsky.social/post/3layy7s23tc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forbid use of the word “Zionist”</a> when used to “attack or demean another individual or group of people on the basis of their background or religious belief,” a decision <a href="https://x.com/ADL/status/1857492707012210893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ADL applauded</a>. Despite – or perhaps because of – all these attempts at placation, big-name streamers are now saying their ad revenue has cratered. Faze Kaysan <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1856517682805239866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently claimed</a> that his channel was demonetized entirely from ads (though not subscriptions and donations) because he applied an “Iran” tag to it. Another streamer, BigEx, <a href="https://x.com/ExSZN/status/1856500811133792617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> experiencing a similar drop off after he applied a “Venezuela” tag to his stream. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TheStockGuy Frustrated Over 80% Drop In Twitch Ad Revenue" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G40DeqzWIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Others recently began claiming that their ad revenue has fallen off a cliff without an apparent cause. TheStockGuy, for example, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1857455323172176135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said during a recent broadcast</a> that he used to make $600-$700 per week from ads, totalling out to around 40 percent of his Twitch income. Now that number has dropped to $15.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know what's going on,” TheStockGuy said. “I have no idea. I don't pay attention to this shit on my platform. I have nothing to do with it."</p><p>But other streamers think they at least understand the broad strokes of the issue, with big names like Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo calling for politics to be <a href="https://x.com/fearedbuck/status/1857577742704980124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“permanently” banned from Twitch</a>, even if that means Piker gets the perma-boot in the process. One wonders what Rinaudo would have said if chatters name-dropped Asmongold, his friend and stablemate at streamer organization OTK who has <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1858228011734089942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a history of heinous political statements</a>, instead of Piker. Asmongold and Piker, in turn, have <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/asmongold-responds-to-hasan-blaming-him-for-twitch-adpocalypse-2980114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone back and forth</a> on who deserves blame for the predicament Twitch now finds itself in. For the most part, though, Piker sees this as the impact of a bad-faith campaign against him and other leftist political streamers, with other, unrelated streamers getting caught in the crossfire.</p><p>“[The campaign] is completely rooted within no real ambition to tackle any bigoted sentiment whatsoever; it is just cynical as fuck,” <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2300182778?t=6h38m32s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piker said</a> during a recent broadcast. “The very same people that have launched these campaigns are <a href="https://kick.com/dancantstream/clips/clip_01JCF86MW305V9185DYG9SK46K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openly</a> talking about how funny it is. They don't even give a shit about it at all. And now you've got random content creators getting screwed over. It's crazy."</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's not a fucking adpocalypse. It is an advertising thing that is happening to a specific subset on the platform.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The “ban politics” opinion is not echoed by all of Twitch’s most-outspoken mainstays.</p><p>"Every platform is doing things that would make advertisers leave," <a href="https://x.com/kaceytron/status/1857809538755223668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kacey "Kaceytron" Caviness said</a> in response to the suggestion that advertisers getting cold feet is proof that Twitch is in the wrong. "Trust me, Twitch has a much better handle on the content on their platform than the plethora of neo-Nazi shit you see on YouTube. There just aren't a bunch of no-life hall monitor incels reporting it."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube is a relevant point of comparison, as some creators have begun referring to what’s happening on Twitch as its own version of YouTube’s 2017 “<a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/YouTube_Adpocalypse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adpocalypse</a>,” a series of advertiser boycotts that forced the company to pour millions into creating one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/23/twitch-subs-ads-layoffs-kai-cenat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most sophisticated</a> ad targeting systems in the world. It remains to be seen whether Twitch will take drastic action; <a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/exclusive-key-advertisers-pause-spending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one report suggests</a> that the actual number of advertisers pausing spending on Twitch has been “limited but not insignificant.” Nonetheless, drama farmers <a href="https://x.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1858326297207800223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Daniel "Keemstar" Keem</a> have taken to catastrophizing about this supposed purple-hued adpocalypse for content.</p><p>But over the weekend, the adpocalypse narrative took some pretty serious hits. TheStockGuy returned after doing some tinkering and figured out the culprit on his end: Turns out, he'd previously <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1858549990039142642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applied an "election" tag</a> to his channel. Once he removed it, his ad revenue went back to normal. This suggests that Twitch is diverting ads from political content – not that advertisers are suddenly abandoning the platform in droves.</p><p>"There's not a fucking adpocalypse," TheStockGuy said. "It is an advertising thing that is happening to a specific subset on the platform. I took it off, and guess what? I'm back."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PirateSoftware says that he has not seen any change in Ad revenue on his channels after supposed Adp" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJTX5hvtkbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Jason "PirateSoftware" Hall, who regularly manages to pull in over 10,000 concurrent viewers and is, by most important metrics, a big streamer, offered a similar read of the situation.</p><p>"There's no adpocalypse going on," Hall said during a recent broadcast. "None of our ad revenue has changed. None of the ad revenue of any streamer that I know has been changed. I know that there were some problems with specifically certain tags that were on Twitch that people were talking about, but none of our shit has had problems."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Twitch with questions about recent ad revenue woes, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Sometimes drama leads to increased viewership. After all, if right-wing creators have taught us anything, it’s that rage on the modern internet means engagement, and engagement means more prominent algorithmic placement. This is the principle that underlies an overwhelming amount of right-wing content. But today’s fights could also have lasting consequences, whether they come from interpersonal feuds or from popular creators who claim some degree of liberal- or leftist-ness while regularly espousing right-wing talking points, like The (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCLB5QUyFrv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Increasingly Transphobic</a>) Young Turks or debate-bro scene king Steven “Destiny” Bonnell, the latter of whom has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@destiny/search?query=hasan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banging the anti-Piker drum so hard</a> recently that it’s on the verge of caving in.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think if Twitch was the same size as YouTube, they wouldn't care about, like, the Steven Crowders of the world, the way that YouTube doesn't care about literally Steven Crowder [himself].</p></blockquote></figure><p>Though Twitch has tried to at least performatively champion progressive causes over the years, it is uniquely vulnerable to outside influence due to its relatively small size and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of profitability</a>. Public conflicts involving both creators and influential external forces like the ADL put additional pressure on Twitch to apply its purposefully-vague rules against streamers dealing with bad-faith attacks and other applications of strength in numbers.</p><p>Denims, who was among the streamers that got suspended from Twitch for a month following claims of antisemitism, sees two options: stay on Twitch and risk getting suspended again – and now, possibly demonetized – or go to YouTube and just face possible demonetization.</p><p>"I think if Twitch was the same size as YouTube, they wouldn't care about, like, the Steven Crowders of the world, the way that YouTube doesn't care about literally Steven Crowder [himself],” Denims told Aftermath. “But because Twitch is, relative to YouTube, much smaller, they actually have to care a lot, which has put them in an awkward position where they want to capitalize on political content because they're a company, but they don't want to hurt their bottom line, and they already aren't making any money because streaming is very expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>“For me, it makes me feel like Twitch is not really my home anymore, because they're in this transition period of growth,” Denims continued.“I think between getting your [YouTube] videos demonetized and getting banned on your streaming platform, I would prefer to get my videos demonetized and try to work around whatever got me demonetized for the next video and the one after that."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Nothing Is True, And Everything Is Possible</strong></h2><p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though. While leftist content creators face an uphill battle no matter which platform they’re on, there is a clear opportunity to build formats that are new, different, and perhaps better – removed from both party-line-towing traditional media and alt media’s endlessly-spurting slop firehose.</p><p>"I don't know what my future is going to look like,” said Kwan. “But I really like the fact that I cover a lot of pop culture, and I am a leftist, and I try to fuse the two and teach people, educate people, entertain people, but above all, create a community that is a positive one – not one where we're disseminating hateful views that are further marginalizing already marginalized people."</p><p>"A lot of what is considered to be quality work coming out of the left is enjoyable because it's what people like Joe Rogan are not: tightly scripted, well researched, and unambiguous in conclusions,” said Sarah Z. “I don't think that is a bad thing, and I also don't think we should be considering deradicalization as a primary goal, because artful treatment of the news and broader culture is important, but it's going to influence and create culture with a very different timescale and potential for spread than the reactionary stuff."</p><p>She went on to draw a parallel to the recent election: Democrats spent much of their time reaching for the center and tailoring their messaging to (largely-imaginary) disaffected Republicans. In the end, hardly anybody on the right or left was excited by what they were saying. Despite demand for an alt-alt media ecosystem, content creators needn’t fall into the same trap, especially when, at the end of the day, it’s on politicians to offer people change worth mobilizing around – and not on content creators to prop up dud policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>There's a really big silver lining to Kamala Harris losing, and that is that the field is open.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"I don't think our goal should be explicitly to attract right-wing audiences,” Sarah Z said. “And of course, that doesn't mean there's no space for people who don't already agree with us. But as far as I can tell, with the recent election, conservative voters tend to vote conservative. … I think this focus on creating a media ecosystem that brings in outsiders is less impactful than making work that energizes and educates those who are already willing to listen. I think to strive for conversion as a primary goal is to intentionally create work that's less than substantive."</p><p>Geller hopes he can at least provide a persuasive alternative to what’s out there, something that sticks in people’s minds long enough to maybe change them.</p><p>"I don't think that the right provides a very interesting way to critically analyze or take apart art, and so I'm kind of hoping that it is almost implicit in my approach,” he said. “What I would love to happen is [somebody is] stumbling across YouTube, they see one of my videos, watch it, and it is considered enough that then they see the contrast with an Asmongold, and they think 'Wow, I guess I've been eating trash, and I just didn't know it until now, because I had never eaten anything that wasn't trash. Here's something that provides some other version of what this could be.'"</p><p>Beyer, who is part of the cadre that streams nearly every day like Piker, sees each time he goes live as an opportunity to build and strengthen his community for whatever lies ahead.</p><p>"I'm really interested in what will happen when we have, as capitalism inevitably does, another economic contraction,” Beyer said. “Will we have another opportunity? I think the reason why Bernie Sanders was not able to win is because economically, in 2016 and 2020, the economy wasn't that bad. ... If the left-wing bubble had happened, corresponding with a decline in confidence in capitalism or the markets themselves, it might have been a different outcome. So I'm building for the opportunities that lay ahead one day. There's a really big silver lining to Kamala Harris losing, and that is that the field is open, and we'll have nobody to blame but ourselves if we choose to do another Biden, Clinton, Obama, [or] Harris Democratic party."&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Scott’s widescreen frames brilliantly capture our universal feelings and anxieties and blows them all up in spectacular fashion. Even when his execution falls short of his reputation – and admittedly, they do so more often than not – a mediocre Scott film demands more attention than a perfectly fine whatever else.</p><p>With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-mf-doom-popcorn-bucket-regal-russell-crowe-1851668769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-mf-doom-popcorn-bucket-regal-russell-crowe-1851668769"><em>Gladiator II</em></a></span> waiting in the wings, it’s a good time to reflect on his extensive body of work. Here are all 28 movies directed by Ridley Scott’s, ranked from worst to best:</p></div></div><div><p>Exhibiting some of Ridley Scott’s worst tendencies, the 1992 historical drama <em>1492: Conquest of Paradise</em> is so poorly executed that it might make you sympathize with flat earthers. While Scott’s camera captures a staged rendition of Christopher Columbus’ expedition to the New World with operatic grandeur, there’s no substance behind its sails. The film is merely a string of shots, each resembling a glorified screensaver, featuring a saltwater-soaked Gérard Depardieu aimlessly wandering in colonial cosplay. This critique isn’t about how monstrous the real Columbus was or the film’s gross mythologizing of historical atrocities—it’s simply a dull, uninspired movie with nothing meaningful to say.</p></div><div><p>Here’s Scott operating at his usual maximum decibels, a big budget escapist piece for grownups that were falling out of favor amid Marvel’s rise to power. Unfortunately, <em>Exodus</em>’ bloated excess, melodramatic incoherence, and overall <em>300</em>-ification of a story other filmmakers of years past have beautifully told already make it among the weakest entries in Scott’s prolific oeuvre.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve worked. It’s Sir Anthony Hopkins returning to one of his most famous roles in a sequel helmed by one of the preeminent studio auteurs of the time. Instead, <em>Hannibal</em> is a sequel far too schizophrenic to know what kind of horror movie it wants to be and too unambitious to compete with its predecessor, Jonathan Demme’s handsome <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p></div><div><p>It’s painful to think about <em>Robin Hood</em> when you remember the movie it almost was. In the original <em>Nottingham</em> script by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, the story took a fresh approach with a more sympathetic Sheriff, an amoral Robin Hood, a steamy love triangle, and even period-accurate forensic science. Silly? Perhaps. But it would have been different—essentially a big-budget <em>Law &amp; Order</em> set in 1199 AD. Instead, what we got was Russell Crowe starring in a beautifully rendered but uninspired retelling of the English legend. <em>Robin Hood</em> is big, bloated—and not bad, but why bother when Errol Flynn’s version is still unbeatable? (Honestly, even Kevin Costner’s will do.)</p></div><div><p><em>Someone to Watch Over Me</em> is a neat dive into the neo-noir thrillers that proliferated the latter half of the ‘80s. Scott’s blocking and framing is once again worthy of study for film students. Beyond its striking visuals, however, it’s underwhelming—a story filled with bland characters and a lackluster romance that never manages to ignite any real passion or intrigue.</p></div><div><p>Reuniting Scott with Russell Crowe (in the second of five movies together), <em>A Good Year</em> stars Crowe as a workaholic London trader who inherits his uncle’s vineyard in France where he falls for an alluring cafe owner (Marion Cotillard). Mostly sauceless with its few dashes of zest coming out of Crowe and Cotillard’s chemistry, <em>A Good Year</em> is like a full plate of bland cuisine – when “fine” feels too far from good.</p></div><div><p>Based on the real-life tragedy of the brigantine <em>Albatross</em>, which sank on May 2, 1961, the film follows a group of young men on a school-sponsored sailing trip led by their captain, “Skipper,” Dr. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges). When the ship is devastated by a sudden windstorm—the titular “white squall”—the boys’ survival hinges on the critical lessons they’ve learned throughout their journey. <em>White Squall</em> doesn’t chart any new or particularly thrilling cinematic waters, but its earnestness and emotional pull make it easy to get swept away.</p></div><div><p>Not long after Tom Cruise rose to stardom dancing in his underwear and socks, Scott worked with the newly certified A-lister for his dark storybook fantasy <em>Legend</em>. Fantasy was a new genre playground for Scott, who, in 1985, had already unleashed two of his most seminal sci-fi movies, <em>Alien</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>. But as magnificent as its vibes are (and a movie I personally recommend to <em>Soulsborne</em> faithful), <em>Legend</em> doesn’t have much going for it besides Tim Curry as a devilishly masculine Darkness—an all-time achievement in makeup and design working in concert with Curry’s flamboyant charisma. <em>Legend</em> is a confused movie, ostensibly a classic fairy tale with arthouse stylings.</p></div><div><p><em>All the Money in the World</em> is often remembered as the film that erased Kevin Spacey in the wake of his career-destroying allegations, but it deserves more recognition than that. Based on John Pearson’s 1995 nonfiction book <em>Painfully Rich</em>, the film recounts the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and his mother’s (Michelle Williams) futile attempts to convince his billionaire grandfather (Christopher Plummer, replacing Spacey) to pay the ransom. This leads to increasingly desperate measures to recover her teenage son. While it functions as a fairly standard ransom thriller, it’s Williams’ powerhouse performance that elevates the movie, making it a compelling watch. It’s nothing short of a crime that her exceptional work was overlooked by the Academy Awards, earning only a Golden Globe nomination.</p></div><div><p>Demi Moore’s dubious (and totally undeserved) Razzie Award win for Worst Actress aside, Ridley Scott’s <em>G.I. Jane</em>—a fictionalized account of the first woman to train in the U.S. Navy SEALs—is an imperfect but commendable film. Moore stars as Lieutenant Jordan O’Neil, who is hand-selected for a trial program to integrate women into the Navy. Her commanding officer, Master Chief John Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen), pushes her to the brink. In contrast to most of Scott’s work, <em>G.I. Jane</em> is an uplifting story about grit and perseverance, underpinned by a potent feminist message. Its noble efforts, however, are somewhat undermined by an uncritical embrace of jingoism.</p></div><div><p>Loaded with all the hallmarks of post-9/11 spy thrillers, Ridley Scott’s <em>Body of Lies</em> delivers entertaining dadcore fare that fans of Tom Clancy games might enjoy. Based on David Ignatius’ 2007 novel, which was inspired by the real-life Operation Mincemeat conducted by British forces during World War II, the film follows the intense efforts of a CIA operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his manipulative boss (Russell Crowe) as they work to flush out a terrorist leader in the Middle East. But how much can they really trust each other? With complex surveillance shots, roving black SUVs, and DiCaprio shouting into tiny cell phones, <em>Body of Lies</em> doesn’t reinvent the spy movie wheel—but it doesn’t have to.</p></div><div><p>Depending on which version you see, <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> can be either holy or unholy. The theatrical cut of <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>, a liberally fictionalized chronicle of the Italian noble Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) who fought in the Crusades, bombed in theaters. Incoherent and oppressive, the film captures the misery of the Crusades, but ultimately falls short. While it contains moments of visual beauty, expected from the director of <em>Gladiator</em>, it feels incomplete. That was because it was. When <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> hit DVD, Ridley Scott personally supervised an extended director’s cut, adding 40 minutes of restored material originally excised due to studio meddling and audience test screenings. The result transformed a flawed film into a modern masterpiece.</p></div><div><p>In his critically acclaimed directing debut, Ridley Scott came out swinging with <em>The Duelists</em>, a historical drama in which Harvey Keitel and Keith Carradine portray rival French officers locked in a 20-year battle of attrition. The film marked Scott’s transition from television commercials to theatrical narrative filmmaking, with the director drawing ample inspiration from Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. Told through a series of painterly tableaus, <em>The Duelists</em> captures the broader political turmoil of Napoleonic France while making each duel intensely personal, thanks to the onscreen tension between Keitel and Carradine. Uncharacteristically for Scott’s later films, <em>The Duelists</em> received particular praise for its historical accuracy, especially the meticulously choreographed sword fights.</p></div><div><p>Ridley Scott’s recent take on the life of French officer-turned-Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte has drawn criticism from historians, but Scott has never claimed to be making documentaries. In this exceptionally long historical biopic, Joaquin Phoenix takes on the iconic role of Napoleon, charting his rise to power in 19th-century France, with the captivating Vanessa Kirby co-starring as his calculating first wife, Joséphine. While the film captures the dour gloom surrounding a figure often regarded as a tyrant, <em>Napoleon</em> is unexpectedly funny at times, thanks to Phoenix’s committed performance and his knack for portraying the outsized power wielded by one small man. The result is a compelling film—but be ready to bid <em>au revoir</em> to your entire afternoon.</p></div><div><p>Imagine <em>Blade Runner</em> without the flying cars—that’s essentially Ridley Scott’s <em>Black Rain</em>, a sleek ‘80s crime thriller that follows a hard-edged cop and his partner (Andy Garcia) from New York to Tokyo. After delivering a yakuza hitman to Japanese authorities only for him to escape under their watch, the duo teams up with a local, by-the-books officer (Ken Takakura) to track down their fugitive—a tattooed needle in a neon-soaked haystack. Much like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Black Rain</em> taps into American anxieties about declining global dominance, with its narrative reflecting the unease about Japan’s economic rise in the late 20th century. At the same time, it weaves an unexpectedly heartfelt story of bridging cultural and personal divides. For fans of Scott’s rain-drenched, atmospheric visuals, <em>Black Rain</em> delivers plenty of eye-catching noir-inspired style.</p></div><div><p>Once again, you’ll want to seek out Scott’s extended director’s cut. A muscular crime thriller filled with hardened bodies and calloused souls, Scott’s 2013 film <em>The Counselor</em> brings Cormac McCarthy’s first spec script to life. It’s a philosophically dense and dialogue-heavy tale about a lawyer (Michael Fassbender) whose decision to involve himself in a drug deal at the Mexico-Texas border spirals out of control. One of Scott’s most divisive films—polarizing audiences between admiration and disdain—<em>The Counselor</em> is undeniably intriguing. It offers a dark, unflinching interrogation of human failings like greed, delivered with a perspective as bleak and unforgiving as crude oil.</p></div><div><p>A star-studded, buttoned-up tale of aristocratic intrigue, <em>House of Gucci</em> chronicles the doomed romance between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), heir to the Gucci fortune and its iconic fashion brand, and his wife Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga). The highly publicized feud within the Gucci dynasty feels tailor-made for Ridley Scott’s sensibilities—a director who often prioritizes drama and detail over strict factual accuracy. <em>House of Gucci</em> mirrors the irony of the fashion industry itself: a world where characters obsess over appearances and reputation but have no qualms about getting their hands dirty.</p></div><div><p>At once part of the <em>Alien</em> franchise but eager to forge its own path, Ridley Scott’s <em>Prometheus</em> marks a return to the director’s haunting and enigmatic sensibilities after years of Hollywood grandeur. Set in the late 21st century, the film follows a team of explorers aboard the starship <em>Prometheus</em> on a mission to uncover the origins of humanity—only to find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. A visually stunning piece of sci-fi horror, <em>Prometheus</em> explores humanity’s hubris, weaving together influences from Greek mythology, Judeo-Christian themes, and the chilling vastness of Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p></div><div><p>In Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Eric Jager’s nonfiction book, a French knight (Matt Damon) during the Hundred Years’ War accuses his former squire (Adam Driver) of sexually assaulting his wife (Jodie Comer) and challenges him to one of the last recorded trial-by-combat duels in France. Essentially a <em>Rashomon</em>-style tale with striking #MeToo parallels, <em>The Last Duel</em> unfolds through three conflicting perspectives—though the film asserts there is only one truth. Sober, somber, and gripping, <em>The Last Duel</em> brims with unflinching brutality. While it may not rank as Scott’s all-time best, it stands out as one of his finest works in years.</p></div><div><p>You can practically smell the dust and debris, feel the heat radiating from a hot assault rifle, and hear your ears ringing from freshly detonated grenades. Released just weeks after 9/11, Ridley Scott’s <em>Black Hawk Down</em> offered audiences a visceral glimpse into the evolving face of warfare through its depiction of the 1993 Black Hawk Down incident during the Somali Civil War. The film follows a U.S. military mission to stabilize the conflict, which spirals out of control when Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leaving outnumbered soldiers to regroup and survive against overwhelming odds. Despite its historical inaccuracies and a sometimes dizzying narrative, <em>Black Hawk Down</em> masterfully blurs the line between thrilling spectacle and nail-biting terror. Unsurprisingly, it became a touchstone for military media that followed, influencing everything from <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em> to Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em>.</p></div><div><p>Five years after <em>Prometheus</em>, Scott returned to helm his own sequel to the franchise he began. 2017's <em>Alien: Covenant</em> officially bridges <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>, following the story of a damaged colonial ship that makes landfall on a mysterious planet hiding a dark secret—and a hostile entity. While the narrative borrows heavily from Scott’s original <em>Alien</em> and offers nods to other entries in the franchise, <em>Covenant</em> serves as a satisfying continuation of <em>Prometheus</em> while delivering some fresh thrills of its own. True to the spirit of the iconic tagline that made <em>Alien</em> unforgettable, <em>Covenant</em> reminds us: “In space, no one can hear you scream.”</p></div><div><p>As smart, funny, and suspenseful as Andy Weir’s book—and featuring a striking auburn-orange color palette to bring Mars to life—<em>The Martian</em> allows Ridley Scott to flex different tonal muscles. The film manages to be as light as zero gravity without downplaying the severity of its premise. Matt Damon delivers a commanding performance, supported by an exceptional ensemble cast (Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, and many more), even though most of the characters feel light years apart from each other for much of the runtime. <em>The Martian</em> is simply good stuff—very good stuff.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Gladiator</em> isn’t Ridley Scott’s greatest movie, it certainly deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as whatever is. A massive hit upon its release in summer 2000, the film resurrected the sword-and-sandals epic with a gripping revenge tale about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a decorated Roman general betrayed by the scheming new emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) and forced to survive as an enslaved gladiator. Brimming with raw machismo and solidifying Crowe’s star power in cinematic bronze, <em>Gladiator</em> was one of the last films to both dominate the box office and claim the Oscar for Best Picture. “Are you not entertained?” We definitely were.</p></div><div><p>The next time <em>Matchstick Men</em> pops up on cable (assuming you still have a subscription), give it a chance—you might be pleasantly surprised despite its seemingly ho-hum premise. Nicolas Cage stars as a neurotic, tic-riddled con man whose carefully constructed life of crime unravels when he meets his teenage daughter (Alison Lohman). <em>Matchstick Men</em> feels distinct from most of Ridley Scott’s filmography, its understated mise en scène lacking the grand scope and sensory overload typical of his work—except for a final twist so devastating it might knock you off your couch. What <em>Matchstick Men</em> does showcase, however, is another of Scott’s greatest strengths: collaborating with top-tier actors and bringing out their very best performances.</p></div><div><p>The beauty of Scott’s <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> lies in more than just its iconic final shot—it’s in the journey that brings its characters to that unforgettable moment. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis shine as the titular protagonists, two friends whose short road trip spirals into a run from the law after they kill an attempted rapist. As they traverse the country, Thelma and Louise embark on a deeper quest for independence, finding meaning and self-actualization in the ever-growing distance between themselves and the oppressive world they’ve left behind. Celebrated as both a landmark feminist film and one of the greatest road movies ever made, <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> endures in memory just as it concludes: bold, defiant, and unforgettable.</p></div><div><p>Scott’s sweeping exploration of the American Dream comes to life in <em>American Gangster</em>, embodied in the story of Frank Lucas, the infamous Harlem gangster who built a heroin empire during the Vietnam War—allegedly smuggling the drug into the U.S. via caskets carrying dead servicemen. Denzel Washington commands the screen as Lucas, delivering a performance of chilling ruthlessness and emotional reserve. Russell Crowe reunites with Scott to play the determined cop relentlessly pursuing Lucas’s criminal enterprise. </p><p>Nearly flawless from start to finish, <em>American Gangster</em> transcends its generic title to become perhaps one of the greatest films about gangsters and dreamers, capital and power, and the opportunities within corruption since <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Goodfellas</em>. How good is it? Good enough to inspire Jay-Z to record one of his finest albums.</p></div><div><p>It’s almost unfathomable that <em>Blade Runner</em> was overlooked at the box office in 1982, only to later become one of the most influential films of all time. A mesmerizing blend of detective noir and speculative science fiction, <em>Blade Runner</em> delves deep into themes of identity, purpose, and memory. The film follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), an ex-cop turned bounty hunter tasked with retiring lifelike androids known as “replicants,” including a particularly dangerous one (Rutger Hauer) leading an outlaw gang. </p><p>Its impact on the sci-fi genre cannot be overstated; nearly every piece of sci-fi media since owes something to <em>Blade Runner</em>. What holds it back from the absolute top tier of Scott’s filmography is the existence of seven different versions of the film, each offering a slightly different vision. For first-time viewers, seek out the 2007 <em>Final Cut</em>—the only version where Scott had complete creative control.</p></div><div><p>A startling and visually stunning sci-fi horror about humanity’s (or more precisely, women’s) survival against the unknown, Scott’s sophomore feature, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-10-year-art-design-original-film-1851452422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-10-year-art-design-original-film-1851452422"><em>Alien</em></a></span>, follows the ill-fated crew of a spaceship as they attempt to expel a malevolent entity after it infiltrates their vessel—delivering one of the most grotesque and iconic reveals in movie history. Sigourney Weaver gradually takes center stage as Ellen Ripley, a warrant officer who joins the ranks of Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode in defining the “final girl” archetype of the horror genre.</p><p>Even without considering the countless sequels, comics, video games, and other media it inspired, <em>Alien</em> stands tall as one of the finest achievements in Scott’s illustrious career. More than that, it’s simply one of the greatest films ever made. Period.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a game featuring a large cast of flawed people trying to come together to stop someone who thinks they are doing the right thing, but which will kill many. But who cares about all that? I’m here to talk about kicking people off cliffs over and over again and how much fun it is.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

After releasing live-service shooter <em>Anthem</em> and open-world checklist simulator<em>s Mass Effect Andromeda</em> and <em>Dragon Age Inquisition</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/mj05e3utmclxx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/mj05e3utmclxx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>feels like a return to form for the famous studio. The new RPG is more linear, more character-focused, and probably the best BioWare game since<em> Mass Effect 3. </em>And one big reason I love the game is that it lets me kick enemies, big and small, off cliffs and into giant pits. </p><p>Very early into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span>, my character was given the special ability to do a powerful drop kick that sends enemies flying. And 40+ hours later, I’m still drop-kicking fools and smiling each and every time. I know the game probably expected me to try out more abilities, and I have, but I always keep the big kick in my hot bar. I can’t imagine playing <em>Veilguard </em>without it.</p><figure id="" data-id="4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-recommend-id="image://4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows the main character drop kicking an enemy off a ledge.

But I’d be lying right now if I said the drop kick wasn’t a big reason why the new RPG is currently sitting on my preliminary game of the year list. </p><p>I’ve talked about this before on <em>Kotaku</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695">with <em>Deathloop</em></a></span>, but I give a big thumbs up to any game that lets me instantly defeat enemies by kicking them off cliffs, buildings, or ledges. <em>Veilguard </em>let me end a boss fight in seconds by kicking the enemy off a platform. Wonderful stuff. </p><p>Truly, more games could learn from <em>Veilguard</em>. If you want people to have more fun, add a big kick button.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>More than a year after Baldur's Gate 3 originally launched in August 2023, the game is still putting up impressive numbers, and has even sold one additional copy to someone who may know Pope Francis.</p><p>Larian publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some new Baldur's Gate 3 stats on social media recently</a>, beginning with how the game's average daily peak concurrent players are up 3% this year compared to last year. That likely has to do with the introduction of mods earlier this year, Douse said. Mods have proven to be extremely popular in Baldur's Gate 3, as players have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">downloaded more than 50 million of them</a>.</p><p>Daily active users, meanwhile, are up more than 20% over last year's numbers, while average daily Steam Deck users have increased 61% year-over-year. It's not clear if Douse is talking about Steam numbers specifically with all of these stats, or if they also include data from the Xbox and PlayStation versions.</p><p>These statistics are all well and good and speak to the ongoing and growing popularity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">one of 2023's best games</a>. But the real standout statistic is that Larian sold precisely one more copy in The Holy See, and specifically the Vatican itself. "Thank you Mr. Pope and enjoy the game," Douse said.</p><p>Earlier in November, Douse revealed that Larian had sold two copies of Baldur's Gate 3 in The Vatican, and that the game <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was on one other wishlist</a>. Perhaps that person has now decided to buy the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/holy-see-vatican-city/#people-and-society" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to the CIA</a>, about 1,000 people lived in Vatican City in 2022. The safest bet is that a regular person bought Baldur's Gate 3, not the Pope himself. But imagine if he did?</p><p>Pope Francis met with popular YouTubers, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pope-now-has-at-least-one-video-game-this-one/1100-6441528/" data-ref-id="1100-6441528">one person gave him a copy of the indie RPG Undertale</a>. Pope Francis is not the first world leader to have been gifted a video game. In 2011, Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110469-Polish-Prime-Minister-Gives-Obama-Witcher-2" rel="nofollow " data-ref-id="false">gave United States president Barack Obama a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>.</p><p>Following the smashing success of Baldur's Gate 3, some might have expected Larian to make Baldur's Gate 4, but the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">making something else next instead.</a> "We're working on it.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Syndicate: 60 FPS Console Update Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft didn't give a reason for why this update was coming now, nearly a decade later, but encouraged players to "discover, or rediscover, this classic on new generation consoles."</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Syndicate is set in London during the Industrial Revolution and was the first entry in the series to let players choose between two different protagonists, twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob excels at close-range combat, while Evie specializes in stealth, letting players pick which character matches their playstyle or may be better suited to a specific type of mission. Syndicate is the ninth entry in the longrunning Ubisoft franchise and was the follow-up to 2014's poorly received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-unity/" data-ref-id="5000-253830">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>--criticized at launch for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-fix-assassin-s-creed-unity-bug/1100-6423555/" data-ref-id="1100-6423555">numerous (and often hilarious) bugs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft recently delayed the next main entry in the series, the feudal Japan-based Assassin's Creed Shadows, in order to further "polish and refine the experience" following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"softer than expected" reception to Ubisoft's previous big open-world game, Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Originally slated to release this November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive February 14, 2025</a>. Much like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Shadows will let players freely swap between two different protagonists, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">the African samurai Yasuke or the ninja-like Naoe</a>.</p>

And the reason for the game's existence can be owed in part to a Korean-speaking intern who came into the picture during a tumultuous legal battle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the documentary, developers at the studio discussed its 2002 lawsuit against Vivendi, which gained the retail publishing rights for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">after acquiring Sierra. Vivendi begun licensing out the multiplayer game to cybercafes, leading to Valve filing a lawsuit after Vivendi did not agree the cybercafe fell out of its original purview.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to COO Scott Lynch, the two companies were already in the throes of "torturous" negotiations, so the lawsuit prompted Vivendi to "go World War III." Attorney Karl Quackenbush added the Seattle court sided with Valve, which led to Vivendi hiring a new law firm that hit the studio with multiple counterclaims, including the cancellation of the companies' initial 2001 agreement and Vivendi acquiring the entire Half-Life IP and preventing Valve from doing Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Lynch's words, Vivendi's aim was clear: "'We're going to put Valve out of business, and then we'll bankrupt the two of you'" he said when describing their alleged strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve CEO Gabe Newell flatly called it an intimidation move, one helped by Vivendi knowing Valve's financial situation. "This was really about an assertion of power. [...] They were just trying to crank up our legal costs as another way of draining [time and money] from the company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Valve/Vivendi lawsuit took a toll on the studio, even as developers were mostly said to be siloed off from it so they could focus on making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even so, there was concerns the game could never come out, even if development did finish: at the time, Vivendi was considerably larger, and Newell remarked that at time, it was common for publishers to "bully" developers in this way.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The tide turned in Valve's favor after Vivendi made a massive mistake">The tide turned in Valve's favor after Vivendi made a massive mistake</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both Newell and Valve were "pretty close" to going bankrupt, but things turned in Valve's favor after it asked for documents covering Vivendi's activity in Asia. The documents were all in Korean, which Newell and others speculated may have been another way to drain its resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that summer, the studio employed an intern named Andrew who natively spoke the language and asked him to pore through the documents. He discovered conversations in Korean which directly implicated Vivendi in destroying documents regarding its deal with Valve "as directed"—a potentially illegal move that Quackenbush admitted to never seeing laid out quite like this in his career as a lawyer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve presented those conversations of the evidence being destroyed to the judge, who subsequently sided with the studio and halted Vivendi from further contesting the suit. In the end, Valve secured ownership of Half-Life and Counter-Strike, and ended Vivendi's cybercafe deal. The ability to distribute its own games led to the creation of Steam, which launched in September 2003 and has become a major (and often </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/valve-vivendi-legal-dispute-revealed">controversial</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) fixture of the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can learn more about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">development, from its physics engine to the real-world faces they used for the game's characters, in NoClip's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.
