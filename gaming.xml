The anticipated collection based on the beloved RPG (my personal 2023 GOTY) launched in April, and some buyers noticed that the characters look nothing — and I mean <em>nothing </em>— like how they were advertised. These cursed recreations of Shadowheart, Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Wyll, and Lae’zel look like unlicensed knockoffs when they are, in fact, officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast. And, it costs $50 for the set!</p><p>Anyone who has played the game, or at least seen its cover art numerous times, knows what these characters should look like. They don’t look like 3D-printed discards predestined for the garbage bin, with little to no effort made to look authentic, unless perhaps you’re squinting from 10 feet away.</p><p>In response to buyers posting pictures of the botched figures on social media and retail sites, and likely from <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-companions-got-official-usd50-d-and-d-minis-and-i-am-casting-vicious-mockery-because-what-in-the-nine-hells-is-this/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a> and other sites posting about it last week, <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">WizKids posted an apology</a> to buyers — and to Wizards of the Coast. In it, it details how to get a refund or a replacement to anyone who bought them online or at a local games store. Keep them, replace them, destroy them, pray to them. It’s up to you.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a beautiful moment that is ripped right out of the <em>Last of Us Part II</em> video game, and the show does it justice. But fans who have played the game will know that this segment had a bit more to it originally. It’s only natural that the TV show, with its shorter run time, would have to cut some scenes down, but the wild thing is that it looks like HBO actually shot the rest of the segment and just didn’t use it in the final edit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This section of the game depicts Ellie’s 16th birthday. Joel knows she has a fixation on space and dinosaurs, so what better way to make her big day one to remember than by taking her to a museum that spotlights both? In the game you find a huge dinosaur exhibit on the bottom floor, and after you’ve explored that one, there’s another section dedicated to space travel waiting for you upstairs. Ellie is ecstatic exploring both floors, with the highlight being when she enters a spacecraft and listens to a recording of a pre-apocalyptic NASA launch so she can imagine what it might’ve been like to get off this ruined rock. It’s an incredibly sweet moment sandwiched between a lot of violence and heartache.</p><p>The show, meanwhile, only has one of these floors. We see Joel and Ellie mess around with a solar system diorama and pretend to be astronauts, but we miss the section where Ellie spouts off cool dinosaur facts and puts a hat on their skeletons. Ultimately, if you have to pick one or the other, the spaceship is the more important moment and the one worth showing the TV audience. But, wildly enough, it looks like Pascal and Ramsey shot scenes on a recreation of the dinosaur floor that never made their way into the episode. In the behind-the-scenes featurette for the episode, we can see footage of the actors and crew on the dinosaur floor, complete with all the overgrowth, grit, and grime you’d expect in a place that has been mostly abandoned for decades.</p><p>Fans are sad to see the set but none of the scenes that took place in it. Maybe we’ll see some deleted scenes in the special features whenever the season two box set is released. Who among us doesn’t want to see Ramsey putting a cowboy hat on Pascal as he grimaces and lightly protests? Don’t deny me this, HBO.</p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>has one more episode this season, but it won’t be the end of the show’s take on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story, as HBO is stretching it out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Board game company WizKids has apologised for its recent line of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> miniatures, acknowledging the melty faced monstrosities "missed the mark" and offering full refunds.
</p>
<p>
WizKids announced the range - officially known as Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Icons Of The Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 - at the end of last year, and US customers began receiving their £50/$49.99, seven-character sets earlier this month. However, rather than the crisply detailed renditions of Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Lae'zel and Withers featured in WizKids' promotional material, customers instead received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1ko1rb6/apparently_bg3_miniatures_from_wizkids_started_to/">pre-painted miniatures that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Borja church fresco</a> - and complaints were swift.
</p>
<p>
And now, with more and more images of the squishy faced disappointments being shared online, WizKids has been forced to concede that, yes, its Baldur's Gate 3 miniatures are in fact rubbish. "As a company, WizKids seeks to create products that enhance and add to the enjoyment of game play," it wrote <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">on its website</a>. "We want our customers to build long-lasting, fond memories around game nights with friends and family using our products."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with the D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 Character Boxed Set," it continued. "If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set... We're aware of the recent reports and complaints and are taking them seriously. Our team is currently investigating these issues and taking action to make this right for those whose purchases were negatively affected and to ensure these issues do not recur in future products and reprints."
</p>
<p>
WizKids notes anyone who purchased the box set from a third-party retailer should contact them directly for a refund, while those wishing for a replacement - one that "meets the standards expected" - can do so <a href="https://win.wizkids.com/replacements/">via its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers," WizKids concluded. "We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner. Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this. We appreciate your patience as we focus on getting back to those affected and helping them with their refunds in a timely manner."
</p>
<p>
It's hardly a fitting celebration of developer Larian's acclaimed 2023 RPG, but with the studio's work on the game now largely at an end following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">April's massive Patch 8</a>, Astarion, Karlach, and friends are now entirely at Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Hasbro's mercy. And if that means licensing them out to be turned into unrecgonsisable bits of plastic, then so be. Hasbro has, of course, already confirmed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">keen to find a studio to make Baldur's Gate 4</a>, but with Larian now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-says-studio-didnt-do-dlc-because-it-was-the-boring-option">working on its own mysterious projects</a>, it's unclear how far off that may be.

The complaint stems from the company’s recent introduction of an AI programmed to sound like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader that can respond to a player’s actions and questions</a>.</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement that it understands its members and members’ estates wish to use AI technology in any way they choose. “However,” SAG-AFTRA’s statement continued, “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>While the AI “revolution” slowly replaces human workers with oftentimes inferior products, and despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">some members’ distaste for the practice</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23962349/sag-aftra-tentative-agreement-generative-artificial-intelligence-vote">SAG-AFTRA has embraced the idea of using AI</a> trained to replicate an actor’s performance. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283240/sag-aftra-has-announced-an-agreement-with-ethovox-which-is-building-a-foundational-ai-model-for-voic">established contracts and partnerships with several AI companies</a> with the idea being members can use this technology with specific contract-guaranteed protections. So the act of using an AI to replace Darth Vader’s voice performers (both the late James Earl Jones and those brought in after his death to match his performance) isn’t what SAG-AFTRA is objecting to. Rather, it’s the fact that this was done without Epic Games sitting down with SAG-AFTRA at the bargaining table to hash out the specifics. </p><p>“<em>Fortnite</em>’s signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with AI technology,” SAG-AFTRA wrote. “Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">AI and its use in video game voice and motion performance</a> is the main stumbling block in the ongoing video game voice actor strike. Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the signatory companies of its interactive media agreement broke down last year, and performers have been on strike since July — a length of time that eclipses both the actors and writers strikes of 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In this video, we also get our closest look yet at Switch 2 game cards. While they look pretty similar in size and shape to original Switch cards, they are almost entirely bright red--making them immediately visually distinct from the slate-gray cards of the previous console.

<p>The carrying case, which <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-123697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes for $40 on Nintendo's store</a>, has a flip-down flap that appears to have snug slots to hold up to six games. It also has a zipper pocket, which is shown storing Joy-Con wrist straps.</p><p>Nintendo has been steadily rolling out additional details about the upcoming console on the Nintendo Today app. Last week, for instance, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-controllers-gl-gr-buttons-are-more-customizable-than-we-thought/1100-6531549/" data-ref-id="1100-6531549">Switch 2's new GL/GR buttons will be mappable on a per-game basis</a>, providing players additional control customization in comparison to the original Switch. In addition, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/" data-ref-id="1100-6531631">a number of helpful accessibility features</a> coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">the new GameChat functionality</a>.</p><p>Switch 2 launches on June 5, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders quickly sold out</a> and have since been widely unavailable in the US. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">Nintendo has said that its higher price point</a> may suppress early adoption, although it is still expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 consoles in the 2026 fiscal year</a>.</p>

It's not the first time that we've seen a pretty stacked lineup of games for the brand, and if you're on PC, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+8+Xbox+Game+Studios+Hits+For+Only+%2410+This+Week&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6531624&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fxbox-games-studio-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-xbox-game-studios-hits-for-only-10-this-week%2F1100-6531624%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab eight Xbox Game Studios PC games for only $10</a></strong> from Humble Bundle right now. You'll want to be quick, though, because <strong>this deal expires on May 24</strong>. Each game here will be provided as a key that can be redeemed on your Steam account.</p><p>The Xbox Games Studio bundle includes several blockbusters with a few titles that might have escaped your notice. You've got Remedy's fascinating blend of scripted TV and time-bending action in Quantum Break alongside the interactive drama As Dusk Falls, as an example. Another highlight here is Sunset Overdrive, a cheeky response to the deluge of cover-based shooters doing the rounds back in the early 2010s and developed by Insomniac Games, a studio that has since gone on to establish itself as the developer behind the best Spider-Man games.</p><p>Strategy game fans can also pick up Age of Empires: Definitive Edition for an impressively upgraded tour of history, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a tightly constructed metroidvania with soul-stirring art, and Broken Age is a puzzle-filled adventure game from Brutal Legend developer Double Fine. You can grab the Battletoads remake as well for a surprisingly solid action-adventure featuring a trio of weird heroes named after terrible skin conditions. Up to three players can battle it out, and the game has a lovely hand-crafted art direction.</p><p>Like other Humble Bundle deals, proceeds will go toward charity. Humble partnered with Gameheads for this bundle. Gameheads is a tech training organization focused on teaching game development skills to people from all walks of life.</p><h2>More Humble Bundle deals</h2><p>A few other bundle deals are also available right now.

Less refined but also more linear than its successor, the second game in the trilogy still tells a gripping story of magic fables and grim politicking across a much less overwhelming map.

Some still swear by it but I’ve found the fiddly menus, archaic controls, and opaque directions a chore to muddle through, even if the storytelling lays necessary groundwork for the sequels and goes to places you only ever hear about in the latest game. At just $1.50, though, there’s really no reason not to scoop it up with the rest.

Still expensive, sure, but that's a big chunk of change to evaporate in just a few weeks. If you bought high, I’m sorry. If not, maybe give it a few more dips before you pounce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJw3Y?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex</a>, also from Prismatic. Down 28%, now sitting at $172 after peaking above $240. Honestly, I think Eeveelution fatigue is real. There are just so many of them floating around that even good cards are struggling to keep their value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3O8W?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Clefairy ex from Journey Together</a> has slid 26% this month, from $212 to $158. I still like this card a lot, but the dip is noticeable. Early adopters probably paid more than they should have, and now the market's correcting like it just remembered what money is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg5oM?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> is rough. It's down a staggering 63% since late March, from $242 to $90.50. That’s not a correction, that’s a full-on crash landing. I wouldn’t be shocked if it dips further. Might be worth watching, but I wouldn’t touch it yet unless you’re in it for the art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, we’ve got <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgM8w?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex from Prismatic</a>, down 19% just this month. It was sitting around $84 and is now at $67.75. That’s not terrible, but it’s still part of a clear trend.

It was sitting at a modest $33.92 in mid-March, and now you’re lucky to find one under $240. That’s a 150% leap for a card that’s over a decade old. I’ve seen faster elevators, but not many. With all 156 Unova Pokémon getting fresh prints soon, I think Reshiram’s still got room to climb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwLO3?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom EX from Next Destinies</a>, which has gone from $34.63 to nearly $392 since March. It’s another reminder that Full Art cards from the EX era aren’t just collectible, they’re volatile. In a good way, if you got in early. I’d still grab this if it fits your binder, because it's only going to get more attention once White Flare drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also watching <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKvjX?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sprigatito from Paldea Evolved</a>. The IR version has quietly crept up from $17.98 in January to $21.95 today. It’s not a moonshot, but compared to the general slump of modern IRs, it’s doing surprisingly well. Plus, it’s a smug little cat and people love smug cats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbdJe?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dialga-GX from Forbidden Light</a>. This one was hanging out around $14 just two months ago, and it’s shot up to $74.99. I wouldn’t call it graceful, but it’s definitely gaining traction. GX-era cards are getting more attention lately, and Dialga's age plus playable nostalgia make it a solid hold in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t laugh, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJgO1?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vileplume-GX from Cosmic Eclipse</a> is up too. It was stuck at $6.83 for what felt like forever, and now it’s over $10. It’s not exactly a gold rush, but it’s one of those oddball rares that sneaks up when no one’s looking.

                <p>It wasn't that long ago that Xbox Series X|S owners could only use official Microsoft controllers for wireless play. Outside of modded options from brands like Scuf, the Xbox Wireless Controller and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2 Controllers</a> were the only choices. And while Microsoft's official controllers are quite good, it's always nice to have different models to choose from. So it was a great development when Microsoft opened its wireless protocol to licensed manufacturers. Over the past two years, the market for wireless third-party Xbox controllers has actually become a bit crowded. The latest notable Elite Series 2 challenger to enter the pro-style controller ring is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited</a>.</p><div title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3531" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox &amp; PC Wireless Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><p>The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited has a bevy of premium features, including numerous physical modifications and input customization options.

Though the latest member of the Revolution lineup has some familiar features--the interchangeable weights, for instance--the Revolution X Unlimited does have components not found on Revolution 5 Pro. Most notably, the Xbox edition adds a built-in LCD display and has two swappable D-pads--the Revolution 5 Pro has a custom fighting game-centric D-pad.</p><p>The built-in customization screen is a handy feature that we've seen in a few other controllers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach's Stealth Ultra</a>. It works well, allowing you to remap inputs and create custom profiles. If you plug a wired headset into the 3.5mm audio jack, you can tinker with the EQ settings and game/chat balance directly on the controller. I found the onboard controls helpful since the Revolution X Unlimited software app for Xbox and PC is a bit buggy at the moment, especially on Xbox, where the app crashed while trying to adjust settings. On the flip side, I didn't run into any problems while using the built-in screen.</p><p>In terms of feel, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited accomplishes the task of <em>feeling </em>like a high-end controller. The Hall Effect sticks have a smooth, precise range of motion, and the microswitch face buttons are quick and deliver satisfying feedback. The weighting system is one of the coolest features, especially since part of the reason why Microsoft's Elite Series 2 feels so good is because of its weight distribution. The Revolution X Unlimited's textured grips on the back of the handles can be popped off to switch between the three different weight sets, allowing users to find their preferred "heftiness."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318"></a><figcaption>Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Controller for Xbox/PC/Android</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png"></figure><p>The only aspect of the Revolution X Unlimited that I've found very difficult to get accustomed to is the unique shape and placement of the remappable back buttons. The lower pair of back buttons are shaped like right triangles and positioned near the bottom of the handles. The upper pair of buttons are quadrilateral with irregular sides.</p><p>The shapes are peculiar, but the low placement is what makes them feel quite different compared to many pro-style controllers with back buttons. Typically, my middle and ring fingers naturally rest on the back buttons of similar controllers, including the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro for Xbox/PC</a></strong>. With the Revolution X Unlimited, my normal hand placement set my ring and pinky fingers on the back buttons, which felt awkward. As such, I had to shift my grip downward slightly. If you're used to other pro-style controllers with four back buttons, the Revolution X Unlimited likely won't be easy to use at first. Even after testing it for a few weeks, I still find the layout to be disorienting.</p><p>Outside of the back button placement--which could <i>maybe </i>be more comfortable for players with larger hands--the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited's feature set and components are solid. Along with the adjustable weights, it comes with six rubberized stick caps, two pairs of resistance rings for the sticks, two metal D-pads, a charging stand, and a nice hardshell carrying case to hold everything. It also benefits from adjustable trigger locks, two extra shoulder buttons, and immersive rumble thanks to motors located in both the handles and triggers.</p><p>If the back buttons were more conventional, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited might have eclipsed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/" data-ref-id="1100-6526158">Wolverine V3 Pro as my favorite Elite Series 2 alternative</a>. If you think the back buttons on the Elite Series 2 and other controllers are too close together or located too high, the Revolution X Unlimited might work out well for you. That said, if you're anything like me, you may wind up viewing it as a controller with only two back buttons--I have abandoned the bottom two buttons and only sparingly use the other two. Considering back buttons are arguably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about pro-style controllers, this potential concession is a big one.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited is available now for $200</a>, the same MSRP as the Wolverine V3 Pro and the Elite Series 2 following Microsoft's recent price increase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Some characters torment you simply with their presence. Often this is because they are irritating or embarrassing. Darumi Amemiya from <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a masterclass in being annoying: a creature so debased and overflowing with cringe that I want to shoot her out of a cannon, yet so endearingly true that I will defend her with every fiber of my being. I loathe and love my cringe daughter.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a collaboration between <em>Danganronpa</em> creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape</em> creator Kotaro Uchikoshi. Both series are visual novel adventure games, and both games feature a labyrinthine, twisting narrative with a bunch of idiosyncratic anime characters trapped in a deadly space by a mysterious creature or person.</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the game. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Kotaro Uchikoshi’s storytelling tends towards the existential. He peppers his narratives with heavy handed philosophical, sci-fi and game theory ideas while making aggressive use of branching ergodic narrative structure. Kazutaka Kodaka is far more lurid, gleefully leaning heavily into the debased, violent nature of <em>Danganronpa’s</em> “killing game” premise. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, somehow, represents the perfect synthesis of these tones, a “Dueling Banjos” of two of the most distinct narrative voices in Japanese game development that understands and anticipates the player’s expectations from these two authors.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Though still very much a visual novel, <em>The Hundred Line </em>is also a tactical game in the vein of <em>Fire Emblem</em>. Humanity has been living in some kind of protected bunker when it’s invaded by malicious creatures. After a brief fight the main character, Takumi Sukimo, wakes up in The Last Defense Academy at the behest of a strange, mascot-like entity named Sirei, who looks as if a ghost had legs, a hat, a little bow tie and a visible brain. They are told that their blood is special, compatible with a substance called “Hemoanima” that allows them to self-harm henshin <em>Persona</em>-style by plunging a special knife into their chest and unlocking heretofore unknown powers. They also are told they are functionally immortal on school grounds, allowed to be revived should they fall in battle. I’m still working through the game, and it’s reported that there are 100 distinct endings, although I don’t know if anybody has gotten all of them.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop talking about her favorite niche porno games. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the students in <em>The Hundred Line</em> is a nasty little freak in a distinct and unique way that interacts with how they behave on the battlefield. For example there’s Takemaru, the aggressive, Bōsōzoku-style biker, who becomes a cavalry unit on the battlefield that benefits from distance traveled. Tsubasa the pretty mechanic has a stress reaction that makes her vomit; Shouma is a tiny meek child who looks like a turtle; the Tsukomos can only be described as “the incest twins.” And while each cast member has their foibles, none compare to the queen: Darumi Amemiya.</p><figure><figcaption>Here she Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>When you meet Darumi, she is so aggressively off-putting you are not quite sure what to make of her. Her hair looks like if Hatsune Miku let her roots grow out for several months because she was depressed, and she’s wearing edgelord Heath Ledger Joker makeup. Her outfit looks like a car crash of ‘00s American emo culture and trashy Japanese street fashion: a striped fuku covered in punk patches and gargantuan safety pins. She is annoyingly morbid, a self-loathing Yandere goth who canonically has <a href="https://x.com/Jabberwocky2469/status/1912858379867079009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bipolar disorder</a> according to co-director Akihiro Togawa.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop doing the puppygirl bit. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Darumi constantly rants about doing harm to herself and others, and is obsessed with gory media and eroge. Darumi will frequently name drop her favorite erotic games, forcing your character to play them should you interact with her, often in ways that foreshadow narrative events in the game. It gives me no pleasure to admit that she has frankly fantastic taste in the genre.</p><p>Her obsession with “killing games” is by far the funniest aspect of her character. She is clearly a stand-in for the audience and is probably the most well-adjusted <em>Danganronpa </em>fan in history. On some level you can hear Kodaka lovingly shoving her in your face and saying “See this? This is what you guys all sound like.” If you fall into that category, it’s quite clear that he got your ass.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi is prone to sudden mood swings. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Even outside of the meta context of the game, it is impossible for the intended audience of the work to not experience regular bouts of mortification from everything that she says. In Japanese she is voiced by Fairouz Ai (better known as the voice of Jolyene in <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>) while Sarah Pritard voices her English. Both do a fantastic job at rendering her character in ways distinct to their context, although Pritard’s performance is particularly brutal for anybody who came of age during the aughts. Because her character is almost eternal at this point, it is hard not for me to project my own millennial context on her.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Cut that out Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>In Darumi, I see both myself and the many cringe women and gay men I knew in middle and high school. She is an emo scenester, insecure, the kind of girl who would get way too into <em>Johnny The Homicidal Maniac</em> and have full zip up <em>Invader Zim</em> GIR pajamas. She is a walking Hot Topic despite thinking herself above that, someone who I could see owning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi_paddle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoi paddle</a>. I knew, and on some level was, a person like this: full of self-loathing and overly effusive, swinging between the far ends of depression and uncontrollable excitement, burying myself in extreme and transgressive fiction and externalizing pain as a means of hiding it. And though the cast of <em>The Hundred Line </em>is initially abrasive, the game does its best to sell even the most depraved and cartoonish student, attempting and often succeeding at giving them depth and pathos.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Llama Productions, an Epic Games subsidiary, over how it went about Fortnite's AI-voiced Darth Vader. The charge isn't being laid simply because Llama Productions and Epic used AI. Prior to his passing, James Earl Jones, the original voice for Darth Vader and a litany of other iconic roles, signed a deal with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23372640/star-wars-james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-retired-ai">Respeecher</a> to allow his archived voice-over work to be used in cases like this.</p>
<p>The charge from SAG-AFTRA comes from how Llama Productions went about using an AI version of Jones' voice. SAG-AFTRA is placing the charge because Llama Productions went the AI route "<em>without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms</em>," the organization says in a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games,</em>" SAG-AFTRA writes in its statement.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf"> actual filing</a>, the basis of the charge reads "<em>Within the past six months, the Employer [Llama Productions], by its agents and representatives, failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite</em>."</p>
<p>So it's not that generative AI was used to voice Darth Vader in Fortnite that SAG-AFTRA has a problem with, it's the fact that Llama Productions, by SAG's claims, completely went around SAG-AFTRA when working with Respeecher to bring the AI-version of James Earl Jones' voice to Fortnite.</p>
<p>As far as Jones' family is concerned, when AI Darth Vader was first showcased, his family released the following statement through Epic, saying "<em>James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character</em>."</p>
<p>Hours into AI Darth Vader being in Fortnite, players had been able to make him <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-epic-games-star-wars-james-earl-jones-2000603304">swear</a> and say <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/star-wars-ai-darth-vader-racial-slurs-774932-20250519">offensive slurs</a>.</p>
<p>The strike that SAG-AFTRA actors under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) called <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">last year</a> is still ongoing, and while it wouldn't have impacted games coming out in 2025 and even games in 2026, it will begin to impact future titles if a deal cannot be reached soon. SAG-AFTRA recently published a<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftras-interactive-media-agreement-negotiating-committee-responds-video-game-employers"> rebuttal</a> to the offer put forth by game studios, which, if SAG-AFTRA had signed, would have provided no generative AI protections for any performance that came before this new deal.</p>
<p>Something that the union was clearly not going to agree to. If this is where negotiations are sitting, then it could be a long while before a deal is reached.</p>

			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a week ago, Sony has <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the action game Stellar Blade will debut on PC on June 11. However, it immediately became clear that even though the game did not require users to register for a PlayStation Network account, Stellar Blade was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unavailable for purchase in approximately 130 countries</a>.</p>
<p>South Korean developer Shift Up has commented on that issue and others, such as the criticized addition of the Denuvo DRM software, in a post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>. Regarding the region lock, they are working with Sony to remedy the situation; when it comes to Denuvo, they posted a table showing that the DRM software doesn't actually decrease frame rates when playing the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.</em></li>
<li><em>As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases. Mods are fully supported without any restrictions.</em></li>
<li><em>PSN connecting is entirely optional and NEVER required.</em></li>
<li><em>Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates.</em></li>

<p>Needless to say, many PC users are still doubtful&nbsp;<span>about the inclusion of Denuvo in Stellar Blade. In the past, the DRM software was involved in claims that it negatively affected performance, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-7-denuvo-drm-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Tekken 7</a>&nbsp;and, more recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-pc-stutters-go-away-with-the-crack-digital-foundry-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Resident Evil Village</a>. Other times, it turned out that </span>the anti-tamper software <a href="https://wccftech.com/denuvo-drm-doesnt-impact-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not responsible</a> for any performance decrease.</p>
<p>With only three weeks left before the launch, we won't have to wait long before learning how well Stellar Blade is optimized. The developer has made bold claims, though:</p>
<p><em>After extensive testing and relentless optimization, the game delivers high frame rates on a variety of setups. Even on the Steam Deck, you can reach 45–50 FPS with the right settings.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the game has climbed the best-selling chart on Steam with its pre-orders, making Shift Up very happy. Check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Stellar Blade PS5 review</a> to learn what we thought of the game when it first launched on Sony's console.</p>

In response to the adjusted, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still damaging</a>, US trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the tabletop studio is bumping up the price on several board games in its catalog.</p>



<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios states the effects the trade tariffs have had on board game production. It states the tariffs went into effect well after the company had already manufactured and produced certain board game reprints. The statement also notes that, while the studio will try to absorb some of these costs, some of those costs will be passed on to consumers. Hence, price increases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/renegade-game-studios-naishi-cover-art.jpg?itok=kju4DT2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/renegade-game-studios-naishi-cover-art.jpg?itok=L4T-A255 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The newsletter ends by declaring that three Renegade Game Studios board games will have new marked-up MSRPs. The games, <em>Naishi</em>, <em>Arboretum</em>, and <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, will be sold at an MSRP of $25.</p>

<p>At first, these price increases seem innocuous. All three of these games' original MSRP's were roughly $20. But, bear in mind that most smaller board games are purchased in bulk from retailers, generally in packs of 12 or so. That means a 12-pack of a game just went from $240 to $300 for that retailer. That adds up when it comes to inventory management.</p>

<p><em>Naishi</em> is a board game set in feudal Japan where you attempt to control all of the Japanese Imperial Court through strategic hand management. It was designed by Mathieu Bieri and Alex Fortineau.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Arboretum</em>, designed by Dan Cassar, is a card game about planting a strategic path through a beautiful garden you plant and cultivate.</p>

<p>Lastly, <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, based on the graphic novel series, is designed by Steve Ellis and Tyler Tinsley. It is a light card game about nurturing a tea dragon throughout seasons. It is designed to be accessible and kid-friendly.</p>

<p>It is unclear at this time if these price increases will continue for Renegade Game Studios' catalog. While it is debatable whether or not <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RPG books</a> will be affected like World of Darkness or the recently released <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em></a>, there is the manner of other Renegade-produced franchises like the recently revived <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Axis &amp; Allies</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Heroscape</em></a>.</p>

Trained on the voice of James Earl Jones, who is the voice of Vader in the Star Wars movies and elsewhere, it didn’t take long for players to get this NPC Vader to say curse words and slurs, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-added-an-ai-powered-darth-vader-and-surprise-players-immediately-tricked-him-into-saying-slurs/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>. Now, three days later, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against Epic-owned signatory company, Llama Productions.</p><p>However, it’s not because Fortnite is using AI to give Vader a voice per se. <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">According to the complaint filed today</a>, SAG-AFTRA claims Epic replaced bargained union voice work with this AI without notice, thereby breaking terms and conditions supposedly agreed on by both SAG-AFTRA and Epic.</p><p>“Within the past six months, the Employer, by its agents and representatives, failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite,” the complaint against Llama Productions reads.</p>

<p>In a statement released following this filing, SAG-AFTRA says, “We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of these legacies and renowned roles. However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>The company says Llama Productions chose to replace human performers' work with AI technology but did so “without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” As such, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the company with the NLRB.</p><p>Jones’ family is aware that an AI voice trained on him was added to Fortnite, as they released a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">statement</a> confirming they collaborated with Epic to make this happen. They write, “James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the excitement of this iconic character.”</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>contacted Epic Games for comment and will update this story if it hears back. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The line was the first original transmedia franchise created by Lego, featuring a deep amount of lore and stories told in comics, books, and animated movies. It was planned to run for 20 years but, due to low sales, was ended in 2010. It was revived in 2015, but old fans didn’t embrace the reboot and the revival ended in 2016. Despite a decade having passed since Lego made new <em>Bionicle</em> sets, fans still love the weird franchise featuring bio-organic super robots and sci-fi magic. And for the past eight years, a growing group of fans known as Team Kanohi have been developing their dream <em>Bionicle</em> game, <em>Masks of Power, </em>but have been forced to stop after Lego demanded it.</p><p>On May 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxLNEG4a40njC2XQ9-vAwEbJgV2SBrE68rNx8GimGYY/edit?tab=t.0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxLNEG4a40njC2XQ9-vAwEbJgV2SBrE68rNx8GimGYY/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Kanohi announced</a></span> that the Lego Group requested that the team shut down the project completely and remove <em>Masks of Power</em> from the internet. </p><p>“We’ve been transparent about the hardships our team has faced over the past year as we’ve worked to release the first look at <em>Bionicle: Masks of Power</em>: the ‘FREE THE BAND’ demo,” said Team Kanohi. “After many years of hard work, our team was in the final stages of bugfixing and polishing for the demo’s release. We had planned to shadowdrop the demo on August 10th, 2025.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, it seems that will no longer happen. The LEGO Group has asked our team to shut down our project in its entirety, and remove Bionicle: <em>Masks of Power</em> from the public eye.”</p><p>Despite not being able to release the demo or finish the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/qfaKKmkhB6Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/qfaKKmkhB6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Kanohi has put out a two-hour video</a></span> showing off the unfinished demo for the <em>Bionicle</em> game. The group says it’s still “incredibly proud” of what it has made and I have to agree. This looks awesome, and I’m not even a<em> Bionicle</em> fan. <br></p><p>So why did the Lego Group shut down this project? According to the dev team, they have been in contact with the company for years and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24340&amp;u1=grd-us-3546446059231154313&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Flegal%2Fnotices-and-policies%2Ffair-play%3Flocale%3Den-gb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24340&amp;u1=grd-us-3546446059231154313&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Flegal%2Fnotices-and-policies%2Ffair-play%3Flocale%3Den-gb" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">have followed all of the rules surrounding fan-created content</a></span>. <em>Masks of Power </em>was going to be released for free, and included disclaimers that made it clear this was a fan project. Lego has also officially called out and supported other <em>Bionicle</em> fan games in the past.  However, it seems like <em>Masks of Power</em> was starting to look too official for Lego lawyers. </p><p>“Unfortunately, it seems like the LEGO Group’s stance on fan-created media has changed. While we can only speculate as to the exact reason why they have asked us to remove the game at this time, what we suspect is that our project was too easy to mistake for an official product,” said the devs. “At the time of writing, searching ‘Bionicle game’ on Google lists the Steam page for <em>Bionicle: Masks of Power </em>within the first couple of links.” </p><p>“An average person seeing our game for the first time could easily think that it was an official game at first glance. And no amount of disclaimers we could put up would be able to change that.”</p><p>It’s not all sad news, though, as the team behind the now-cancelled fan game has announced plans to develop a new game—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1704850/Project_Rustbound/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1704850/Project_Rustbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Project Rustbound</em></a></span>—built off the work they put into <em>Masks of Powe</em>r. Hopefully this project gets to see the light of day.<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-lead-designer-says-it-will-take-far-beyond-just-a-few-years-to-realize-games-full-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Honkai: Star Rail, launched in 2023, was an instant hit for publisher HoYoVerse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230602020452/https://youxiputao.com/article/24920.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching 20 million downloads in just a few days</a> and pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in the following years. Globally, many who hopped on board the Astral Express did so in the wake of enjoying another HoYoVerse-published game: Genshin Impact. But Honkai's origins, and the roots of its global success, go much further back than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Honkai series has actually existed since 2011, when the tiny team at miHoYo released FlyMe2TheMoon on iOS. The studio has since exploded in notoriety and team members, including Honkai: Star Rail lead game designer Chengnan An. An joined the Honkai team for Honkai Impact 3rd, which launched in 2016 and directly preceded Star Rail. Having now been with the company across multiple generations of Honkai games and a decade of development, An has plenty to share about the philosophy of the series and why it took off the way it did with the release of Star Rail in 2023, after so many years remaining relatively unknown in the West. We spoke to An in the wake of the Game Developers' Conference (GDC) 2025 to get his perspective on Honkai as a whole, Honkai: Star Rail, and where the Astral Express is headed in the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you tell me a bit about your role in Honkai's origins? When did you join the team working on Honkai, and how have you seen Honkai evolve as a series since you came on board? What's the difference between Honkai in the early days (FlyMe2TheMoon, etc) and Honkai now (Star Rail)?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chengnan An</strong>: I first joined the Honkai Impact 3rd team as the Lead Combat Designer, focusing on refining the game's action mechanics. It was an exciting time — we were constantly pushing the boundaries of what a fast-paced action game could feel like. Seeing players enjoy the combat we designed was incredibly rewarding, and it shaped how I think about game design even now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 2019, I transitioned into a more strategic role as the Lead Game Designer of Honkai: Star Rail, which gave me a broader perspective on game development beyond just combat mechanics. At the time, we started thinking: Could we build on our existing expertise and explore new gameplay directions? Many of us on the team, myself included, are big fans of turn-based games, and by then, we had also gained a lot of experience designing action gameplay. That led to an interesting challenge—could we merge our knowledge/experience from action games with the depth and strategy of turn-based combat to create something fresh? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s how Honkai: Star Rail came to be. It was a natural evolution, not just for the series but also for us as developers. The core Honkai DNA — strong storytelling, deep character interactions, and engaging combat — remains the same.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me about the initial conception and creation of Honkai: Star Rail. What led the team to make a third Honkai game? Were you taking lessons or cues from Genshin Impact, or other Hoyo games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: I can only speak on behalf of the Honkai: Star Rail team. At HoYoverse, in general, each title is developed by an individual team. But of course, we have accumulated valuable experience in terms of technical pipeline, project development, content output, localization, and so on through the development of previous titles, which always have, and always will be essential during the development and further amelioration of Honkai: Star Rail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides, I'd like to elaborate on why Honkai: Star Rail is a space fantasy. This is our first attempt by HoYoverse to explore the science-fiction concept of an "interstellar journey," which provides players with a grand adventure as they traverse the galaxy, explore numerous distinctive planets, and resolve conflicts with the support of unique companions. On top of the science-fiction concept, we incorporated fantasy and mythological elements [Aeon] and [Stellaron] to create an extensive and fatalistic narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What’s the biggest change between the original conception of Honkai Star Rail and its final version? Are there features or ideas you wished you could have used that were left on the cutting room floor?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: The combat system evolved a lot throughout development — there were many mechanics we experimented with, refined, or even scrapped entirely before landing on the final version. One example — something we talked about at GDC — is the evolution of "Weakness Break QTE." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first, we had this idea where breaking an enemy’s weakness would let players manually choose an action, like an attack, heal, or support move. On paper, it made sense, but in practice, it actually slowed down the flow of combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we refined it. Instead of requiring manual input every time, we introduced automatic triggers. This led to what we now call "Follow-Up Attacks" — skills that activate under different conditions. For example, Herta automatically attacks when an enemy’s HP drops below 50%, rather than waiting for a weakness break. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even better, follow-ups can chain together. Imagine this: Herta attacks, dropping an enemy’s HP below half, which triggers her own follow-up. That, in turn, breaks another weakness, activating her teammate Himeko’s follow-up. Just like that, one click sets off a powerful sequence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This shift made combat more dynamic, intuitive, and rewarding, keeping battles engaging while allowing for deeper strategy. And that’s just one of the many ways the system changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Honkai: Star Rail is the third Honkai game, but it blew up internationally in a way that others didn’t. Why do you think that is? What is special about Honkai: Star Rail?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: Honestly, seeing how much love the game has received has been both rewarding and a little unexpected. We set out to create something easy to get into while offering depth, and it’s been amazing to see both veteran fans and newcomers welcome it. The space-fantasy setting paired with turn-based combat provides a fresh experience, yet still stays true to what makes the series enjoyable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also something special about how players connect with the characters and the story. We’ve worked hard to balance humor, emotion, and adventure, and it’s humbling to see it all come together. Of course, the high production values, multi-platform support, and a passionate team have all played a part, but at the end of the day, it’s the players' feedback that truly gives everything its meaning.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Honkai: Star Rail screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How far out do you plan/write the story? How do you handle the challenges that come from telling a good story while constantly needing to expand the world and characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> To provide players with the better experience, we have a well-structured pipeline in place for both story and gameplay development. We plan our storylines at least a year in advance, thinking ahead to new planets and the stories we want to tell. Honkai: Star Rail has been a passion project for the past five years — an ambitious effort driven by our goal to redefine RPGs for a broader audience. Right now, we’re diving deeply into Amphoreus, a world we’ve dedicated a lot of attention to. From Version 3.0 to 3.7, this will be a story arc spanning across 8 versions. We hope players will enjoy this Flame-chase journey as it unfolds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the Trailblaze Mission (the main story), our Adventure Mission serve as more than just side stories — they offer a different lens into each world, its people, and their experiences. Amphoreus, for example, was once a collection of city-states, but as the Black Tide encroached, these cultures were forced to merge in the last refuge, Okhema. Through Adventure Missions like Where Shall We Go? we explore not just the history of Amphoreus but also the hopes, losses, and resilience of its people. The stories deepen the world-building and, more importantly, give players an emotional connection to the characters and civilizations they encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long is it sustainable to keep building such a huge world, story, and so many characters? Do you worry the game eventually becomes unwieldy or inaccessible to new people?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> Developing a new world, such as Penacony or Amphorious, along with so many characters of that world, typically takes more than a year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Core Concept speech at GDC 2025, The Three Design Principles were highlighted for Honkai: Star Rail, and two of them are Simple and Expandable. On the one hand, we emphasize simplicity. For example, in our battle mechanics, the turn-based gameplay allows players to take their time in making decisions. We have streamlined the selection of skills available to players, and additionally, there is an option to enable Auto Combat. This feature ensures that players are not overwhelmed when starting the game or adapting to a new battle strategy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, as a live-service title, we continuously expand the Honkai: Star Rail universe through regular updates. This approach enables us to introduce new content, including new worlds (as previously mentioned), characters, and gameplay elements. However, the expansion of content does not mean we aim to make Honkai: Star Rail overwhelmingly vast or inaccessible; we remain committed to our principle of simplicity. We have implemented various mechanisms aimed at simplification. For instance, leveling up characters has become more accessible and stragihtword through our guiding system. Moreover, we even offer quicker access to new content: in version 3.0, players can head straight to Amphoreus and experience the latest Trailblaze Mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you looking at the Switch 2 at all for Honkai: Star Rail? What about Xbox?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> We have consistently aimed to attract more players to our space fantasy RPG. That’s why we made this title available on both PC and mobile devices from day one of its official release. In version 1.4, we also added support for PS5. Additionally, as a live-service title, we are committed to providing ongoing opportunities for our players as time goes on. For the latest updates, please stay tuned to our official websites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you see a growing trend of Chinese-developed games succeeding on the international stage? Is that impacting how you approach game development at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: This was my first time attending GDC, and I was thrilled to see developers from around the world connecting, sharing their insights, and collaborating to enhance the gaming industry. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to meet some fans who were incredibly passionate about our title, which was truly an honor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preparation for the GDC 2025 Core Concept, I dedicated significant time to carefully reviewing previous development logs and player's feedback. It was an enlightening experience that not only reminded me of the old days that we've spent on this space fantasy, but also underscored the importance of continuously listening to our players. Ultimately, a live-service title is not solely about providing content through updates; it also entails a long-term commitment to improving and fulfilling our players’ expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long do you expect to sustain Honkai: Star Rail? Will you eventually make a fourth Honkai game? What does this franchise look like in ten years?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> Honkai: Star Rail presents an incredibly vast and intricate galaxy to explore. To be honest, to fully realize its potential is a long-term endeavor that extends far beyond just a few years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What am I not asking you that you want me to ask you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> How about asking how I feel about the title as of right now? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are on the brink of celebrating the 2nd anniversary of Honkai: Star Rail alongside the upcoming release of the Version 3.2. Although the game officially launched on April 26, 2023, its development actually began back in 2019. From the perspective of some of our development team members, myself included, this means we have been passionately invested in this space fantasy RPG for approximately more than 5 years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to emphasize that we have always listened to and communicated with our players and will continue to do so. We have many exciting developments in the works — including new content and gameplay optimizations — ready to be revealed to our players. A preview of some of these was shared during the 3.2 Special Program on March 28, and development and fine-tuning for future versions are progressing steadily. Stay tuned for more updates and thank you for your continued support!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
