And season 2.5 might be the game’s biggest shake-up yet. I’ve got good news for Punisher mains and bad news for Captain America lovers.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 22, NetEase posted a new video</a></span> featuring the developers of <em>Rivals </em>talking about the upcoming season 2.5 patch. The new update is set to arrive on May 30 across all platforms. First, the news you’ll likely care about most if you regularly play <em>Rivals</em>: Who is getting nerfed and buffed?</p><h2 id="h1941"><a id=""></a>All the buffs and nerfs in <em>Rivals </em>season 2.5</h2><p>Both <strong>Groot</strong> and <strong>Captain Americ</strong>a’s survivability will be getting toned down a bit in season 2.5. Meanwhile, <strong>Emma Frost</strong>’s “Diamond Form” will be getting nerfed, too. All members of the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and <strong>Namor </strong>are getting a nerf to their team-up abilities. Separately,<strong> Human Torch</strong> is getting a nerf alongside <strong>Iron Fist </strong>and<strong> Psylocke</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643"><strong>Punisher</strong> (yes!)</a></span>, <strong>Squirrel Girl</strong>, and <strong>Storm </strong>are getting “modest” buffs. Hopefully, that means Punisher’s rifle will actually kill people and not harmlessly bounce off most heroes like a peashooter. <strong>Doctor Strange </strong>and <strong>Magneto </strong>are also getting similar “modest” buffs. </p><p>A bunch of team-up changes are happening in 2.5, including the removal of some popular ones. Goodbye to Iron Man and Hulk’s gamma team-up. Other team-ups being retired: Luna Snow and Jeff, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Punisher and Rocket, and also Venom and Peni. But a ton of new team-ups are coming, including ones for Iron Man and Ultron, Black Widow and Punisher, and Luna Snow and Hawkeye. The wildest new team-up is between Storm and Jeff. You’ll be able to create sharknados when combining their ultimate abilities.</p><p>2.5 is also adding a new map, which seems neat, and Ultron, who will be the game’s first new strategist since Invisible Woman was added back in update season 1. He seems to be a healer who will be able to deal out a ton of damage in addition to delivering a lot of healing. Interestingly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase is also planning to add a full-on new mode to <em>Rivals</em></a></span>. You’ll be able to play an autochess-like game inside <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2.5 and will command your minions as Ultron. Weird!</p><p>Lastly, a reminder that moving forward and starting in season 3, seasons will only be two months long instead of three, and there won’t be any more .5 mid-season refreshes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will also get a new hero every month once this new schedule is in place. That sounds hard to balance to me, but hey, who doesn’t like new toys? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Lead investigations, uncover grand conspiracies, master tactical combat, and wage a secret war against heresy. Make tough choices as a conduit of the God-Emperor’s will.</p><p><strong>Innocence Proves Nothing</strong></p><p>Embrace the role of an Inquisitor in the grim darkness of the far future in a cRPG set in the rich Warhammer 40,000 universe. Start your service as an acolyte of the Inquisition: Investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and shape the fate of the Calixis Sector in a story-rich experience where every decision has weight, justice is non-existent, and the line between salvation and damnation is razor-thin. Explore an in-depth depiction of the Inquisition as an organization and the vast force it commands: its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As an Inquisitor, you have one primary goal: to protect the Imperium, whether that be from the taint of xenos, the betrayal of heretics, or the scourge of mutants, by any means necessary. Be the conduit of the Emperor’s will in a place where all hope was lost decades ago, explore the mysteries of the maddening Tyrant Star, and overcome the worst horrors thrown at you by the Noctis Aeterna.</p></blockquote><!-- zp_shiv error: no images in gallery! --><blockquote><p><strong>Uncover the Truth, No Matter the Cost</strong></p><p>Your duty is to investigate heresy deep within the Calixis Sector. Your craft is to expose the hidden rot in places where no one else dares to look, to be the final defense of Humanity in the face of annihilation. Uncover nefarious plots, interrogate suspects, and piece together conspiracies in a deep investigative system. The only question is, how far are you willing to go on the path of damnation in the name of salvation?</p><p><strong>You Are Not <a title="Games > Alone in the Dark (2024) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/alone-in-the-dark-2024">Alone in the Dark</a>ness</strong></p><p>Every Inquisitorial warband is unique, and yours is no exception. Ranging from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each and every one of them offers distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues.</p><p><strong>Fight on Your Terms</strong></p><p>Turn-based combat rewards careful planning and ruthless efficiency: target enemy weak points and keep each party member’s morale high to gain the upper hand in every battle. Managing their individual morale effectively will maximize their combat potential. Complex yet elegant systems ensure deep interactivity, making every decision in combat impactful and every kill brutally satisfying.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p>Each army in Warhammer 40,000 has its own codex containing rules, lore, and nice pictures, and The Leagues Of Votann's - the game's contemporary space dwarves - was out of date before a single model was available to buy. Advance copies went out, people noticed that the rules were horribly broken, more people noticed that the rules were actually massively, horribly, absurdly broken, and the company issued an apology, pulling out their <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2CjuqDSg/leagues-of-votann-balance-update-a-word-from-james-workshop/">cutesy 'James Workshop' moniker</a> in an attempt to aw shucks the fact they'd just sold everyone some very expensive hardback kindling. They later issued some rules errata, and they're supposedly in a more sensible spot now, even if doing anything interesting with them visually is confined, as per, <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Grendl-Grendlsen-Squat-Bounty-Hunter-2018">to Necromunda</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to bet money on it, I'd guess they won't be nearly as broken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2</a> when they appear as potential allies or foes for both the Ad-mech and Necron playable factions. That's because difficulty balance was one of the major problems holding the original Mechanicus back from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> greatness (the game was later patched), so I imagine it being at the forefront of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> Studio's mind this time. Decide for yourself by observing the trailer below. How many busted tokens do these dwarves have in their beards?</p>

<p>If you skipped the first Mechanicus, it was notable for a couple of things: an absurdly entertaining action economy that let your late game popebots sweep maps without stopping for breath (do Ad-mech breathe?) and a soundtrack that felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU">pipe organ had gained sentience</a> and declared war on reality itself. It was, balance aside, a good time, and I'm interested to see what Bulwark have learned from their first outing.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the game's Steam page lists the release date as TBA, but the presser I received reckons it's out sometime this year. This may be old news by the time you're reading this, by which time hundreds of billions of cells in my body will have been replaced. A truly antiquated and wasteful biological system I wouldn't have to deal with if the machine god would simply bless my digusting, fallible flesh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Accompanied by her brother Michael you will traverse unfamiliar places, character conflicts, and story affecting decision making. You have the power to help the world or let it rot. Careful your presence has caught the attention of something sinister…</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Many indie <a title="Genres > RPG [17,266 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> claim to be a new quirky game, but <em>Away From Home</em> is a mix of many great RPGs. The characters are full of emotion and let you empathize with them. Don’t forget that this world needs you.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Imagine if a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> and a Rhythm game had a love child. This game plays like Earthbound when it comes to walking and talking in it’s overworld, but when it comes to missions and battles it throws in <a title="Genres > Rhythm [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> related to the event. Characters also have real voices to help create mood and feeling to them. The big highlight of the gameplay is the huge amount of animations. The characters in this world are alive and through your gameplay you will begin to understand.</p><p>The amount of things to do in locations are never ending. Chocked full of lengthy side missions that unlock you new moves and items as well as random chance based events. The progression of side quests and random town events are based from entertaining games such as <em><a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> 0</em>!</p><p>The world is large and will take you hours to complete everything, not to mention alternate routes that bring replayability. Some routes include game changing decisions as well as items and battles you wouldn’t be able to do had you made different choices.</p><p><strong>Battles</strong></p><p>The battles are in a third-person view with rhythm-based function. The UI has a fight button, special button, items button, and block button. Using arrow keys your <a title="Genres > Action [2,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will be in sync with the music. If you press a key on the beat, you gain action points for special attacks.</p><p>For the first time, skill and strategy are balanced out by the battle system. You will need to use skill to time your choices and hits in time. Mean while you will need to use strategy to counteract opponents special attacks. Such as if you have an opponent with poison, you will want to apply anti poison items in your arsenal. Both you planning and action will be put to the test.</p><p>Items are unlocked by completion of side quests and can be purchased at the stores, some items are very powerful and can only be received once. You must plan three items to bring into battle and have immediately available. As well as unlock special moves that pair well with your arsenal.</p><p>The battles are stocked full of special effects to keep the fight lively! Rather than being told what’s happening around you like in a traditional RPG, you will get to witness everything from falling confetti to flashes of lightning!</p><p>Enemies have special attacks as well. Enemy specials send you into a full on quick time event with high detailed pixel art. Where you must hit provided keys. Failure to hit them in time results in major damage taken.</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>This game has may talented artists including yours truly. We bring life to the game in visually stunning ways. We focus on facial expression as well as detailed animation. Many people have poured their souls into this project. Some animations in the game took over 100 hours and I’m exited for you to see them.</p><p>We hope to convey emotion and expression in ways similar to games like Mother 3. With the high rendered detail in this game, every pixel counts. One pixel could change frown to a smile. So attention to detail goes a long way.</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>This game has an outstanding soundtrack so far. Music determines so much in a game such as mood, atmosphere, and tension. The original soundtrack has many amazing artists including NickNuwe, Chaotrope, Zakku, and Nelward.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Altogether, over 200 for the ‘jukebox,’” Asahi <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">said</a> when asked about the total number of musical pieces in Mario Kart World. “These are all brand-new arrangements, and we also did live recordings. We prepared pieces from quite a wide variety of musical genres. I believe those who are well-versed in video game music, as well as those who aren’t, will enjoy listening to them.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Asahi is asked about the challenge of crafting background music and integrating tracks into Mario Kart World’s open world design. Asahi explained music for the designated courses came first, then the open world parts of the game.</p><p>“First, we created music for the courses like we’ve always done before and then thought about what to do for the roads outside the courses,” Asahi said. “We decided to have two different kinds of music depending on how you’re playing. For the Knockout Tour mode, we started off by simply trying to connect the course themes. But that approach didn’t work well. It ended up sounding weird because the tracks have different tempos and beats. So, we decided to find a way to end each of the course themes, even though they’re connected by the route.</p><p>“Video game music often plays on a loop, and in this game, too, the same music keeps playing if you’re driving laps around a course. But for Knockout Tour, as you get closer to the next course, the music transitions to the outro, so the theme ends nicely. We also created a new intro for each course theme, which starts to play shortly before you reach the gate, building excitement.

			<p>Contrary to<a href="https://wccftech.com/insider-suggests-a-playstation-event-wont-happen-until-september-rumor/"> previous rumors</a>, Sony may not skip this year's "Not-E3" season, as a PlayStation State of Play is reportedly scheduled for June.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-BnQ9OIHOg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings</a>, the ever-reliable Jeff Grubb commented on the next PlayStation event, saying that, like Nate the Hate, he didn't hear anything about a May event, because there is one planned for June. The event, however, will probably not be a big one. The publisher has been going back and forth between showcase and PlayStation State of Play for a while, and has probably settled on a State of Play event for next month. Interestingly enough, Jeff Grubb highlighted how "abnormally difficult" it was to obtain this information, so there's definitely something going on behind the scenes at Sony.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game Mess Mornings 05/22/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-BnQ9OIHOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been a while since Sony hosted big PlayStation showcases, so there's a solid chance that Jeff Grubb provided once again correct information. As for which games will be showcased during the next PlayStation State of Play event, no information has been provided, although it would be a safe bet to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yōtei </a>during the event. As the PlayStation 5 port of Starfield is supposedly getting revealed, and shortly after released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, showing it during the event would make tons of sense, although this is mere speculation as the timing of the reveal is not yet known.</p>

        <p>Microsoft have "taken measures" to reduce "politically focused emails", says spokesperson</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly blocking employee internal work emails that contain the words "Palestine" or "Gaza". The report in question comes from No Azure For Apartheid (NOAA), a group of Microsoft workers formed to protest the company's then-alleged supplying of AI tech to the Israeli military - something Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">have since confirmed</a>, while also stating that their own internal reviews found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“NOAA believes this is an attempt by Microsoft to silence worker free speech and is a censorship enacted by Microsoft leadership to discriminate against Palestinian workers and their allies," spokesperson and former Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/672312/microsoft-block-palestine-gaza-email">The Verge</a> (paywalled) in a statement. Nasr added that "words like ‘Israel’ or ‘P4lestine’ do not trigger such a block".</p>
<p>When asked for comment by The Verge, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw responded with the below:</p>
<p>“Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate. We have an established forum for employees who have opted in to political issues. Over the past couple of days, a number of politically focused emails have been sent to tens of thousands of employees across the company and we have taken measures to try and reduce those emails to those that have not opted in.”</p>
<p>As The Verge note, the reported email blocks follow a week of employee protests about the company's dealings with the Israeli military. There have also been protests during Microsoft's Build developer conference this week. On Monday, former employee Joe Lopez <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670812/microsoft-build-protest-keynote-jay-parikh-palestinian-tech-worker">interrupted</a> CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote by shouting “how about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”, before sending emails to "thousands" of colleagues. Microsoft fired Lopez on the same day.</p>
<p>The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">currently calling on the public to boycott Microsoft's wares</a>, including Xbox products like Game Pass. The BDS organisers include Nasr and Abdo Mohamed, another former Microsoft employee. They were both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired after organising a vigil for Palestinians</a> killed in Gaza outside the company’s Washington HQ.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the center of the faceplate you’ll find Geralt’s wolf medallion--complete with glowing red eyes. You’ll also find Glagolitic script littered throughout the gamepad, which is the same script used in The Witcher video games.</p><p>Tons of Easter eggs are hidden within the design, so you’ll have plenty to keep your eyes busy during loading screens. One of the coolest touches, however, is the triggers--these are different colors as a tribute to Geralt’s silver and steel swords.</p><p>Beyond the unique graphics, this is your standard Xbox controller. It’s equipped with a Share button, support for multiple devices (Xbox, PC, mobile), and boasts an ergonomic design that helped land it at the top of our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/" data-ref-id="1100-6473486">best Xbox controllers</a>.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition/8mzbmmcjzqk6" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition\/8mzbmmcjzqk6&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition/8mzbmmcjzqk6">The Witcher Special Edition Xbox Elite Series 2 Core</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition/8mzbmmcjzqk6" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition\/8mzbmmcjzqk6&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-the-witcher-3-10th-anniversary-special-edition/8mzbmmcjzqk6">$170</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Need something a bit more robust and better suited for competitive play?

It also benefits from a rechargeable battery that gets up to 40 hours of battery life--an upgrade from the base controller, which requires AA batteries.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Microsoft has been going all-out with special edition Xbox controllers. Earlier this year, we saw the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-limited-edition-xbox-controller-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-gamestop/1100-6530902/" data-ref-id="1100-6530902">Doom: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller</a>. Featuring bloody graphics and a color pattern inspired by the Doom Slayer’s armor, it quickly sold out at most locations (though a few spots still have it in stock). We’ve also seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-xbox-controller-and-headset-revealed-and-you-can-buy-them-now/1100-6515078/" data-ref-id="1100-6515078">Starfield Xbox Controller</a> and <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller-redfall-limited-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redfall Xbox Controllers</a>--all of which sold out fast. If these new Witcher controllers follow the same pattern, expect them to disappear soon.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499334" data-ratio="0.56412825651303" data-width="998" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499334"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg"></figure><p>The fun doesn’t end with The Witcher controllers, as CD Projekt Red also revealed a new <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1925550975504285893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox dynamic background</a>.
