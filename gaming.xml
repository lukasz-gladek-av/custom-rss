		<p>In a lot of ways it’s easier than ever to make an incredible looking game, thanks in no small part to the broad accessibility of Unreal Engine 5 to developers across the whole industry, and the technical baseline that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console provide.</p>
<p>But visual design isn’t just about how many pixels you can throw around the screen, how many polygons you can zoom in on or how realistic everything can look. There’s absolutely a place for that – especially when you can apply it in new and unusual ways – but it’s also so important to have an individualistic streak and a real artistry to make a game stand out from the hyper realistic crowds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor Refantazio</a> is the story of a boy who wants to build a fairytale world, but that means something rather different when he lives in a world of high fantasy. When his world already features a tribal caste system, where certain races have bat and dog physiologies, demon horns and angel wings, and institutional racism sees the more human-like tribes rising to the top, his dreams look much more mundane to our eye.</p>
<p>It all stems from a book&nbsp;that describes our modern world. Effectively, our version of a fairytale world has characters who dream of ours.</p>

<p>All of this takes a stunning visual design, with the book pages painting themselves in monochromatic watercolour as the story unfolds. This contrasts beautifully with the colourful and highly saturated overworld.&nbsp;And that’s before considering the anime sections or the ridiculous pedigree at this studio, with accolades from Persona to Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<p>The mix of styles and stylisation come together beautifully in Metaphor, which has an incredible story of coming together and overthrowing a corrupt and racist regime that runs alongside it. If you’re looking for the prettiest game of the year, you won’t find one better than Metaphor.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Empire of the Ants – Runner Up</h2>
<p>You know what ants look like in the real world? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/empire-of-the-ants-review/">Empire of the Ants</a> looks like that, but like, really close up. It’s pretty great… unless you have some kind of insect phobia.</p>
<p>Making use of Unreal Engine 5, it really is nearly photorealistic, but uses that to show us the world from a perspective that we very rarely have. The woods and gardens that Empire of the Ants plays out across play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created.</p>
<p><em>– Dom L</em></p>
<h2>Ultros – Runner Up</h2>
<p>If you ever wanted to know what its like to play a game that’s a 70s prog rock album cover, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros</a> is the answer to that. With artwork from El Huervo – of Hotline Miami cover art fame – this is more than just a step into the realms of psychadelia, the alien ship and world that you explore bombarding you with colours across its juxtaposition of organic and mechanical environments.</p>
<p>It’s an alien setting that blends into with the narrative and the gameplay, as you gradually explore this adapted metroidvania structure with a completely fresh set of eyes, needing to learn about the world, how to cultivate and nurture it through each cycle of the story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-4-is-currently-free-to-play-until-the-new-year-including-spiritborn-class/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment is currently allowing those who are interested in playing Diablo 4 the opportunity to play it for free across all platforms on which you can get the game. At the moment, a large amount of ARPG fans are flocking to Path of Exile 2, with the game currently available in Early Access if you purchase it. Path of Exile and Diablo have been compared since the dawn of their very existence together, and Path of Exile 2 is no different. If you find that Path of Exile 2 isn't treating you quite right, or you want a new experience, Diablo 4 is currently available to play for free, thanks to Blizzard.</p>
<p>Once again, Blizzard has brought back the Diablo 4 trial, but with a significant difference. While the trial typically just involves the base campaign, this time, players will get the opportunity to try out the new Spiritborn class from the recent expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a>. Players won't be able to play the latest expansion, but you'll get to take the new class for a test run and see if it's something you enjoy.</p>
<p>The trial for Diablo 4 is currently available on PC via <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle.net</a>, PlayStation, and Xbox. You'll be able to play the game for free until January 3, 2025. This gives you plenty of time to grind out the game, complete the campaign, and see if it's a game you'd be interested in playing in the future. Unfortunately, Diablo 4 isn't available as a free trial on Steam, so you won't be able to play it there if you are a PC user.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find that you were enjoying your time during the Diablo 4 free trial, the game is on sale for up to 40% off across all platforms, which is the perfect time to get a game that will provide you with lots of value for money, especially with the addition of new content through the new seasons, as well as the ability to play the brand new expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to purchase the game but want to play it, Diablo 4's base game is available through Game Pass on PC and Xbox, giving you the opportunity to try out the campaign for a significantly lower price than buying the game in its entirety. It does mean you won't have access to the expansion unless you purchase it, but that is a decision you can make later down the line.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-is-a-fun-game-and-a-terrible-adaptation.1066512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Squid Game</em>, schoolyard games are turned into nightmares, as players compete to survive and — if they’re lucky — earn a massive cash prize. But in <em>Unleashed</em>, a new mobile spinoff that’s part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">the streamer’s fledgling gaming efforts</a>, those games are <em>fun</em>. It’s a strange experience that sands off much of the appeal of <em>Squid Game</em> in service of making a multiplayer party game.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> is sort of like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> but in a <em>Squid Game</em> wrapper. You compete against 31 other players across three random games pulled from the show, like “red light, green light” or racing across a bridge made of glass. Slowly other players die off, and by the end one wins a whole bunch of money.</p><p>Aesthetically, the game mostly follows the show. There are a bunch of characters to play as — some pulled from the show, others new for the game — and even though there’s a cartoon aesthetic, things still get bloody, with players being shot for breaking the rules or crushed under some obstacle. There are the familiar green track suits and masked guards.</p><p>But the connections to the show are really only surface level. There’s no story element, so if you haven’t watched the show, you’d have no idea the kind of personal anguish many of the characters are going through.</p><p>In fact, many of the elements that make <em>Unleashed</em> a pretty fun mobile game are also what keep it from being a good adaptation of what <em>Squid Game</em> is all about. In order to reduce frustration, most of the games have respawning. So even if you fail at “red light, green light” and get shot by a guard, it’s not game over. It simply slows you down in a race to be one of a pre-determined number of players to cross the finish line and move on.</p><p>Similarly, the games can all be completed in a few minutes. This is great for playing short sessions on the go; being stuck in a 30 minute multiplayer match on your phone typically sucks. But when you put elements like the short run time and respawning together it, completely erases any of the tension that’s so core to <em>Squid Game</em>’s appeal.</p><p>And despite having no in-app purchases — <em>Unleashed</em> is completely free for Netflix subscribers and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319725/squid-game-for-everyone">for a limited time, non-subscribers</a> — it’s still structured like a typical free-to-play game. You earn cash from winning matches and completing various goals, which is used to unlock new characters, costumes, and emotes. Every time I log on I’m greeted with a jarring number of pop-ups and notifications letting me know I just unlocked a zombie costume or that there’s a Christmas-themed event going on. Just this morning I was gifted a twerking emote.</p><p>Yes, now I can make Kang Sae-byeok, whose death was one of the most tragic moments of season 1, twerk in the middle of a deadly obstacle course.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> isn’t a bad game. In many ways, it’s a clever reinterpretation of online party games for mobile. But, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23971416/squid-game-the-challenge-review-netflix">like most of Netflix’s expansions of the <em>Squid Game</em> universe</a>, it also completely misses the point of the show. It’s sort of like what <em>Fortnite</em> is to the original movie <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23851408/battle-royale-revisited-hunger-games-fortnite-squid-game-criterion"><em>Battle Royale</em></a>: a playful, colorful take on a brutal, piercing story.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> largely avoided the tonal dissonance by creating a cartoon-ish, multiversal world that is far away from an island full of kids killing their classmates. <em>Unleashed</em>, on the other hand, is another part of S<em>quid Game</em> — one that doesn’t seem to understand why the series exists.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, it’s incredibly fitting that he makes the cut as the runner up for the best Strategist in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His healing grenade launcher can quickly heal multiple allies at once. And his ultimate ability can help damage boost any surrounding allies, which can be a great boon in team fights.</p><p>Rocket’s best asset, though, is his revival ability: the Battle Revival Beacon. The B.R.B. can revive a single fallen ally, and it also produces armor packs. The beacon has a 45-second cooldown, but negating even one death is a huge boon. It can also help a costly mistake become nothing more than a small inconvenience. Adam Warlock has similar strengths in this department–especially with his Team-Up Ability–but Rocket’s ease of use and flexible healing output gives him a slight edge over the golden guy.</p><h2 id="h108668"><a id="jeff"></a>Jeff the Land Shark keeps your team healed better than anyone</h2><figure id="" data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s incredibly difficult to recommend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">anyone but Jeff</a></span> as the best healer in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.

Other healers like Loki and Cloak and Dagger also heal with their primary fire, but they all have much less ammo. On the other hand, Jeff just has a sustained beam that needs to be reloaded much less. Because of this, he can focus on a strong tank and let them wreak havoc. This is in addition to his fast movement speed, aided by his movement skill that lets him swim underwater while self-healing.</p><p>And to top it all off, there’s his ultimate. There’s no way to make this sound fancy or formal. Frankly, it’s absolutely wild that this is in a hero shooter. Jeff can swallow up both enemies and allies (in a <em>very generously large </em>area), and spit them wherever he’d like. nine times out of 10, this results in enemies being spit off of a cliff and the deaths of quite a few teammates. It sure can change the tide of a team battle in a flash. Don’t let his cute face fool you. Jeff is an absolute menace.</p><p><br><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.  </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Towers of Aghasba has officially been in Early Access for one month. Dreamlit Games has been talking about the experience thus far and the work they've been doing on the game to improve it during the<a href="https://wccftech.com/towers-of-aghasba-enters-early-access-on-november-19-bringing-a-world-of-cozy-exploration/"> Early Access</a> period. Since its release a month ago, the team has delivered five major patches in the span of four weeks, which added a significant amount of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and some extra features for players to dive into. While looking back at the month they've had, they have also remarked on what they plan on adding to the game to help it continue to grow and provide players with the fun, cozy experience that they've been longing for with this title. If you've yet to pick up Towers of Aghasba, the game is currently 20% off until January 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178070/Towers_of_Aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and 20% off on the PlayStation Store until January 6.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba - A Journey of Growth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra_mdW1P87k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back at some of the updates this game has seen already, it includes an Arachnophobia mode, which changes all spiders in the game to become crabs instead. Although crabs are relatively spider-adjacent. There has also been inventory expansion, allowing players to have an increased number of storage boxes, with more plans for inventory to come in the future.</p>
<p>One of the most favored changes that has been made to Towers of Aghasba is the need to make an Epic Games account. It is no longer necessary to create an Epic Games account to play this title, especially as the game is available on Steam.</p>
<p>There are plenty more changes in the works, with the team at Dreamlit Games currently working on a new major patch that would bring multiplayer co-op questing to the game, which is a feature that has been highly requested by those who are already dedicated players of the game.</p>
<p>Dreamlit Games has also outlined the content that they plan to bring to the game for the full launch. This includes six regions to explore, including forests, ruins, and more, allowing for a ton of discoveries to be made with new flora and fauna in each area. There will be three types of settlement to build, design, and decorate, as well as three types of ecosystems to grow to ensure that your town flourishes. Additionally, Towers of Aghasba will have both single-player and co-op gameplay, allowing you to play with up to three other people to help build and expand your island.</p>

"A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements", was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/menaces-turn-based-battles-are-the-galaxys-deadliest-teambuilding-exercises">Menace hands-on</a>, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.</p>
<p>And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.
</p><!--more-->

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/starmap_JS1IFGS.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Honestly, it all <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2432860/view/515196772511907866?l=english">sounds</a> pretty straightforward next to the difficulties of avoiding injury on the surface. Between missions, you'll return to a starmap of the Wayback solar system, on which you can see planets and the factions that own them, together with any requests for aid. There's a reputation management element - leave a faction request hanging and they might sour on you.
</p><p>
Faction distress calls aside, the starmap is where you'll spend the game's main resources. Promotion points are for levelling up squads, OCI components (that's "Operational Capability Improvements" - you're impressing nobody with this wanton jargon, Overhype) are for embiggening your ship, the Impetus, while authority points are for keeping a lid on your crew's morale and mood.</p>
<p>Your crew are described as "motley", which here means "a massive liability". You might have to intervene in a bar fight, or deal with the problem of a moonshine distillery, or resolve an accident in the hangarbay. It sounds like the usual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> rhythm of having to decide between fixing a problem now, or letting it slide to save resources and getting into hot water later.
</p>
<p>
As for ship upgrades, these have both active and passive benefits during missions. You can equip the Impetus with facilities that let you call in a dropship strafing run or a bunker-buster missile. Other enhancements restore unit health during missions, but the must-have is probably the one that gives you sharper intelligence on enemies and their position during briefings. Menace definitely feels like a game where reconnaissance trumps firepower.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/squadpromotion.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hooded Horse</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Last but not least, there's the armory screen, where you can choose from various weapons, armour, accessories and vehicles, and dole out promotions. Each squad leader has a unique perk tree, though some of the individual perks are shared between characters, and each squad leader starts with a trademark personal trait. Everybody is their own special snowflake. At least till they get stepped on by the mechs.</p>
<p>And that's it for the strategy stuff. Forthcoming in a future blogpost: details of the black market, where you can barter for gear, squad leaders and pilots, and of operations, which are a series of connected missions. 
</p>
<p>
I was vaguely hoping for a transformative gimmick of some kind, but it sounds like the strategy aspect of Menace is rather by the numbers. Still, that's the thing about bread, isn't it? If it's too exciting, the filling loses its potency. A sandwich in which the bread is the star component is no sandwich at all but a breadstick you've accidentally dropped in the stew - and whoops, now Lance Corporal Vicarus has clobbered you with a ladle because he's absolutely blotto after sampling the hooch they've been brewing behind the main reactor. Captain to the messhall, please! Menace is out later next year.

Was it the dark days where every single big blockbuster movie got a shitty tie-in video game crunched out by some poor dev team in six months to launch alongside the film? Or is it the present, where new movies rarely get tie-in games at all outside of the occasional throwaway mobile game? Yes, of course there are exceptions, but for every <em>Goldeneye 007</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, or <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, there are a dozen <em>E.T.</em>s, <em>Rambo</em>s, or <em>Fight Club</em>s. Meanwhile, we’ve finally got kind of a good thing going in the other direction, with enough quality movie/TV adaptations of games that an outright shitburger like <em>Borderlands</em> feels like a rare exception and not the rule. </p><div><p>I get it, games take longer and more effort to make, especially the kind of quadruple-A thing most film studios would prefer their cash-ins to look like. But here’s the secret sauce, kids: Most of the best movie-to-video-game adaptations aren’t even direct adaptations of a specific movie, but are instead parallel stories, spinoffs, off-brand prequels and sequels, and weird anthology tales existing in the same universe. <em>Star Wars </em>has been proving that theory right for decades now, but even ambitious-yet-average one-offs like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> have the right idea. </p><p>And that’s the sweet spot we’d like to look at, especially in the wake of the rather excellent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>: The games that took a film’s ball and ran with it. There’s quite a few of them, but here’s 10 that are especially worth your time. </p></div></div></div><div><p>Probably the indisputable winner of this entire list, if we’re honest. Creative Assembly took a good hard look at everything<em> Aliens: Colonial Marines</em> did and made the exact opposite of that. The extent to which <em>Isolation</em> applies pressure to the player and <em>dares</em> them to make a wrong move or make the wrong noise is breathtaking. Quite literally, too, if you turned on that option on select platforms where the alien can hear you through your controller, laptop, or camera microphone. And how gloriously sadistic is the fact that they even included that option?</p></div><div><p>There are elements of <em>The Thing</em> that show its age, especially the gunplay that becomes a drag once you start getting fewer alien monstrosities and more generic humans in your way. But wrapped around a fairly bog-standard survival horror game is a suite of brilliant mechanics that truly makes it feel harmonious with the Carpenter film of the same name. Once you start rescuing survivors, any one of them could be infected at any time, and deciding just how much to trust them–or not–with resources and tasks still feels tense and unique. Nightdive Studios just shadow-dropped a very pretty remaster of the game. It’s still very much worth a look today as it was back in 2002 when it first arrived. </p></div><div><p>Here we have the rarest of rare scenarios: <em>Escape From Butcher Bay </em>is a game that is an outright triumph in every way the film it was meant to tie-in with is not. Yes, there’s still a goofy charm to <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em>: The Film, the kind of bro-ey nerd charm you can only get from one Vincent Diesel, Esq. It actually feels more like a one-shot <em>D&amp;D/Warhammer</em> campaign than anything else, and nobody was even attempting that in 2004. </p><p><br><em>Escape from Butcher Bay</em>, however, is every inch the sequel to <em>Pitch Black</em> the world needed and wanted. The game is a down and dirty, stealthy prison escape scenario with an excellent “see-in-the-dark” mechanic, awash in character actors, and <em>a lot </em>of Riddick shanking people in the spine. And the game pulled all this off while still serving some satisfying Furyan lore expansion. For some reason, we haven’t gotten 10 sequels to this yet.   </p></div><div><p>Oh sure, there’s an argument to be made that <em>Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War</em> are the better games to include here, considering how much of their presentation is lifted from the Peter Jackson films. However, I’d argue for a more unique experience, look no further than <em>The Third Age.</em> As literally anyone who plays it for five minutes can tell you, the game is basically just <em>Final Fantasy X</em> in Middle Earth. Thing is, what seemed like a derivative choice in 2004 feels far more novel in 2024. The story, with a kind of parallel Fellowship ensuring the A-team gets to Mount Doom, runs roughshod over the established canon, but the group’s backstories are all solid enough to maintain interest for the entire play time, and hey, least they don’t do anything too stupid like, say, oh, idk, for instance, make Shelob a goth baddie, or make the last thicc female Ent fight a Balrog. </p></div><div><p>Every once in a while, somebody threatens to try and do a new <em>Back to the Future</em>, or maybe turn that Broadway musical into a film. Meanwhile, Telltale got there first, with the help of series screenwriter Bob Gale, and a smattering of the original cast in tow, all putting in work. The first two episodes are a little on the sillier side, with a jaunt to Prohibition-era Hill Valley. But once the busybody ancestor of Principal Strickland gets involved with Doc Brown, resulting in Hill Valley being turned into a techno-dystopia, things are drastically more interesting. It’s a damn shame the ending–which managed to rope in Michael J. Fox while introducing some multiverse shenanigans back when that was still cool–never went anywhere. What we’ve got instead is still the one and only time this series has ever been expanded upon in a meaningful way. </p></div><div><p>Look, I love <em>GTA V</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, but every damn day, I mourn that the Rockstar Games that had time to pump out games that weren’t <em>GTA</em> appears to be in a coma. Don’t even get me started on how much I miss <em>Midnight Club</em>, we’ll be here all day. But above all, we don’t talk enough about the one time Rockstar decided to play in someone else’s cinematic sandbox to give us not just one of the best takes on a 3D beat-’em-up we’d get (until the <em>Yakuza</em> games finally started to gain traction in the West), but also one of the best movie adaptations all around. <em>The Warriors</em> takes a cult classic film literally nobody was even paying attention to in 2005, and breathes new life into it. The game isn’t just an adaptation, but is an expansive prequel starring most of the same cast. This thing has been long overdue for a remaster, but alas, Rockstar would have to pull people off of lovingly modeling every strand of a meth head’s chest hair in <em>GTA Online</em> to do it. </p></div><div><p>It’s always a mistake whenever someone says <em>Bond </em>films are all just dumb action flicks, especially the Daniel Craig era. But to be fair, the Pierce Brosnan flicks weren’t shy about being exactly what they were, until they parasurfed way too close to the sun with <em>Die Another Day</em>. Quality of the films notwithstanding, it made total sense that Brosnan would end up getting the best Bond game ever made (<em>Goldeneye 007</em>’s aged, and you know it. Why are you booing me? I’m right). <em>Everything or Nothing</em> is just a wild-ass ride from beginning to end, with enormous action set pieces no film would be able to budget for without bankrupting England. It’s frankly shocking it didn’t, considering the staggering amount of star power EA managed to rope into this. The game features Brosnan himself, as well as Judi Dench, John Cleese, and even Willem Dafoe as the baddie.Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum star as Bond girls, and Mya does the theme song (which is still a bop). This is just straight up, spared-no-expense AAA shit right here, a game that actually feels like a later <em>Uncharted</em> sequel long before anyone even heard the name Nathan Drake. </p></div><div><p>Ask virtually anyone about what they think a <em>John Wick</em> video game should be, chances are good the answer is something that resembles <em>Max Payne</em> or <em>Hotline Miami</em>. Nobody’s first answer would’ve been <em>John Wick Hex</em>, and yet after playing it, one will find themselves wondering “Why wasn’t it?” <em>John Wick Hex</em> is a strategy game that puts you in the head of the Baba Yaga, where every little consideration of the killzones he finds himself in must be accounted for to escape without taking a bullet, and it’s only after you’ve done the legwork that you actually get to see the dope, bone-crushing, headshotting glory. It’s also working with a really cool cel-shaded art style, and really, though, it’s just cool to see John <em>as</em> the Baba Yaga, the guy still building his legend instead of the legend. </p></div><div><p>Out of everything else in this list, <em>Terminator: Resistance</em> is shocking in the fact that nothing about its pedigree gives the indication that it might be playable let alone often good. Look at developer Teyon’s resume prior to this, and it is a long, depressing list of straight up shovelware for the Wii and 3DS. Hell, their last licensed game is the dreadful PS3 <em>Rambo</em> rail shooter I mentioned at the start. Somehow, those guys managed to pull off <em>Fallout</em>-but-with-<em>Terminators</em>, and did it in a way that doesn’t outstay its welcome the way too many of the <em>Fallout </em>games do. We used to get stuff like this all the time in the PS2 era. Now, a AA game taking a road-less-traveled with a big property is one of those swings nobody makes. But when they do, it often winds up being a delightfully wonky treat. </p></div><div><p>It’s not exactly a surprise when WayForward manages to make a pretty passable game out of a tie-in property nobody cares about, let alone a legitimately fun, cool Metroidvania, but in <em>The Mummy Demastered</em>’s case, the team found themselves in the wild position of crafting the only shining positive about an absolute shitshow of a project. <em>The Dark Universe</em> is still a punchline in the annals of recent film history (though we did get that great Elisabeth Moss <em>Invisible Man</em> out of it), but the game is surprisingly pretty forward thinking in a few ways. Specifically, it’s got more of a <em>Souls</em>-like approach to the way it handles death, in that, as a nameless grunt, completing the mission means heading into darkened tombs, having to take down your predecessor if you want any of your inventory back. All it really needed was a trailer with a pixel-art Tom Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming in the center sound channel of your TV</a></span>. </p><hr></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's the season of giving, and Steam has a free gift up for grabs to keep you entertained over the holidays.</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 is a 2D arcade shooter set in--you guessed it--distant space, and is currently available for anyone to claim for free on Steam. A sequel to the original Space Distant, developer PixelMouse aptly describes the game as "an indirect continuation of the first part" that features "more dynamic gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 challenges players to pilot a spaceship through 26 levels of enemies, including three special boss ships, which PixelMouse says are especially challenging. On the bright side, players can find unique weapons by destroying and looting enemy ships, which will make those boss fights a little less daunting.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your task is to destroy enemy ships on each level to go to the next of 26 available [levels]," the game's Steam page reads. "In addition to conventional ships, you will have to wait for the boss ships, the battle with which will not be easy."</p><p>Distant Space 2 is currently available to play for free on Steam (download it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729460/Distant_Space_2/" rel="nofollow ">here</a>), but this no-strings-attached gift won't be around forever, so players will want to add this title to their library before the 100% discount expires on December 24 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. If you prefer to play its predecessor first, you can get your hands on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5251/Distant_Space_Pack/" rel="nofollow ">Space Distant and Distant Space 2</a> for only $0.73 USD.</p><p>For even more Steam-powered savings, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2024-game-deals/2900-6097/" data-ref-id="2900-6097">the best deals featured in this year's Steam Winter Sale</a>.</p>

            <p>NetEase's PvPvE sandbox action horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">Once Human, started testing its mobile port back in September</a>, and now we <em>finally</em> have a mobile release window: April 2025.</p>
<p>In an end-of-year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc00VaAEgfM">livestream</a>, NetEase also revealed what new features Meta-Humans can expect when the mobile version drops, including three new scenarios: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The latter is a 10-day PvP scenario, whilst the first two are PvE.</p>

<p>We'll also get to experience the all-new Visional Wheel from 16th January, which introduces new wrinkles to gameplay courtesy of new weapons, powers, and rules, as well as making enemies stronger and adversely impacting player sanity. Oh, and there'll be a holiday event running across Christmas and the new year, too.</p>
<p>Once Human is also expected to come to console - complete with cross-platform support - as well. There's still no date on that, though. Sorry.</p>
<p>Interested? Head on over to the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/">official website</a> to pre-register your interest now. Right now, over 26 million Meta-Humans have signed up, unlocking a slew of free gifts including cosmetics, skins, decorative items, and crafting resources.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p><p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2024, we saw games where soldiers dove headfirst into alien planets to defend Earth, Princess Zelda led her very own legend, a little robot overcame impossible odds to rescue PlayStation’s greatest characters, and a game of poker played out unlike anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There can be arguments for why any number of our Best Game of 2024 nominees could take home the crown, a stark contrast from last year where Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were locked-in favorites. The breadth of games on display, from Black Myth: Wukong to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, means picking this year’s winner was harder than usual, but ultimately there was one clear winner. Here’s IGN’s Best Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get to the overall winner, let’s look back at some of the other games from this year that deserve your recognition, starting with our Honorable Mentions. These nominees were much-loved by IGN’s editorial team but didn’t get as many votes as our winner and runners-up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Rise of the Golden Idol</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/theriseofthegoldenidollaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1731437713897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery is afoot in the sequel to 2022’s delightful point-and-click game The Case of the Golden Idol. Set 200 years after the events of the first game, Rise of the Golden Idol returns with more devilishly clever puzzles where you solve various crimes that begin to combine into one grand mystery.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Infinity Nikki</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/infinitynikki-gameplay-blogroll-1732139672495.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fashion Nikki series has always had its share of devotees. The dress-up simulator was a pleasant, cozy way to pass the time, collecting different outfits and making your character as cute as they can be. But Infinity Nikki is a bold reinvention, combining all the elements fans loved, along with the amazing outfits they could create, and adding a vibrant, Zelda-like open-world to explore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/19/ign-silent-hill-2-never-played-ep2-thumbnail-oo-1726776383592.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There were doubts as to whether Bloober Team could faithfully remake one of the most beloved horror games of all time. Even Bloober admitted as much, citing the mixed reception some of their previous horror games have received. But the determination to do right by the source material paid off as Silent Hill 2 delivers one of the scariest – and best – gaming experiences of the year. Faithful to everything that made the original great, while updating the rusty, aging bits beautifully, Silent Hill 2 embodies everything that’s great about the original and then some.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/11/princethumb-1704993410690.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prince of Persia, one of gaming's forgotten greats, finally got a new entry worthy of the Prince’s title. This 2.5D Metroidvania delivers one of the most exhilarating revivals of any franchise in recent memory, and with its tight controls, excellent action, and swashbuckling storytelling, this is the best Prince of Persia game since Sands of Time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/blackmythwukong-1726515688801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong captivated audiences ever since its first trailer was revealed, but that was only a part of the story. Yes, the boss fights are epic, and the combat is sublime, but this loving recreation of one of China’s oldest, most beloved stories means millions of players can finally appreciate the legend of the Monkey Prince in a whole new way.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Animal Well</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/09/animalwellgameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll1-1675960235640.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the earliest surprises of the year was Animal Well. On the surface, it’s another well-made homage to past 2D Metroidvania games. But the deeper you go, the more you realize Animal Well isn’t all that it appears. While the core gameplay and platforming are excellent, you quickly discover there’s a massive puzzle at the heart of it all. So take out your notebook and get ready to put your brain to work to uncover the truth behind Animal Well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/indianajones-thumb-1734054378637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up are games that were oh-so-close to being crowned Game of the Year, but narrowly missed out to the overall winner. MachineGames is back with another Nazi-punching blockbuster. And no, this isn’t a new Wolfenstein game. Instead, the Swedish studio has endeavored to bring one of cinema’s greatest heroes into the modern gaming age. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is essentially a truly great Indiana Jones movie brought to life. And by truly great, we mean up there with the original trilogy. Buoyed by Troy Baker’s frankly insane portrayal of Harrison Ford’s iconic archeologist, The Great Circle feels like a dream come true for anyone who grew up enraptured by movies like The Last Crusade and Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy was never a shoot ‘em up hero; instead he used his brains as well as his brawn to solve ancient riddles and punch out bad guys, and that’s something MachineGames has wonderfully adapted here. Whether it’s exploring the ancient catacombs of The Vatican or sneaking up on fascists and bonking them over the head, The Great Circle literally puts you into the dirt-caked shoes of Indiana Jones, and it turns out it’s every bit as fun and exciting as we imagined.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/blogroll-thumbnail-1727407554384.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why is it called The Legend of Zelda if it stars Link?” is a question most have asked at one point in their life. Well, ask no more as Echoes of Wisdom puts Zelda in charge of her own legend in this new top-down adventure game. Visually similar to the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom is very much a true Zelda game, complete with the classic puzzles and dungeons the series is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its creators have clearly learned from more recent games in the series too, and even though Echoes of Wisdom is more of a “classic” Zelda experience, the freeform creativity of Breath of the Wild is present thanks to the Echoes mechanic that lets Zelda conjure whatever item and enemy she encounters, leading to all kinds of madcap solutions. Stuck on the other side of a ledge? Just stack a bunch of beds together to cross. Duh.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Helldivers 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/12/hd2-blog-1709811363355-1715480666596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you doing your part in the war to save our galaxy? If not, jump into Helldivers 2 and start blasting away at alien and robot scum. Arrowhead Game Studios delivered one of the new live-service games of the year with the sequel to its isometric alien shooter. Reimagined as a squad-based third-person shooter, Helldivers 2 is both a satirical take on the military-industrial complex while also being an addictive blast thanks to its potent mix of high-powered weaponry, devastating orbital drop missiles, and a spirit of Earthian patriotism.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/finalfantasyviirebirth-review-blogroll-1708556006533.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After the prelude that was Final Fantasy 7: Remake, we finally get to the heart of the adventure in the second in Square Enix’s planned trilogy. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth encompasses some of the most important moments from the original, but more than that stands on its own as a brilliant open world RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What stands out almost immediately is how much love Square Enix has for these characters. It’s clear Square Enix wants players to spend as much time as they can with Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barrett, and Red XIII, providing plenty of side quests and minigames, and expanding entire moments so that we can all spend just hang with the gang some more before they resume their mission in the fight against Sephiroth. It makes these moments all the more valuable too, given the ending to Rebirth and the approaching finale.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Astro Bot</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/astrosbot-1717108957666.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot’s life began as a humble mascot for the Playroom tech demo. Anytime Sony had some new hardware to show off — whether it was the PS VR headset, or the PlayStation 5 — Astro Bot was there to guide players through the ins-and-outs of whatever new system Sony wanted to show off. But with Astro Bot, the adorable little mascot finally takes center stage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This colorful, vibrant 3D platformer isn’t just a showcase for the PS5’s powerful GPU and fast SSD, because between the unbridled level of creativity in each level and the controller-stressing difficulty of some of the harder challenge runs, Astro Bot is pure delight and wonderment. Every ability Astro Bot plays around with — from inflating into a balloon or punching enemies with bungee fists — never fails to amuse even the most hardened gamer. I don’t say this lightly, but PlayStation might have just found its answer to Nintendo’s Mario. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragonage-storysofar-blogroll-1731090586531.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief interlude into the live-service genre with games like Anthem, and a perhaps ill-advised attempt to rush out another Mass Effect game with Mass Effect: Andromeda, BioWare has gone back to what it knows best – a good old-fashioned, dungeon-crawling RPG full of delightful characters, witty dialogue, and the chance to create a character who looks and talks exactly the way you want them to. But while BioWare may have opted for a back-to-basics approach to storytelling, there is one area of major improvement: the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not unfair to say this is the best a BioWare game has ever played, from its sword-and-sorcery combat to even the way you traverse the myriad of dungeons and mystical locales. While we’re only one game into the BioWare renaissance, all eyes are back on the storied studio.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Balatro</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/24/balatroreleasedatetrailer-ign-blogroll-1706114330757.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just a poker game with some roguelike mechanics,” I remember saying to friends, incredulously, when they first told me they spent all night playing a little game called Balatro. “How good could it be?” Turns out after tens of thousands of poker hands and hundreds of hours spent playing, Balatro still has me wrapped around its fingers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot can be said about Balatro’s addictive qualities and how it has this magnetic ability to get you to play just one more round. The reason for Balatro’s rapid ascendency is how it took one of America’s oldest games and refashioned it for one of gaming’s most popular genres, the roguelike. The combination of classic poker rules and randomized Joker and Tarot cards that augment your combos and bump up your high score so you can get to the next round is pure gaming bliss. Balatro is built on creating seemingly endless moments of elation and devastation in equal measures. All you have to do is play your cards right… literally.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner:<strong> Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/24/metaphorign-1724474565097.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For years, Atlus’ cult-RPG Persona went from being a cool underground RPG series from Japan to one of the biggest franchises in modern gaming. But with Metaphor: ReFantazio, it’s clear the developers behind Persona were seeking to push themselves to new heights. Trading in the modern-day Japanese high school setting for a pure fantasy world full of long-eared knights and bat-like ninjas, Atlus’ Studio Zero has created an incredible and timely meditation on political strife and demagoguery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the death of the King, the United Kingdom of Euchronia, divided by racial prejudice among its citizens, begins the process of holding its very first popular election that kickstarts a grand, cross-continental adventure. For anyone familiar with the Persona series, you’ll find familiar hallmarks here. Players split their time crawling through difficult dungeons full of horrifying monsters, while spending free moments building up relationships with various party members and inhabitants around the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the Persona games took these quiet moments to reaffirm the virtues of youthful friendships, Metaphor uses these times to tackle headier questions. What defines a knight’s duty, or the responsibilities of those born into wealth? Can one ever heal from the pains of racism, and is religious tolerance a foolhardy endeavor? These aren’t easy questions to address but are asked plainly throughout Metaphor’s 70-hour playtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Studio Zero refrains from giving clear-cut answers to these questions, it instead acknowledges the virtues of empathy, kindness, and strength in the face of overwhelming fear and hatred that can take root in an uncertain world where leaders promise salvation in exchange for unwavering loyalty. Wrap these philosophical musings in a stylish, turn-based RPG that looks and feels stupendous — complete with beautiful character designs from artist Shigenori Soejima and music from Shoji Meguro – and you’ll quickly understand why Metaphor: ReFantazio is IGN’s pick for Best Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So congratulations to Metaphor: ReFantazio and Studio Zero, and also to all of our other winners and runner-ups in 2024’s IGN Awards.

Larian has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more">Patch 8 is Baldur’s Gate 3’s last major update</a>, with the developer moving on to brand new games away from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Patch 8 stress test build is set to go live in January, Larian said in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538840670729666668" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>. It will be available to players on PC via Steam, and on console via Xbox and PlayStation. GOG and Mac players do not have access. The <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form for registering interest</a> is live now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian said it wants to "rigorously" test Patch 8 for instability or gameplay issues before it comes out. “With your help, we’ll be able to keep an eye on any funny business,” the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this is testing crossplay. "Bringing crossplay to a game the size of Baldur’s Gate 3 has been no easy task," Larian explained, "and we want your help to test-drive this new functionality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Share the stress test registration link to summon your friends and settle in for a crossplay campaign, or head to the Larian Studios Discord Server to look for a group to play with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Supported mods “should” remain free of issues, but the stress test will hopefully turn up any issues mods might have interacting with Patch 8 features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Patch 8 is Baldur's Gate 3's last major update, Larian has promised to continue to support the game's modders, with “big updates still to come,” including more functionality “to let you tell your own stories.” Official mod tools were released in September, and since then players have uploaded more than 3,000 mods and downloaded over 70 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Larian said it’s winding down mod curation for consoles during the holiday season. It’ll pick back up again in the new year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new game called <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Captain Laserhawk: The Game</a>, which is a top-down multiplayer shooter that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology. It's currently in early access on PC and somehow features Rayman.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the game is based on the Netflix show Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which itself is based on the Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon spin-off. In Captain Laserhawk: The Game, Rayman is simply the announcer for deathmatches, so he's not actually playable.</p><p>The game requires players to have a Niji Warrior NFT to play. A Rayman profile picture can also be purchased for 750 virtual coins and attached to your Niji Warrior NFT. That's pretty much the extent of Rayman's involvement in this game. Ubisoft has quietly released this game to little fanfare, as there aren't many social media posts even acknowledging its existence outside of a few <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium posts</a>.</p><p>NFTs were a hot topic a few years ago, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-and-ea-executives-are-big-believers-in-nfts/1100-6497712/" data-ref-id="1100-6497712">Electronic Arts, Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-there-will-be-10000-characters-in-its-nft-game/1100-6512348/" data-ref-id="1100-6512348">Square Enix</a> vouched for them. However, the sentiment has died down considerably as the industry pivoted into the next tech craze: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-with-ai/1100-6520074/" data-ref-id="1100-6520074">AI.</a></p><p>Ubisoft had an NFT platform called Quartz, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-backlash-over-nft-program/1100-6500076/" data-ref-id="1100-6500076">received backlash</a> when it was first announced. Ubisoft also experimented with NFTs for Ghost Recon Breakpoint, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-support-has-ended/1100-6502187/" data-ref-id="1100-6502187">ended support for the game</a> in 2022.</p>

            <p>A video game charting the true story of the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, has secured three-quarters of its <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">crowdfunding goal</a> with over three weeks still to go.</p>
<p>Dreams on a Pillow - a "pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land" - tracks Omm, a young mother from an olive farmers' family in al-Tantura.

<p>The crowdfunding page explains that Palestinian game developer Rasheed Abueideh is "asking for your support and blessing as he sets out on his largest game project so far, which has been a dream of his for almost a decade". To date, it has realised £104.5K of the £155,823 Abueideh seeks to raise and is set to close on 13th January.</p>
<p>"Almost exactly a decade ago, as an Israeli invasion tore through Gaza, Rasheed Abueideh recognised the power of games: they let players step into someone else’s reality," the description explains.</p>
<p>"Not long after Rasheed began development of Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War, a game that brought to life the harsh realities of living under invasion, apartheid, &amp; occupation. The development was fraught with obstacles and rejections: Apple declared the game 'too political', and temporarily banned the game - and while publishing funding in the games industry were aggressively funding games, a Palestinian game was deemed 'too controversial'. Rasheed persevered, and Liyla became a global phenomenon."</p>
<p>Abueideh said Dreams on a Pillow is "proof that games can tell the stories of anyone, anywhere". For more, <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">head on over to the crowdfunding page</a>, where pledges range from £24 to £8000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Black Desert continues to get updates, with new classes and new content added to the game all the time. Most recently, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light: Seoul expansion</a> was released, where players were taken to Ancient Korea, where they could explore architecture, meet new characters, and fight off new enemies in the expansion. Today, it's been announced that the new gunslinging class, Deadeye, is available in early access. Those who want the opportunity to try out Deadeye will be able to go through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7956&amp;countryType=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Desert Global Lab</a>, where you'll get to experiment with the class' revolvers, shotgun, and Lil' Devil.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Pearl Abyss marked a decade of Black Desert at Calpheon Ball, which is a global community event that took place at the Suwon Messe in South Korea. For those unable to attend, the event was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlI-kQ6MCew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-streamed</a>, and players got to see a ton of announcements unveiled as a celebration of the game's longevity.</p>
<p>The 29th class for Black Desert will be launching worldwide on Black Desert Online and Black Desert Mobile on December 24. Additionally, those who have been wanting to try out this MMORPG but don't want to spend any money on it will be able to get it completely free on Steam right now as a limited-time gift for the holiday season. This comes during the Steam Winter Sale, which runs through January 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="FESTA: A Decade of Adventures 2024 | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlI-kQ6MCew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, as there will be an influx of new players thanks to the game being given away for free, they have boosted progression for those who are just joining. This comes with a 1000% combat EXP boost, which will fast-track progression for those who are on Season Servers. Players will also be able to get Graduation Rewards. These are special materials that players can obtain, which will allow them to craft Ornette's and Odore's Spirit Essence, as well as PEN Boss gear as a reward for completing the latest season.</p>
<p>There are plenty of updates that have been made to Black Desert, including a new mount that has been added to the game, and will be released on January 16, 2025. Black Desert Mobile specifically will also be receiving some major updates, with new content being added to the game in 2025. This includes Awakened Dawnveil Gear, a PvPvE battleground, and Atoraxxion: Vahmalkea, the first zone of Atoraxxion.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance will be improved over the open beta, as the game will deliver a better experience than the test version with the same hardware configuration.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Launch Community Update stream</a>, director Yuya Tokuda confirmed that, while the team cannot provide specifics yet regarding PC performance, PC performance will definitely be improved over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta test</a>, so players should expect a better experience on the same hardware as in the test version.</p>
<p>During the stream, it was also confirmed that Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a PlayStation 5 Pro day-one patch that will offer some yet-to-be-detailed improvements over the base model. In addition, it was also confirmed that on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Prioritize Graphics mode will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 3072x1728 resolution and 30 FPS. The Prioritize Framerate mode, on the other hand, will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 1080p and 60 FPS. On Xbox Series X, Monster Hunter Wilds will feature a single display mode that will target 1080p resolution and 30 FPS gameplay. In all cases, AMD FSR will be used to upscale the rendering resolution to the output resolution and not checkerboard rendering as in the open beta version.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Pre-Launch Community Update also goes over plenty of other changes coming to the final version of the game over the test version, such as weapon-specific changes, the return of hitstop, and more. You can check out the entire stream below.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1870106910751703303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">end-of-year message</a> on social media platform X, GSC Game World pledges to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year. As a reminder, the company recently released a major patch for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">features over 1800 fixes</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio promises to share the&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap at the start of 2025, although it doesn't commit to a specific date. It's likely we'll get to see what GSC Game World has planned for its latest game sometime in January or February at the very latest.</p>

Though the update was promised for Xbox Series X|S, it seems to be coming to PS5 as well, if GSC Game World's message is anything to go by.</p>

<p>They'll include "additional graphical enhancements and other features", as well as mod support, although the latter may be a while away yet.</p>

However, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s isn’t quite as self-explanatory as those in the first two movies if you’re not already familiar with the blue blur and all his friends (and enemies). The first two movies’ post-credits scenes felt like natural extensions of the movies they came from, but <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s is a bit more disorienting and might have left new fans a bit confused.

It starts with Sonic running around, seemingly racing against Tails and Knuckles as seen earlier in the movie. However, in his haste, the hedgehog takes a wrong turn or two and ends up in a New York state park. A bit far from your home in Green HIlls, Montana, my guy. Once there, he’s greeted by none other than Metal Sonic, an evil synthetic recreation of our hero who Doctor Eggman creates in the games to try and match Sonic’s speed and power. At first, Sonic outmaneuvers Metal as his attacker attempts to obliterate him with an energy blast from a cannon in his arm, but is then suddenly surrounded by a squad of his robotic doppelgangers. Just as they all jump in to take him out, they’re struck by a flying hammer covered in pink chaos energy similar to Sonic’s blue and Shadow’s red. It returns to its wielder: a hooded figure who reveals herself to be a pink hedgehog before the movie cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not one of the long-time fans who likely was popping off at this point in the theater, this hammer-using vigilante is Amy Rose. She originally debuted alongside Metal Sonic in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog CD </em>back in 1993. For most of her early appearances, Amy was defined as Sonic’s one-sided love interest—she was infatuated with the hero, but he was too busy being the fastest hedgehog alive to consider something as trivial as romance. However, as the years have gone on, Amy has become a much more well-rounded character and a team leader in her own right. Historically, she’s added some girlypop spunk to the <em>Sonic </em>cast, and after being a boys club for three movies, the live-action universe is in dire need of that.</p><p>But what are she and Metal Sonic doing in the live-action movies? Again, this scene feels pretty disconnected from the rest of the film, so there’s only so much we can pull from in this short exchange. Given that Sonic has traveled to a different part of the country than we’ve seen in the movies thus far, it’s entirely possible Amy has already been on Earth by herself for some time and decided to be a vigilante in New York. How she got here, where she comes from, and just how she’ll feel about more alien animals in her space remains to be seen, but seeing as <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>doubles down on the idea of Sonic and his kind being aliens from different places, it stands to reason that Amy is not from Earth, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bigger question mark in this scene is Metal Sonic. Eggman builds the robot hedgehog in the games, but as we saw not 10 minutes prior, Jim Carrey’s version of the mad scientist has seemingly kicked the bucket in a final moment of heroism. Granted, they also pretended to kill him off at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, but there were more explicit teases to his survival than anything in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Agent Stone, Eggman’s loyal henchman, has seemingly turned a new leaf at the end of the movie as well, so he’s probably off the table. In theory, anyone could have seen all the events of the first three movies and decided to create a robot version of Sonic, but there’s still the question of why. That’s the major difference between this post-credits scene and previous ones; this one feels almost abstract, introducing new ideas and characters who have no clear, direct connection to what happened in the movie it bookends. I wouldn’t be surprised if this scene is featured in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em>, maybe 10 to 15 minutes into the film with more context to fill in these gaps. But for now, the only thing we really know as a result of this scene is who the new players will be in the next film.</p><p>The second post-credits scene is much shorter and more straightforward. We see that one of Shadow’s inhibitor rings has made a small crater on Earth after it fell to the planet during the final battle in space. The shot lingers briefly before we see Shadow walk into the frame and pick it up. It’s not much, but it confirms that Shadow survived the destruction of the Eclipse Cannon and will be around for the next movie. That’s not too surprising. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is heavily based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, in which Shadow is presumed dead after the final battle, only to return in <em>Sonic Heroes</em> after being rescued by Eggman. There are reports of plans for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-centric spin-off</a></span>, too, so of course they didn’t kill him off for good.</p><p>Overall, I’m starting to wonder if <em>Sonic 4</em> could be a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Metal Sonic is the primary antagonist of that game, and if Shadow’s reported spin-off introduces the rest of his team, treasure-hunting spy Rouge the Bat and decommissioned Eggman robot E-123 Omega, they’re already halfway to having most of <em>Heroes</em>’ cast accounted for. Whatever the fourth movie ends up being, <em>Sonic </em>fans have a lot to chew on after the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>.

<p>Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has undergone a significant shake-up to its upper management team to hit its deadlines.</p>



<p>Speaking to sources who wish to stay anonymous as they cannot publically talk about the company’s plans, several top-level executives have been laid off, and other top people at the company have been shifted to different roles.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the changes were starting to be implemented earlier this month, with head honcho Christ Roberts announcing the news to staff in an internal memo following the company’s annual “<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Letter from the Chairman</a>” yesterday. In late November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games also let go of some of its staff</a>, prominently those in the QA department, as a part of its restructuring efforts.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Insider Gaming has heard of at least three executives with a combined experience of around 25 years at Cloud Imperium Games who have had their positions terminated. It’s said that announcements of their departures will be announced in due time.</p>



<p>In an internal announcement to employees, Chris Roberts said, To achieve this laser focus [of meeting the release of SQ42 and Star Citizen 1.0], it is more important than ever to ensure we have high-performing and efficient teams working throughout the company. In order to achieve this, I have had to make changes to the structure of our teams from the very top of the company and downwards to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, working in person as much as possible from our most critical year yet.”</p>



<p>Speaking with staff, some believe that the change is to save costs rather than to meet deadlines, with rumors around the office even suggesting that Sandi Gardiner, the wife of Chris Roberts, is to return to the company in a more prominent role. Sandi Gardiner left Cloud Imperium Games in May 2019 but remained on the board of directors.</p>



<p>Several months ago, Insider Gaming released an exclusive report on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what exactly is happening with Star Citizen’s 12 years of development</a>.</p>

<p>After appearing in the original season, the Renegade Raider, the rarest skin, has made its way back to the Fortnite Item Shop. The skin costs 1,200 V-Bucks, but you must unlock it before purchasing it. The OG Season Shop now consists of 4 new cosmetics: the Aerial Assault One Glider, the Aerial Assault Trooper Skin, Renegade Raider Skin and Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe; each of them has to be unlocked by collecting a specific amount of XP before being able to purchase them.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerial Assault One Glider – 500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 500,000 XP)</li>
