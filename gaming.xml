		<p>Krafton’s top-down tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg-blindspot">PUBG: Blindspot</a> is out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam Early Access</a>, and it’s a free-to-play game that’s worth checking out for fans of this kind of genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5qFiL2pdWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PUBG: Blindspot might share the branding of the hit battle royale, but it’s a totally different style of game. This is a 5v5 team shooter that’s all about lines of sight with a shared team vision, controlling angles and close quarters combat with an element of destruction. New content is already planned, including the defence character Blaze, the addition of Molotov Cocktails for area control.</p>
<p>The early access launch is the start of open development that will take on feedback from the player base to inform the updates, balance and future updates. It’s available for free at this time, and per the FAQ on Steam, it’s planned to stay in early access for around one year, after which Krafton “plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items.”&nbsp;The game will almost immediately kick into a seasonal structure, with Competitive Season 1 launching on 12th February.</p>
<p>“Early Access allows players to become active participants in the development process,” said Seungmyeong Yang, Production Director of PUBG: BLINDSPOT. “By launching as a free-to-play title and developing openly with the community, we aim to shape PUBG: BLINDSPOT together through ongoing communication and frequent updates.”</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this game late in 2024 saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>

<p>Following its release on Switch and Switch 2 last December</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="15948a6745072"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15948a6745072/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There was some shock earlier this week when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/heres-a-look-at-the-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-games-so-far">Nintendo's financials</a> seemingly confirmed that neither the Switch or Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> had cracked one million sales. So, how about the combined figures?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File journalist Stephen Totilo</a> has now reached out to Nintendo and got an official confirmation that the "combined sales" of the two titles have surpassed the one million mark. Here's the message relayed on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following some consternation yesterday about neither the Switch nor Switch 2 versions of Metroid Prime 4 (Dec. 4) making Nintendo's million-seller list for the period ending Dec 31, a Nintendo rep confirmed to me today that the combined sales of those 2 versions have in fact passed a million copies"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cehmswzr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Nintendo hasn't released the exact sales figures for either version, or the combined figures in this case, but this latest update likely puts these sales more in line with the typical performance of the Prime series, even if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-sales-have-got-off-to-a-slow-start">individual releases got off to a slow start</a>.</p>
<p>The side-scroller entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, which released on the Switch in 2021, is currently the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> series' best-selling game, with over three million sales. As for how Beyond stacks up against <em>other</em> Prime releases, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> game remains the most successful entry, and the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Remaster</a> on the Switch was able to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230509_4e.pdf">surpass the million mark</a> in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not known if Beyond has actually met Nintendo's sales expectations at this early stage, and there are many other factors to consider, including the title's lengthy development cycle, its cross-generation release, and a launch window in one of the busiest years on record for Nintendo - with the Switch 2 just getting started.</p>

<p>The Sony PlayStation 5 can officially claim victory over the Nintendo Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>



<p>Sony recently released its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 FY2025 earnings.</a> The data show that 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>units were sold in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the same quarter, Nintendo sold 7.01 million Switch 2 units. Of note, this was the first full quarter with the Nintendo Switch successor on the market.</p>



<p>The Sony PS5 has been on the market since 2020 and has sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-passes-90-million-units-sold/" id="174295"> over 90 million units </a>to date. The<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2 </a>was released in June 2025 and had <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold 17.37 million units </a>as of New Year’s Eve 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-battle-between-sony-and-nintendo-rages-on">The Battle Between Sony and Nintendo Rages on</h2>



<p>Although Sony had a stronger quarter, the Switch 2 outsold the PS5 in the United States in 2025. Nintendo’s original Switch is currently the second-best-selling console of all time, with 155.37 million units sold. However, Sony’s PS2 remains the best-selling console a quarter of a century after its release, with 160 million units sold worldwide.</p>







<p>Sony’s PlayStation 6 may not be released until 2027, giving Nintendo a head start in this generation. Learn more about the potential release of a PS6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" id="151319">here</a>. Even Xbox, which acts more as a publisher in today’s console market, may not have its next<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" id="94492"> hardware release until 2027.</a></p>

<p>Sony has reached another milestone in PlayStation 5 sales.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to its latest financial report,</a> Sony sold 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>consoles in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. As of September 30, Sony was boasting more than 84.1 million sales. This means that, based on the new data, more than 90 million PS5 consoles have been sold.</p>



<p>Despite this milestone, PS5 sales remain down 1.5 million year over year, with 9.5 million consoles sold in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024.</p>











<p>New data also reveal that combined PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 software sales totaled 97.2 million units. According to Sony, this total covers all PS4 and PS5 titles, including those bundled with PlayStation consoles and PlayStation VR.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are 132 million active users on the PlayStation Network as of the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. This number is slightly up from 129 million in the same quarter of the previous year.</p>







<p>While Sony had a strong 2025, Nintendo still led the United States in hardware sales for the year with its Nintendo Switch 2 console.

<p>The Heavy, Max and the rest of the gang are back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ahead of the Nintendo Partner Direct Showcase today, developer Skunkape Games (the team founded by former Telltale employees who revived the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sam_and_max_the_complete_trilogy">Sam &amp; Max</a> series) has announced the return of <strong>Poker Night at the Inventory</strong>.</p>
<p>This poker title featuring an all-star cast of video game characters was originally developed by Telltale Games and released on Steam in 2010. The new version has been "lovingly remastered" and will be reopening its doors for Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently reopened following a seismic retrofit, the Inventory is once again the hottest gathering place for video game characters to unwind after a long day on the job. Drop in to play No Limit Texas Hold’em with four familiar faces: Max, Strong Bad, Tycho, and The Heavy.</p>
<p>From the archives of Telltale Games, this jokey poker game pits iconic characters against the Player (that’s you!) in a high-stakes battle of cards, bets, and trash talk.</p>
<p>Each tournament you win brings you closer to unlocking a new hidden table design or custom card deck, each with new art unique to one of your opponent’s home franchises. Some of the decks and table felts have hidden properties that change the look of a character at the table, or the game itself. Keep an eye out for new unlocks created just for this release.</p>
<p>The Inventory and its guests look better than ever, with a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to tuning how much table talk you want to hear, you can now change the starting buy-in amount to literally raise or lower the stakes. There are also some new graphics features to up the filmic ambiance, like optional cinematic motion blur and film grain (they're off by default).</p>
<p>The team stripped Poker Night’s original poker code down to parts, scraped the gunk away, and rebuilt it better than new. Poker Night at the Inventory now plays a far more accurate game of poker, and your opponents will make more informed decisions that better fit their play style and personality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Says Its New Console Plays The ‘Majority’ Of Steam Games At 4K 60FPS With FSR]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-resolution-framerate-specs-2000665807</link>
            <guid>1426090</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve still hasn’t revealed the full breakdown of what’s inside its new Steam Machine console or how much it will cost. Those details were delayed along <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">with the device’s “early” 2026 launch</a> due to an AI-fueled PC part shortage. But the company did offer a fresh clue about how the mini-computer will perform, and it almost sounds too good to be true.</p> <p>“In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS with FSR on Steam Machine,” the company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">wrote in a new update</a> on February 4. “That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution. In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.”</p>

 <p>Steam users are…skeptical. “I don’t see how that’s possible on many, if not most current AAA games,” wrote one commenter. “The hardware just isn’t there. Isn’t this supposed to be a 3050 or lower class device?” Another wrote, “I don’t think the hardware is capable of delivering this promise. I have a 12 GB 3060. Which, presumably, is a significantly more powerful GPU than the one being offered. But it’s a still a lower-end GPU and I’m not playing any AAA games at 4K.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">It’s hard to know what exactly that means</a> since thousands of new games come to Steam every year and most of them are small indie games that aren’t very demanding to run. The Steam Machine might run <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> at 4K 60FPS no problem, but what about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Crimson Desert</em>, both AAA blockbusters coming to Valve’s storefront over the next couple of months? Not to mention all of the games that launched last year with PC performance issues like<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p>

 <p>If the Steam Machine can pull off 4K 60FPS for even some of those big games without too much frame generation or upscaling, it would have a lot to offer not just console players but people coming from lower-end or very dated PC gaming rigs. But it also probably won’t come cheap. Then again, in this new world where gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">gets more expensive every year</a>, who’s to say what even still counts as “cheap.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802</link>
            <guid>1426081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a>, Valve’s ambitious new venture into living room console gaming, was supposed to begin shipping in “early” 2026. That’s no longer the case. The company announced on Wednesday that its original launch plans have been pushed back to later in the year due to memory and storage shortages as companies race to pivot to AI.</p> <p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">February 4 blog post</a>. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p>

 <p>The plan is still to ship the Steam Machine, a new Steam controller, and the new Steam Frame VR headset within the first half of 2026. That suggests the first units should still arrive in players’ hands sometime before June 30. But Valve adds that market conditions are currently shifting too quickly to confirm “concrete pricing and launch dates” at the start of 2026 as previously planned.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">First revealed back in November</a>, the Steam Machine is a small cube-shaped console with PC gaming specs somewhere between a PlayStation 5 and a PS5 Pro. The device is targeting the most common specs of the average Steam user with the goal of playing most games at 4K 60FPS with FSR enabled. This has led to lots of speculation about how much the device might actually cost, with Valve confirming it’s not planning to sell Steam Machines at a loss and declining to say whether it will be close to the current average console price of $500.</p>

 <p>And that was before PC components from RAM to graphics cards started significantly increasing in price as part supplies are monopolized by companies investing in AI datacenters. Employees at retailers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">GameStop and Target</a> have showed SSDs for PS5s and other upgrades spiking in price overnight, and some companies have shifted out of the consumer market altogether. While Valve seems to be waiting to see if things calm down at all, there’s no indication yet that this isn’t just the new normal.</p>

But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.”</p><p>When <em>The Verge</em> and other outlets met with Valve to preview the new hardware, the company remained mostly vague about pricing at the time — one of the most important questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">if these devices would compete with game consoles rather than PCs</a>. From the beginning, Valve told us the Steam Machine, its ambitious new console, would be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space.” For the Frame, the company said it was aiming for a price that was less than its previous headset, the Index, which cost $999. And for the Steam Controller, Valve said it was targeting a price that would be competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs.”</p><p>But within days of Valve’s hardware announcements last November, it became clear that Valve would have a tough time offering competitive pricing with the cost of RAM shooting up. It <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/valve-brings-back-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-hands-on-with-valves-new-amd-based-living-room-gaming-hardware">told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a> that the console was tough to price because “the market is kind of weird” and “memory prices are going up like right as we speak.” As of early 2026, PC gamers have seen the price of RAM triple, even quadruple, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">memory makers pour their supply</a> into the more profitable AI server realm.</p><p>Yesterday, AMD CEO Lisa Su <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2026%2F02%2F03%2Famd-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript%2F" rel="sponsored">said on an earnings call</a> that “From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” It seems that the words “from a product standpoint” were carrying a lot more weight than we thought.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874196/valve-steam-machine-frame-controller-delay-pricing-memory-crisis]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" id="172462">Valve </a>provides an update on the release of its Steam Machine and additional hardware slated for 2026.</p>



<p>Valve is once again entering the console market with its PC-console hybrid, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam-machine/" id="3197">Steam Machine</a>. Announced in November 2025, the new console is slated for release in the first half of 2026. Now, Valve has provided an update on its Hardware releases, some of the challenges they’re facing, and what that means for customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-and-launch-date-remain-uncertain-for-steam-machine">Pricing and Launch Date Remain Uncertain for Steam Machine</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post </a>on Wednesday, February 4, Valve revealed that industry-wide memory and storage shortages and rising memory prices have forced it to revisit its shipping schedule and pricing, particularly for the Steam Machine and the Steam Frame VR headset.</p>



<p>They still plan to ship all three products in the first half of the year, but they are currently working to finalize pricing and a specific launch date. They promise to keep customers updated as best they can.</p>



<p>“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce,” they say.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-steam-machine-s-ssd-and-memory-will-be-upgradable">The Steam Machine’s SSD and Memory Will Be Upgradable</h2>



<p>Later in the blog, there’s an FAQ. There, Valve reveals the components of the Steam Machine and notes that both the SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) will be upgradable. They also claim that during test runs, most Steam titles run at 4K 60FPS with FSR on the Steam Machine.</p>



<p>However, they note that some titles will require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower frame rate. They’re also working on HDMI VRR and investigating how to improve upscaling and optimize ray tracing performance.</p>







<p>While it’s not fair to say these devices are being delayed, as no concrete release date was ever given, the uncertainties players hoped would be resolved by now will continue due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/">volatility of the RAM market</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>explains its belief that updates to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 3 help maintain player loyalty during the Switch-to-Switch 2 transition.</p>



<p>In January 2026, Nintendo launched a significant update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" id="3155">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. This update not only introduced additional in-game content but also quality-of-life improvements for those who pick up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a> edition of the game. Splatoon 3 also received a major update, extending its lifecycle. Splatoon also received specific updates to support the next Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Now, Nintendo is admitting that it is trying to balance releasing new titles for its latest console with easing players into the transition from the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-president-discusses-transition-philosophy">Nintendo President Discusses Transition Philosophy</h2>



<p>During its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor presentation</a>, Shuntaro Furukawa, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd., explained that major updates to existing titles are a key part of Nintendo’s philosophy because they help maintain connections with existing customers.</p>



<p>The belief is that it allows players to feel they are still getting value from their original Nintendo Switch while creating a pathway to adopt the next-generation console.</p>



<p>“As we move forward with the multi-year transition from Switch to Switch 2, we believe it is also very important to maintain contact with our customers who are currently using Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>“In that sense, we thot it would be a good idea to update titles that have been big sellers on the Switch, such as ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ and ‘Splatoon 3,’ at this time,” he said (via Google Translate).</p>







<p>Nintendo is continuing to march into its next generation. However, they are not fully finished with the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, scheduled for February 5, will feature games coming to both consoles. Insider Gaming will have coverage of the presentation.</p>

Today’s update comes in the form of a FAQ addressing some of the other most-asked-about topics surrounding the new hardware.</p><p>Here is the full FAQ:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Steam Frame and VR</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Will Steam Frame support other streaming services?</strong></p><p>SteamOS has a built-in browser, and we expect streaming services to work in a theatrical browser mode.</p><p><strong>How can I request a Steam Frame developer kit?</strong></p><p>Steamworks developers can submit a request for Steam Frame dev kits at the partner site <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Supplies are limited, but we are sending out kits on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Will Steam Frame work with lighthouse base stations?</strong></p><p>It’s not something we’re working on, but we built Steam Frame to be modular and extensible so that the community and 3rd parties can build out the features and accessories that are important to them.</p><p><strong>Can Steam Frame be used while wearing glasses?</strong></p><p>A bunch of people on the team wear glasses and use Steam Frame without issue, but it really depends on the width of the glasses frames. And while we don’t have details to share yet, we are looking into making prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</p><p>I heard that Steam Frame has foveated streaming – is that the same thing as foveated rendering? What games support it?<br>With Steam Frame, we are introducing a new feature called foveated streaming. While both use eye tracking data, the technology is different:</p><ul><li>Foveated rendering uses eye tracking data so the game only renders high resolution data in the portion of the viewport that the player is looking at.</li><li>Foveated streaming, on the other hand, uses eye tracking data so that the <a title="Platforms > PC [25,417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> only streams high resolution data in the portion of the viewport the player is looking at.</li></ul><p>Since foveated streaming is a system-level feature, it applies to all games, and requires no game developer work. If a game implements foveated rendering, the benefits of that feature will stack with foveated streaming.</p><p><strong>Will Valve Index have ongoing product support?</strong></p><p>While we’re no longer making Valve Index, we do intend to support Index owners the same way we have in the past on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Machine</strong></p><p><strong>How well can Steam Machine play newer, more demanding games on Steam?</strong></p><p>In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K resolution / 60 frames per second with FSR on Steam Machine. That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.</p><p>In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.</p><p><strong>Will third parties be able to make faceplates for Steam Machine? Will you be making the CAD for those faceplates available?</strong></p><p>Yes, we plan to share faceplate CAD, specs, and details in the coming months, for customers and manufacturers to make their own.</p><p><strong>What components of Steam Machine are upgradeable?</strong></p><p>Steam Machine’s SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both accessible and upgradeable.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Controller</strong></p><p><strong>Can I play non steam games with the Steam Controller?</strong></p><p>he controller can work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller-update-we-have-work-to-do-to-land-on-concrete-pricing-and-launch-dates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For those concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" id="155026">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> failed to sell 1 million copies, there is some good news.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>released its financial results for the end of 2025, many noted that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was not among the games reported to have sold over a million copies. The game was released in December for both the original Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, leading to some being concerned that a major Nintendo release failed to meet these benchmarks. </p>



<p>However, Nintendo has confirmed that the game has surpassed 1 million sales across both the original and successor Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>







<p>Stephen Totilo on Bluesky said a Nintendo representative told him the combined sales surpassed the metric.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-was-the-final-game-for-nintendo-dev">Metroid Prime 4 Was the Final Game for Nintendo Dev</h2>



<p>In the wake of the release of Metroid Prime 4, Kensuke Tanabe, a legendary producer at Nintendo known for his work on the franchise,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-will-be-kensuke-tanabes-final-nintendo-project/" id="171810"> confirmed</a> that this would be the final game that he would work on at Nintendo.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017 and took nearly a decade to release, after the project switched development Studios from Bandai Namco to Retro Studios. Ultimately, the game received favorable reviews, but many admitted it failed to live up to the legacy of earlier games in the franchise.</p>







<p>Nintendo continues to march into the future with a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, announcing more games coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 and some that will release on the original Nintendo Switch. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the presentation on February 5.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, a reliable leaker has shared news about a potential massive 2024 title coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Nate the Hate claimed on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8B7axb3JMY&amp;list=TLPQMDQwMjIwMjb__a7baZGy0Q&amp;index=2&amp;pp=iAQB0gcJCZEKAYcqIYzvsAgC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> discussing the forthcoming Direct that he has heard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-myth-wukong/" id="868">Black Myth: Wukong</a> will be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2. He could not confirm whether the game would be showcased in the February Nintendo Direct, but he remains confident it will arrive on Nintendo’s latest home console.</p>



<p>The game sold tens of millions of copies early in its lifecycle and was named best action game at the 2024 Game Awards.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>may be dropping the “2” from its name, but it’s trading it in for the Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Details remain scarce, but the development team announced that Overwatch is heading to the Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026. The announcement was made during the Overwatch Spotlight on Thursday, February 4, 2026. The game was released on the original Nintendo Switch. As such, it is playable on the successor console. However, a dedicated Switch 2 release would mean some likely upgrades and optimization for the new hardware.</p>



<p>As of yet, there is no specific release date attached to the release of Overwatch: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-news-from-the-overwatch-spotlight">More News From the Overwatch Spotlight</h2>



<p>The big announcement from the showcase was the reveal of a year-long story arc known as “The Reign of Talon.” Reign of Talon will be a 6-season storyline, introducing five new heroes, new in-game events, and more. A new arc will then commence in early 2027.</p>



<p>Also, it was announced that Overwatch, which had renamed itself “Overwatch 2” in 2022, will revert to its original name. Players can learn more about that mindset behind that decision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-to-be-renamed-overwatch-with-next-update/" id="174168">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-with-new-story-focus-and-new-characters-including-a-flying-cat-healer/</link>
            <guid>1425955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard is hitting the big red reset button on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, reverting the game back to being just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a> from 10th February, a bit like when Prince decided to be called Prince again instead of having an unpronounceable sign for a name. As part of the soft reboot, Overwatch will embrace a new story focus with a narrative arc running through each season, and there will be 10 new heroes launched through the year, with the first five joining the roster alongside the reboot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overwatch Animated Short | “Reign of Talon”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ch2J2Xuu3VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Overwatch might have been feeling some of the heat from Marvel Rivals, pushing Blizzard to take this reinvigorated approach, harking back to the early days of the game. Each arc will start with a new cinematic and then continue through motion comics, in-game events, new voice lines, animated hero trailers and short stories.</p>
<p>The five new heroes include&nbsp;Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat, and each one will have an important role in the story.</p>


<p>Joining the Talon forces, with Vendetta leading them, is Domina, taking on the role of being a poke tank with a hard-light barrier, sonic repulsors and an imprisoning barrier ultimate. Emre is a former Overwatch Strike Team member, but walked away, got some cybernetic mods, and kind of lost his mind – he’s a fact-paced run-and-gun damage style. Mizuki is a new support with spinning blades that bounce of walls, a healing hat to bounce around and a healing sanctuary.</p>
<p>On the Overwatch side of things is the new damage dealer Anran, who shoots fiery projectiles and is sure to be veeeeeeerrry popular for cosmetics – hence why she’s available from 5th Feb via a Hero Trial. Then there’s Jetpack Cat, who is a ginger cat riding a jetpack and meowing a lot. She has Biotic Pawjectiles, a healling Purr, and the abilitiy to catnap as her ultimate. She will also make pet owners feel very, very guilty for shooting at her.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | 5 New Heroes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fa9myF4xm8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The three main character classes will remain, but they’re now being broken down into sub-roles to give special buffs as follows:</p>
<p>TANK</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRUISER</strong>: Reduces critical damage received. While at critical health, gain movement speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Mauga / Orisa / Roadhog / Zarya</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>INITIATOR</strong>: Staying airborne lightly heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>D.Va / Doomfist / Winston / Wrecking Ball</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>STALWART</strong>: Reduces knockbacks and slows received.
<ul>
<li><em>Domina / Hazard / Junker Queen / Ramattra / Reinhardt / Sigma</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DAMAGE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHARPSHOOTER</strong>: Critical hits reduce your movement ability cooldowns.
<ul>
<li><em>Ashe / Cassidy / Hanzo / Sojourn / Widowmaker</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FLANKER</strong>: Health packs restore more health.
<ul>
<li><em>Anran / Genji / Reaper / Tracer / Vendetta / Venture</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SPECIALIST</strong>: Eliminating an enemy briefly increases your reload speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Bastion / Emre / Junkrat / Mei / Soldier: 76 / Symmetra / Torbjorn</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RECON</strong>: You detect enemies below half health through walls after damaging them.
<ul>
<li><em>Echo / Freja / Pharah / Sombra</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUPPORT</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TACTICIAN</strong>: You can gain excess ultimate charge, which carries over after using your ultimate ability.
<ul>
<li><em>Ana / Baptiste / Jetpack Cat / Lucio / Zenyatta</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>MEDIC</strong>: Healing allies with your weapon also heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>Kiriko / Lifeweaver / Mercy / Moira</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SURVIVOR</strong>: Using a movement ability activates passive health regeneration.
<ul>
<li><em>Brigitte / Illari / Juno / Mizuki / Wuyang</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | Sub-Roles &amp; New Meta Event" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRaSIHEJ424?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Season 1 will kick off a new meta event that will run for five weeks, asking players to join either Talon or Overwatch, and then fight for their side. You’ll get missions to complete each week to further the lore of the battle, and earn tons of lootboxes along the way.</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s an ugly new main menu that looks like a mobile F2P game. The old menus weren’t perfect, but they had a pleasing minimalism and clarity to them.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/873755/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-impressions</link>
            <guid>1425952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the Virtual Boy was both a commercial and critical failure, the console’s infamy is part of what has made it such a fascinating piece of Nintendo’s history. Original units are still going for hundreds of dollars on bidding sites, and hobbyists have spent years keeping the Virtual Boy alive through emulation and homebrew games. For a long while, it seemed like Nintendo wanted nothing more than for the public to forget that the Virtual Boy ever existed. But over time, the company has become more comfortable acknowledging and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQ">joking about the system through references</a> in games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, <em>Tomodachi Life</em>, and <a href="https://luigi-mansion.fandom.com/wiki/Virtual_Boo"><em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em></a>.</p><p>Looking back on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357848/nintendo-3ds-switch-upgrade">Nintendo 3DS</a> and more recent experiments like the Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQ">Labo</a>, it wasn’t exactly surprising to learn that the Virtual Boy was being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777032/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-games">resurrected as a Switch peripheral</a> designed to be used while playing classic Virtual Boy games on Nintendo Switch Online. There’s a nifty poetry to Nintendo’s worst-selling console being reimagined as a fancy peripheral for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console">most successful system of all time</a>. Everything about the new Virtual Boy’s release speaks to Nintendo being confident enough to revisit one of its biggest failures and turn it into a flex that is quite literally designed to prop up the Switch family of consoles.</p><p>When I recently spent some time playing with the new Virtual Boy, though, Nintendo’s confidence in this $100 side quest didn’t feel entirely justified. The headset / stand combo is a gorgeous piece of retro tech that’s comfortable enough to shove your face into. And even though I was kind of hoping to experience some disorienting visual weirdness, the console’s stereoscopic lenses didn’t leave me with a headache. But there’s a clunkiness to the way the Virtual Boy’s games played that made the device feel more like an aged novelty rather than a system I could see myself spending some serious time with.</p><p>The major selling point to this thing is that it’s faithfully re-creating aspects of the original console that worked while smoothing over some of the roughness that led to it flopping in the ’90s. But if retro nostalgia isn’t really your jam, you might want to pass on the plastic model and consider <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873745/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-labo-cardboard-vr">dusting off your old Labo kit</a>.</p><p>As someone who never played the original Virtual Boy and tends to find VR headsets uncomfortable to wear, I was pleasantly surprised at how well my face fit into the new peripheral, which is meant to stand on a table and be used with a controller after you insert your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it. Unlike my cardboard Labo headset — which was prone to letting external light leak in — the plastic Virtual Boy was able to plunge me into total darkness while I was sitting in a well-lit event space.</p><p>That darkness made the redness — which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">can be customized to other colors</a> — of the Virtual Boy’s monochromatic game selection screen pop as I browsed through the limited library of 3D titles. Nintendo says that by the end of this year, it plans to release 14 different Virtual Boy games through its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> subscription package, which costs $50 a year for individual accounts and $80 for family plans. The first batch of Virtual Boy games is due out on February 17th when the $100 peripheral and its cheaper $25 cardboard counterpart are being released.</p><p>During my time with the Virtual Boy, I found myself charmed but a little underwhelmed while playing games like <em>Galactic Pinball</em>, <em>Teleroboxer</em>, and a new port of <em>The Mansion of Innsmouth</em> — a title that had previously only been released in Japan. The games ran perfectly fine and looked like what you would expect from a point in Nintendo’s history when it was experimenting with a new way to make its games feel immersive. As impressive as this lens technology might have been when the original Virtual Boy was released, it pales in comparison to what Nintendo managed to accomplish with the 3DS, and it never managed to fully trick my eyes into thinking that I was playing a game in 3D.</p><p>Ironically, it was more aesthetically simplistic games with vector graphics like <em>3-D Tetris</em> and <em>Red Alarm </em>that felt like they were really pulling me in with their novel approach to presenting three-dimensional space. There’s also something to be said for the fact that playing these games in any form has become much more difficult over the years. This new peripheral might not exactly set off a new wave of Virtual Boy game preservation, but it will make them infinitely more accessible — especially for folks who weren’t around during the original console’s brief lifespan.</p><p>Though Nintendo didn’t give me hands-on time with the cardboard Virtual Boy, I came away much more interested in trying that out and seeing what these games might look like on a Labo. The plastic model definitely looks cool and will probably scratch a certain itch for those who wish they’d been able to own a Virtual Boy back in the ’90s. But in 2026, these kinds of 3D games just feel a bit <em>too </em>dated to warrant the price of admission if you aren’t already paying for an NSO subscription.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/873755/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-impressions]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1425949</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon </a>will include a ranked mode, and a new report provides the first look into its details.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie </a>has not officially confirmed many details about the upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. However, new details have been shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marathon-ranked-mode-surface-scoring-holotags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/2019105753978794502?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X0X_Leak.</a></p>



<p>The ranked mode in the upcoming game will have 6 tiers, with discussion of a 7th “Master” tier. The 6 tiers mentioned in the report are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Pinnacle. Each tier has three individual sub-rankings as players level up. Ranked rewards will include cosmetics and other items, some of which players will be able to equip directly, and others will be gifted to them after a season is over.</p>







<h2 id="h-scoring-details-for-marathon-ranked-mode">Scoring Details for Marathon Ranked Mode</h2>



<p>The report goes on to mention scoring details, noting that players must have a Holotag equipped to score in a match. There is no Holotag equipped; there will be no contribution to the score. If players successfully exfil from a ranked match before reaching the target score, no rank progress is gained or lost. Failing to exfil results in a point loss equal to the full Score target.</p>



<p>Holotags have rarities equivalent to the ranks mentioned above. Each tag has unique effects that boost score targets when looted from other Runners during a match, also enabling potential scores higher than the initial target.</p>



<p>For example, a Silver Holotag grants players 5,000 credits to their score target on Infil, and any additional looted silver tags expand players’ credit capacities by 1,000.</p>

It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p><p>Do anything and everything. <em>Caves of Qud</em> is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [934 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [18,003 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,851 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Rlease Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Release Date Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DisUBYdcFcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/caves-of-qud-for-switch-launches-february-16]]></content:encoded>

      <p>As you may have seen, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>there was some big <em>Overwatch </em>news today</u></a>, including the reveal of a bunch of new characters and <em>Overwatch 2</em> dropping the "2" from its title.</p><p>What you might not have seen was that IGN accidentally leaked a bunch of that news by accidentally publishing a story early,<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq/"> <u>ahead of its agreed embargo time</u></a>. It's catastrophic for marketing teams when that happens, so I understand they'd be pretty annoyed, but it also happens sometimes, because games writers are human and humans make mistakes. This isn't the first time an embargo has accidentally been broken, and it won't be the last.</p><p>As annoyed as the <em>Overwatch </em>team would have been, though, was this tweet (below) from an account with 3.3 million followers (who knows how many are real or left these days, though) really necessary? Calling out the publication by name--a name that acts as a flame to every shit-brained moth still using Twitter and frothing at the mouth over video game <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-anime-review-score-discourse/"><u>review</u></a> scores--is not a great look for <em>Overwatch's</em> social team, but throwing in a slogan from an authoritarian regime for good measure makes it much, much worse.</p><figure></figure><p>It should be noted that as part of the big announcements today the <em>Overwatch </em>Twitter account says it has been taken over by Talon, the game's villains, so this could have been an attempt at an in-universe joke that didn't even land at all, let alone land badly. But only a few other posts have tried to be "in-character", and they were all just harmless cartoon villain stuff, not...using a Trump slogan to call out a website that gamers on the platform owned by a white supremacist love to hate.</p><p>I get it, spoiling a big day of news must have sucked! But there are more productive ways of dealing with that than punching down at someone who made a mistake.</p>
