<p>For reel</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> was first announced for Switch earlier this summer, we've been eager to find out how the award-winning photo puzzle game would hold up on the Nintendo hybrid. Well, today we learned that we don't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Thunderful and Sad Owl Games have announced that Viewfinder will arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>3rd December</strong>, slotting itself into the same week as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and every other game under the sun, it seems.</p>
<p>What's worse, we're very excited to play this one too. Viewfinder sees you adventuring through a trippy land, using photos from your magical camera to alter perspectives and bend the laws of physics.</p>
<p>You want to cross a bridge? Take a photo of a bridge and line it up with your surroundings. You want to bypass a fence? Take a picture of an open space and step through it. It's the kind of gameplay that's difficult to visualise until you see it in action, but the above trailer provides a pretty comprehensive introduction.</p>
<p>Here's a brief game summary and a handful of screens from Thunderful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Viewfinder, you take photos, find paintings and sketches, then place them in the world to have them become a fabric of its reality, reshaping the environment around you. This unique mechanic delights in the way it plays with perception, evolving in surprising directions that keep players challenged with every new puzzle they encounter.</p>
<p>Along with the game’s engaging puzzles, Viewfinder welcomes you into a vibrant landscape with mysterious origins. Uncover the game’s secrets to find yourself unravelling a story that connects to our ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change, and overcoming loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Viewfinder picked up award nominations and wins at the BAFTAs, The Game Awards, The Golden Joysticks and more after its release back in 2023, so we're very excited to hear that we won't have long to wait before we finally get our hands on it.</p>
<p>Bring on a busy December!</p>

If you miss the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as much as you do the mottled grass textures of Hyrule Field, you will perhaps enjoy Mouseward, which is available now in pre-alpha form. It's a "soulslike collectathon" from the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-sols">Void Sols</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/void-sols-is-an-atmospheric-and-highly-customisable-soulslike-for-people-who-are-rubbish-at-soulslikes">found to be</a> "an atmospheric and highly customisable Soulslike for people who are rubbish at Soulslikes". Mouseward seems similarly forgiving, for all its grim talk of death being "a lesson, not an end".

<p>
Yes, enemies respawn when you perish, but you get to keep all your accumulated progression points and spend them right away at the most recent campfire, care of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-style astral level-up menu. Yes, the world looks a bit like Anor Londo, nested at the bottom of a well of Erdtrees, but it also looks like one of those N64 games you played, decades before you were exposed to the hellish clockwork of "deliberate, stamina-based combat". The visuals are at once chubby and cadaverous, like a mix of Ocarina of Time and Medieval. Here's a trailer.

The premise is that a "calamitous starfall" has brought a kingdom to ruin. You are a rodent Chosen Undead, rising from your grave to mend the world by tracking down every last scattered piece of star. Along the way, there will be blocking, backstabbing, archers, ambushes, secret entrances, plunging attacks, and melancholy, murderous badgers. In precisely that order, in fact.</p><p>I've just finished the opening bonfire loop in the pre-alpha, and I soulslike this a lot. Simple, tight controls, good atmosphere, and the enticing sense of a developer taking a genre back to formula - and possibly taking it somewhere new, once the tutorial segments are past. I'm interested to discover how the Fromsoft template might have to shapeshift to accommodate the collectathon focus and nods to fifth generation console action-platformers. Anyway, <a href="https://finite-reflection.itch.io/mouseward">you can find that Mouseward pre-alpha on Itch.io</a>. The game also has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188410/Mouseward/">Steam page</a>.

              <p>The infrastructure of the modern social media landscape means that every so often someone clips out a section of a modern blockbuster that <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">uses bright yellow paint</a> to guide the player where to go and says something like, “This is why games suck now.”</p> <p>So it was with <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, whose prodigious use of yellow hues to tag climbing ledges and other footholds for progressing the adventure sparked minor controversy back during launch. Was it a lazy shortcut or clever game design? The game’s director has now weighed in on the subject.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE YELLOW PAINT VIRUS HAS INFECTED FF7 <a href="https://t.co/calN0dqHf4">pic.twitter.com/calN0dqHf4</a></p> <p>— Dave NewBlood (@DaveOshry) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveOshry/status/1755469586999505137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don’t,” Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a> in a recent interview. “I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game.”</p>

 <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed. So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it’s done, what level and what works. And there’ll still be people who say, “no, that doesn’t fit at all. We don’t like that.” That’s fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it’s something that is definitely worth looking at.</p></blockquote>   <p>“There’s definitely a need there” suggests Hamaguchi has seen enough people running around lost during playtesting to know that yellow paint, while far from the most elegant solution, is preferable to people getting stuck and frustrated. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is full of what one friend described as “bird poop” to mark its climbing ledges, and <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is even more gratuitously slathered in liquid caution tape than <em>Rebirth</em>. None of us&nbsp;<em>want</em> yellow paint until <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1764392813255410002">we absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em></a> yellow paint.</p> <p>Such is the push and pull over immersion in hyper-realistic open-world RPGs (or in the case of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, visually messy linear corridors) that sometimes the best way to keep you ensconced in the fantasy is to momentarily shatter it with non-diegetic signposting. Hamaguchi’s position on the subject won’t put an end to the debate; we’ll see if the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> game implements a different solution or our old friend the yellow paint monster returns.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst.1338352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The week is seven days long. <a href="https://youtu.be/kle2xHhRHg4">Don’t let The Beatles confuse you otherwise</a>. And if we were all just chilling in caves, eating bugs, and painting on the walls, the seven days wouldn’t matter. But that ain’t the world we live in. Instead, we have jobs and obligations. And that means the days that make up the week and its fun cousin, the weekend, are not all equal. Some days just suck, while others are so great we write songs about them.</p> <p>Anyway, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> decided it was time for someone to sit down and rank all seven days of the week. Finally, when pressured to provide an opinion on the concept of Thursday, you’ll have an answer you can use. Or when you ask ChatGPT about Thursday, it can scrape this post and provide our words to you. Whichever works, I guess. Let’s get to the ranking!</p>

 <h2>1. Saturday</h2> <p>Yeah, not a surprise, but Saturday is the best day of the week. For those of you who work a five-day week, Saturday is the crown jewel of the seven days. When you wake up Saturday, you are still feeling good from Friday, you don’t have to worry about your job, and you know that tomorrow is Sunday, another work-free day. Pure bliss. Nothing beats a perfect Saturday.</p>

 <h2>2. Friday</h2> <p>“Wait”! I hear you say. “Isn’t this a work day?” Yes, it is. But Fridays are both the end of the work week and the glorious start of the weekend. You have two days of doing nothing to look forward to, and one of those days is Saturday aka the best day. It’s hard not to feel excited and happy as Friday afternoon rolls around. It ain’t part of the weekend, but it’s still great.</p>

 <h2>3. Sunday</h2> <p>Sundays are strange. Sure, it follows Saturday, and that’s nice. And you don’t have to work, which is also nice. But Sundays are filled with dread. Your job is looming closer than ever. Monday is nearly here, and soon you’ll be back at your job. It seriously kills Sunday’s vibes. Still, the weekend is the weekend, so Sunday makes it into the top three.</p>

 <h2>4. Thursday</h2> <p>Oh, Thursday, you poor bastard. Doomed to forever be Friday-eve, you offer little more than the promise that soon things will get better. And that’s nice, but you are still another day of work sandwiched between more work. And that makes you a bit of a buzzkill. Sorry.</p>

 <h2>5. Wednesday</h2> <p>Wednesdays can often feel like the longest day of the week. You’re stuck in the middle of it all, two days removed from the fun of last weekend and 48 hours away from Saturday. This is the mountaintop of the week. From here, you can see all that came before and will come after, and while that provides a nice milestone, it’s also kind of a downer.</p>

 <h2>6. Monday</h2> <p>Many malign Mondays, often mocking the miserable start of the week. And make no mistake: Mondays suck. However, at least Monday follows the weekend directly. You’re still feeling good. Sure, the week is ahead of you, but the weekend is still a recent memory in your heart. It could be worse. It could be…</p> <h2>7. Tuesday</h2> <p>Fuck you, Tuesday. Sure, you are technically one step closer to the upcoming weekend than Monday, but that’s all this crappy day has to offer. There’s still so much week left and you’re already tired from Monday, a very bad day. Now you have to work more and you have three more days of this shit, too? Bleh. Gross. Horrible. Go to hell, Tuesday. That’s where you belong.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, the upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter from developer Embark Studios (<i>The Finals</i>) is out tomorrow. I recently had a chance to sit down with the game’s design director, Virgil Watkins, to chat about the brutal nature of extraction shooters, how <i>Arc Raiders</i> seeks to appeal to folks skeptical of the genre’s hardcore nature, and, of course, whether my playstyle is toxic.</p> <p>Below is the transcript of our discussion about <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ approach to making the extraction shooter more friendly without compromising its intensity.</p> <p><i>This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639881"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639881">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: So in <i>Arc Raiders</i> I can sprint, I can walk, I can dodge out of the way of incoming fire, I can swap the camera on my shoulder. But why can’t I lay down?</p>

 <p><b>Virgil Watkins, Design Director on </b><b><i>Arc Raiders</i></b>: Well, I mean, one, it is a massive animation hurdle to get that to behave correctly in all the states, and then two, just kind of the way the game is balanced and the pacing of it. Having people default to proning and hiding kind of disrupts that.</p>

But overall, it just didn’t feel like it fit with the game loop we’ve got.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Gotcha. Okay. So extraction shooters tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">appeal to a very specific crowd</a>. Are you guys content with a game that mostly appeals to a hardcore niche?</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: Once we pivoted to an extraction game, approachability became a key design tenet. Everything we have done up to this point tries to keep that in mind wherever possible, as long as it does not undermine that core extraction experience. We’ve put in a lot of systems that can act as a safety net or can soften the blow of failure. We have things like our quests, which many of them do not require you to extract.</p>

 <p>We have the safe pocket, which lets you put quest items that you might need in there and make incremental progress toward that goal. We have things in the meta game like our feats or trials which will come out with the launch of the game that, again, by progressing on some of these things, you can do it without extracting from the round, which is really nice to, even in that moment of failure, still understand that you’ve made some progress and earned something as a result.</p>

   <p>And then on the other side of it, we have what we kind of call “economic safety nets.” So we have the free loadout, which has no strings attached, you can just always choose it and have kind of a minimum quality of play while you’re using those kits. And then we have Scrappy the rooster, and he’ll give you a drip feed of materials so that you’re able to craft a few things as you go. And we’ve actually tuned him so that if you’re having a bad run of luck, he provides you with a touch more crafting materials compared to someone who’s being highly successful.</p>  <p>What we found in earlier tests is that highly successful players didn’t need [Scrappy as much]. But then the people who actually needed [the extra resources] were the ones who were getting left behind. So with all of that in mind, we wanted to shave off the those pointy edges [of the genre] so players who are maybe more nervous around this type of game or are apprehensive about how punishing it can be can fall back on these things and still feel like they’re capable of having fun and playing the game in the intended fashion as opposed to being down to just your knife and running it and going “I hope this works, I guess.”</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Cool. Am I a bad person for camping the elevator to kill players as they try to extract?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: [laughs] I mean. No. It is a tactic. It’s been an interesting topic around that because we try to provide enough alternate ways out, and of course, the amount of extraction points reduces as the round goes on. You have the hatch keys that you can use to go out the quieter way. Of course, extraction camping is a concern in any of these games, but when we go and look at our telemetry for how players actually behave around extractions, the incidence rate, as far as we can tell, of extraction camping is incredibly low.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639882"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639882">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What you’ll tend to see is people making a decision, “oh, I hear [the elevator coming up]. Maybe I’ll go for it.” But in terms of like, literally just waiting there, it is a way to play and if you’re successful at it, I imagine you can get a decent bump in [loot] if you’re a good enough player to hold out there, but it tends to be that you’ll draw more attention [by camping]. Flares go off from people you’re fighting, drones get curious and they come investigating. So, hopefully things are tuned and positioned around those extractions enough where it’s not like, say, a perfect strategy, but it’s certainly an opportunistic one.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Where do you think the line is between aggressive playstyles and toxicity?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Yeah, that’s a tough one, right? I think, because we have some social systems, we have emotes, we’ve got proximity voice, I certainly think players could, if they so chose, turn those into a toxic element. We’ve seen a couple of instances where people bring like 10 defibs [items used to revive another player quickly] and then revive people and then kill them again, so we put in a few things like being able to accept revives rather than being at the whim of someone else. You should always have some agency over yourself where you can choose to surrender instead of being subjected [to abuse].</p> <p>But yeah, of course it’s a risk once you give players this level of autonomy. There’s gonna be people who take advantage of it.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: What’s your ideal run in a round of <i>Arc Raiders</i>?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I tend to play in a non-hostile manner such that I won’t necessarily seek out fights, but I will take them if they start it with me. So I like trying to take a more contemplative approach. I’ll try to use where the drones are or aren’t, what the drones are doing and noticing, and I’ll use that information.</p> <p>I tend to be a very evasive player. Even if someone starts a fight with me, if I’m not very, very confident that I can win that fight in that moment, I will do enough to make them panic, and I will disengage and move somewhere else entirely, and maybe take the fight again from a different angle, or just disappear and let them run around and try to find me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639896">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s kind of like Batman or something. I just disappear and then I’m doing something else, which I find really fun, trying to work around groups of players to still get what I need while taking fights when possible.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: There are a lot of bushes and hiding spots in the game. At what point is a hiding spot unfair?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: What we’ve tried to do with our combat balance is that we have a longer TTK (time-to-kill) and alongside approachability, one of the primary tenets of designing this game is that you should always have time to understand and react to what is happening to you.</p> <p>And that does not guarantee that you will succeed in your reaction, but you should at least be capable of ascertaining what led to [a bad] situation and what could have changed the outcome next time you go into that situation.</p>

 <p>So on even footing, the way the TTK is balanced, if you’re full health and full shields, and so am I, if you attack me first, there’s a solid chance that I will probably be able to back away, disengage, do something to kind of mitigate that situation, because we really like when our fights are a lot of back and forth rather than just instantaneous.</p> <p>And of course, if you’re on super low health, then sure, you might get into a bad situation, but I think that comes along with trying to soften the blow of defeat. You should be capable of running again and learning in a more rapid manner.</p>

 <p>But I guarantee there’s gonna be places people find where they’re like, yeah, this is actually a really prime hiding spot, and I can do a lot from here and I can’t be touched. But that is where, again, things like noise traps, how much attention drones pay to noise and your movements and things, so wherever possible, we give a lot of clues to people moving into spaces or through spaces. If they’re paying attention, they can probably pick up on the fact that someone’s nearby, and even your characters once in close proximity to them, you’re hearing the foley of their outfit and their footsteps.</p> <p>So unless someone’s literally holding exactly still, we try to give as many opportunities as possible for you to be aware of others around you.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b><i>: </i>How much time do you anticipate a player spending on <i>Arc Raiders</i> in a week?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I would guess, just for the type of game this is and the type of player I expect to go on, it’s probably something on the order of like four to 10 hours would be my personal guess. There’s enough different things to do that you, you’re not literally just doing like one run over and over. You’re progressing a quest or crafting that new thing or going after this challenge.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Has anything surprised you during the technical tests?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Certainly the clips coming of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">the Leaper going after people</a> have been very, very entertaining.</p>   <p>Like, of course, we already kind of knew what it could do, but I think so many of us [at Embark] are already familiar with how it maneuvers and the way it tries to engage that I think we almost inherently play around that just from the outset. Whereas players now are coming into contact with it for the first time and it’s causing them to lead it into and engage it in very bizarre locations that still work out to be very compelling.</p>   <p>And that was just kind of a happy coincidence. Like we did some changes to it so that it was more capable of navigating places like that and it just worked out now, and I’m pretty excited to see once players get it in the other maps with some other very unique geometry and setups, how it’s gonna surprise them.</p> <hr> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 30, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld monster-capture patent applications has been rejected by the Japanese Patent Office as it “lacked an inventive step”.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been battling PocketPair, the publisher of Palworld, in a patent infringement lawsuit for some time now. Most recently, we had heard a patent expert say that Nintendo is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“so wrong it hurts”</a> regarding mods not being counted as prior art. Now, prior art is the main reason why Nintendo’s patent application was rejected in Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patent-rejected-due-to-prior-art-references-including-ark-monster-hunter-4-and-more">Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patent Rejected Due to Prior Art References Including ARK, Monster Hunter 4, and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo’s rejected patent application, 2024-031879, was a subclaim of one of the anti-Palworld monster-capture patents and a parent of another. It was dismissed for lack of an inventive step, meaning it did not involve an innovative idea that was not an obvious combination of two or more pre-existing concepts. Several games were cited as prior art references. </p>



<p>The patent office determined, through a third-party submission of prior art, that this step existed before Nintendo’s December 2021 priority date, with games such as Studio Wildcard’s ARK, Capcom’s Monster Hunter 4, Pocketpair’s Craftopia, Kantai Collection, and Pokémon GO using it. However, the refusal was non-final, meaning Nintendo can either abandon this patent or file a new patent application with amended claims. </p>

                <p>I think we can all agree that a good title makes a great first impression, especially in the busy landscape of video games. Look no further than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</a>, an indie RPG game from developer Fix-a-Bug whose satirical tone is quite obvious from the jump. Can you believe it had an even funnier name in Japan?</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/28/158848.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game*Spark</a> (h/t <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-who-accidentally-listed-game-as-shitty-dungeon-in-japan-says-steam-wishlists-skyrocketed-in-aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> for the translation and reporting) the game's developer Paolo Nicoletti admitted a hilarious anecdote from its development. Earlier this year, Nicoletti uploaded a demo for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles to Steam that boasted a hilarious, not to mention inappropriate, title instead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbyHmklgDWg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PbyHmklgDWg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's name had been localized to Kuso Dungeon, which translates (in the tamest language) to "Crap Dungeon." While <em>kuso </em>is a term that, throughout Asia at least, can broadly denote campiness or parody--making its usage here incredibly appropriate--it can also be misinterpreted to mean any number of Japanese curse words. You see where this is going now.</p><p>In the interview, Nicoletti shares that the unfortunate naming--the result of a less-than-professional-grade localization job--was a complete accident, but one that nonetheless bolstered the game's profile, making for "truly accidental marketing at its finest." Evidently, Japanese audiences started seeing The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles pop up on their Steam feeds while bearing its laughably funny moniker, and as a result, the game went viral on X for a few days. Additionally, its Steam wishlists enjoyed a nice bump in the region.</p><p>Though the title has now been fixed, its seems like the incident has been a boon for Nicoletti and their team, who admitted that the developers were laughing alongside everyone else before quickly fixing the error. Now, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles and its developer are enjoying a great deal more positive buzz than they might have received with a more standard title.</p>

<p>"We're not using generative AI to develop Subnautica 2," Abramo wrote. "We have an 'AI system' in the game that is similar to ones that have always been in our games: the creature behavior trees."</p><p>Abramo then pointed players to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1M4b6PneFk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September 16 developer vlog</a>, which went into detail about the "creature behavior trees" the team uses in the game. According to AI gameplay lead engineer Antonio Muñoz Gallego, Unknown Worlds Entertainment uses "classic AI," a form of the tech that "improves the hero trees" to make creatures more reactive to player inputs and environmental happenings. It's all a very tech-y way of saying that Subnautica 2's AI is built by humans rather than code generated by other forms of code.</p><p>As such, Abramo said that players can rest assured knowing that the developers won't use generative AI for Subnautica 2 because the team's workflow has already been established.</p><p>"It is very unlikely that that will change," Abramo continued. "We already have a lot of our teams, pipelines, and systems set up. But, ultimately, our relationship with Krafton is the same as it has always been. They provide us access to valuable tools and resources, and we choose which are the right fit for our projects."</p><p>This comes after Krafton Inc.--publisher of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica/" data-ref-id="5000-244763">Subnautica</a> games, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-started-work-on-hi-fi-rush-2-before-microsoft-closure/1100-6526814/" data-ref-id="1100-6526814">Tango Gameworks' upcoming Hi-Fi Rush 2</a>--announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">a $70 million investment into generative AI</a> to become a leading force for the controversial technology in the games industry.

            <p>A new selection of downloadable games are coming to PlayStation Plus this November, as a modern horror classic gets cycled out alongside the Halloween season.</p>
<p>The new games coming to PlayStation Plus in November are Stray, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, and EA WRC 24. They'll be taking the place of Alan Wake II, Cocoon, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> on the 4th November</p>
<p>These games will be downloadable for any PlayStation Plus user with any version of the subscription service, including those with the basic essential tier. So be sure to grab 'em while they're available.</p>

<p>Diving a bit into the games up for grabs, Stray is a beloved adventure game that places you in the shoes (or paws?) of a cat as they explore a gorgeous cyber cityscape. It's available for download on PS4 and PS5, and is for sure the spotlight addition to this month's line-up.</p><p>You've then got Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. This is a wobbly large-scale battle simulator where you line up armies of red and blue jiggly forces and watch them clash to humorous effect. It sounds strange but it's a great laugh, as are all the Totally Accurate games from Landfall. Fun fact, Landfall are one half of the indie dream team that made Peak, which should be an indicator of charm. You can download this for PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Finally, EA WRC 24 is the latest and, sadly, one of the last racing games Codemasters made before falling on hard times recently. A brilliant rally racing game, this high-intensenty title will have you compete in seasons and get behind the wheel of various meticulously recreated race cars. WRC stands as a fantastic game today, even as mass layoffs hit Codemasters, so give it a download and show some love to the folks who made it. You can download EA WRC 24 via PlayStation Plus on the PS5.</p>

			<p>While AI can streamline the video game development process, it would never be able to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game, according to Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick, as current models lack something very important.</p>



<p>Speaking about AI usage in video game development at <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's Technology Executive Council Summit</a> in New York on October 28, the CEO of Rockstar Games' parent company made it clear that the current models would be unable to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game. For starters, using AI to create intellectual property creates issues not only with protecting one's own but also with respecting other's properties.</p>



<p>Even if there were no constraints on AI, it wouldn't be possible to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game, according to Strauss Zelnick. <em>"Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the ‘Grand Theft Auto’ marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>What would prevent AI from making a very good Grand Theft Auto game is the lack of creativity, which is inherent to all AI models. These predictive models based on data sets of old information can work relatively well in certain fields, but not in the creation of the <em>"multi-layered universes that Take-Two’s video games have become known for,"</em> Strauss Zelnick said.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The team’s creativity is extraordinary, and what Rockstar Games tries to do, and so far has done over and over again, is create something that approaches perfection. There is no creativity that can exist by definition in any AI model, because it is data-driven,”</em> Zelnick concluded.</p>



<p>Although the Take-Two CEO makes an extremely valid point, the video game industry seems divided on the usage of AI. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA is pushing heavily for its employees to use AI for basically every task</a>, ranging from coding to QA, while others, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima</a>, see it as a tool to make large game development sustainable in the future and enhance creativity.</p>

              <div data-gpnav="columns"> <p><em>New World: Aeternum</em> stood out as an impressive milestone for Amazon Game Studios. A hit MMO at launch, it will now be remembered as an unfortunate sacrifice on the altar of the tech giant’s coming AI transformation. The company has announced that <em>New World</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-amazon-mmo-shutting-down-servers-2026-layoffs-new-content-2000639761">will get no more new content</a>. It’s not shutting down this instant, but it seems unlikely to last beyond 2026. Fans are understandably upset, and they’re current plastering the game’s Steam review section with colorful critiques of Amazon.</p> </div>  <p>A victim of the company’s newly announced retreat from AAA game development as it culls a <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">staggering 14,000 employees</a> from its payrolls, <em>New World</em> was deemed “no longer sustainable to continue supporting…with new content updates.” The reaction on the game’s Steam page has been swift, with over 1,000 new negative reviews since Amazon informed fans it was pulling the plug.</p>  <div role="heading" aria-level="1"> <p>“Recently started playing was enjoying it, now its being shut down because Amazon being Amazon,” wrote one Steam reviewer. “Recently bought some marks of fortune to buy some in game cosmetics for a game I thought was gonna be a long lasting live-service MMORPG, especially after the general positive reception of <em>Nighthaven</em> and they are shutting down the servers lmao,” wrote another.</p> </div>  <p>There’s never a good moment to reveal you’re abandoning your flagship MMO, but the news comes just a couple of weeks after the game’s season 10 Nighthaven update went live. That and the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion needed to access it are being made free to all players, but no one who’s recently spent money on the game buying content will be getting any refunds.</p>  <p>After drifting below 10,000 concurrent players on Steam during the last year,&nbsp;<em>New</em>&nbsp;<em>World</em> saw a decent resurgence this month, peaking at over 50,000 concurrents after the new content went live. Some fans are blaming corporate greed rather than any unique live-service failings on the part of<em> New World</em> and the MMO’s developers.</p>  <div role="heading" aria-level="1"> <p>“Was fun but then amazon killed it,” a player wrote in the review section. “Bought it the same day the announced it was shutting down, screw you amazon,” wrote another. A third didn’t hold back either. “An amazing game that finally got footing and headwind only to be shutdown because Amazon wants more AI,” they wrote. “No seriously that’s the reason from Amazon for the the mass layoffs that shuttered the studio. Don’t buy it it’ll be shutdown in 8 months.”</p> </div>

                <p>With the leap of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">Halo to PlayStation 5</a>, some observers have facetiously declared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-declares-the-console-wars-officially-over-with-halo-on-ps5/1100-6535718/" data-ref-id="1100-6535718">the console wars to be over</a>. Despite rumors that Microsoft is getting out of the console business, the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">working with AMD on future consoles and devices</a>. Now, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shared some thoughts about the next Xbox, which may indicate that it will be more like a PC.</p><p>"We want to do innovative work on the system side, on the console and PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the [Xbox] console and PC as two different things," said Nadella during an appearance on <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBPN</a>. "We built a console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. So I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled ... I'm really looking forward to the next console."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The consoles wars are now over.

A separate report lays the potential blame on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Microsoft's sky-high profit goals</a>, which some observers believe are harming the company.</p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled its latest campaign to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">integrate AI and voice controls into every Windows 11</a> machine. Xbox box gaming boss Phil Spencer also came out and said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-primarily-uses-ai-for-security-so-far-says-phil-spencer/1100-6535672/" data-ref-id="1100-6535672">the company uses AI for security purposes</a>, rather than for creative decisions when making games. But it remains to be seen if that continues.</p>

            <p>Capcom has released its latest bi-annual financial report, revealing among other interesting tidbits that Monster Hunter: Wilds sales have drastically fallen. In fact, it has fallen so much that Monster Hunter: Rise outsold it in recent months.</p>
<p>The financial report, <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">which can be read in full on the official Capcom website</a>, shows a table on page six breaking down game sales across the first half of this financial year. This table shows that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has sold 637,000 units across all platforms so far in the financial year. For comparison, the prior game in the series Monster Hunter: Rise has sold 643,000.</p>
<p>Why has Monster Hunter; Wilds suffered such a loss in momentum? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Well, while the game started off incredibly popular</a>, substantial technical issues following its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">hampered its continued growth</a>. Capcom's president even put blame on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">how expensive the PS5 was for lacklustre console sales</a>.</p>

<p>The fiscal report does contain far more interesting nuggets, even if you stayed glued to the aforementioned table. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> continues to sell well all these years later, racking up a lifetime sales figure of 10,784,000 which is not shabby whatsoever. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> is doing well too, selling an additional 1,085,000 units so far in the financial year, indicating continued interest in the competitive fighting game.</p><p>Of course, the table is packed full of various modern <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, each seeming to have substantial staying power. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> is the top performer so far in the year, and even the Resident Evil 3: Remake (which personally speaking is a tad underrated) pulled off 697,000 sales this far into the financial year.</p>
<p>Though for a more macro look at how Capcom is doing, all one needs to do is take a look at page two of the presentation, where major takeaways are listed as: "Revenue and profit grew year-on-year across all segments.  Achieved highest-ever total and catalog unit sales for a H1 period. Favorable performance in Amusement Equipments business." So while Monster Hunter: Wilds isn't doing so hot, the company as a whole seems to be doing quite well.</p>

            <p>In their first set of financial results since <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/control-studio-remedy-issues-profit-warning-due-to-weak-sales-of-fbc-firebreak/">issuing a profit warning</a> and switching CEOs earlier this month, Remedy have revealed that they're moving resources away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> amid a "sense of urgency", and aiming to rely on established series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Control delivering hits which'll shore up their commercial fortunes in the long-term.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In these <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf">latest financial results</a>, Remedy reported a loss of €16.4 million between July and September 2025, in contrast to the €2.4 million profit it made the same time last year, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> had been out of the door less than a year. Remedy co-founder Markus Mäki - who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-after-nine-years">stepped into the role of interim CEO</a> last week, replacing former CEO Tero Virtala not long after Firebreak's sales disappointment - says his job's been "to raise the bar and the sense of urgency across the organization, and to drive stronger results".</p>
<p>So, given Firebreak's sales have only gone up "marginally" as the studio have delivered updates, they're unsurprisingly shifting chess pieces elsewhere. "We continue working on features which enhance player value, and which are justified by our updated long-term sales expectations," the results doc reads. "We have moved development resources to our other in-development titles while respecting our communicated roadmap for FBC: Firebreak."</p>
<p>As for what the studio are banking on to arrest their number slumpage, Mäki says they plan on making big hit games that people like. More concretely, he indicated Remedy's focus in the short-term and until 2030 is mainly to lean on their established series, Alan Wake and Control, to keep growing and deliver these hits. Though, the fact the studio'll be "carefully balancing our product risk" with the need to create "new experiences" suggests future spin-offs being relied on as hits probably won't be as big a leaps into the unknown as Firebreak was, being Remedy's first crack at multiplayer.</p><p>For now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> being developed alongside Rockstar remain in the works. There's also an unnamed new project listed as being in the proof of concept stages at Remedy. Given the emphasis on their plan to rely on Control and Alan Wake, as well as need to stick to proveable hits, it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to imagine it could be something Wake-ish. Don't quote me on that though, we'll have to wait and see whenever this mysterious thing's revealed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and good day. Welcome to Wednesday, perhaps the most meh day of the week. You ain’t not Friday, but you aren’t as bad as Monday. Anyway, welcome to latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we’re looking at a cool new box set from Nintendo, checking in on the Game Awards, getting updates for games you can’t buy anymore, and remembering how cool <em>Day of the Tentacle</em> was and still is in 2025.</p> <h2>Nintendo’s $180+ <em>Breath of the Wild</em> vinyl soundtrack release is a test</h2> <p>On October 29, Nintendo announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m4dlbecutr2k">a new 8-LP <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> soundtrack box set</a> featuring 134 remastered songs. The newly announced soundtrack will be available in June 2026 and can be pre-ordered starting today. The box set will also include archival artwork created by the development team.</p>   <p>This is a rare move for Nintendo, which normally doesn’t release physical soundtracks for its games in the United States. But this new box set, as well as a cheaper double LP offering up 34 select tracks from the game, is being used as a way to “gauge” how many people over here want something like this, according to Nintendo.</p>

 <p>“In the Japanese market, CD is still a pretty prominent format there, and they do a lot of video game soundtracks on CD in Japan, and they’ve been doing that for years and years,” Nintendo VP of player &amp; product experience <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-vinyl-1236564363/">Bill Trinen told<em>&nbsp;Variety</em></a>. “Here in the U.S., we haven’t been releasing much in the way of physical soundtracks at all. And so partly, this is a little bit about us trying to gauge and understand what is the demand for physical soundtracks in the United States. Part of this is also simply an interest in trying to bring video game music to a broader audience, and it’s part of a few steps that we’ve taken.”</p> <h2>Apple is now on the Game Awards advisory board</h2> <p>Apple’s gaming push continues, with the tech giant now becoming a member of the Game Awards advisory board alongside companies like Rockstar Games, Sony, EA, and Epic. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/apple-has-been-appointed-to-the-game-awards-advisory-board/#google_vignette"><em>VGC</em> spotted the news</a> via the <a href="https://thegameawards.com/about">official Game Awards website,</a> which was recently updated to include Apple on the list of board members. To be clear, the advisory board doesn’t have any involvement in what games are nominated, or which ones win. So Apple won’t be helping pick this year’s Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s annual trailer extravaganza (featuring some awards), but it will be rubbing elbows with more of the gaming industry. How many Apple Arcade commercials will we see this year? My bet is at least two!</p>

 <h2><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> gets another Switch 2 update, still not for sale again</h2> <p>Remember <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>? It was that awesome collection of 3D <em>Mario</em> games<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>SM64, Galaxy, </em>and<em> Sunshine<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></em>that Nintendo launched in 2020. And then stopped selling after just six months as part of a limited-time celebration of the franchise’s 35th anniversary. Five years later, Nintendo still hasn’t made the games available again to buy on its store (well, except for <em>Galaxy</em> which recently got a remaster that costs $40 all by itself). But if you do own <em>3D All-Stars</em>, good news: It just got another update to help it run better on Switch 2. This keeps happening, <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-all-stars-switch-2-sunshine-gamecube-1851786291">with the collection getting an update in July,</a> and it’s extremely frustrating. Why is this package not available to buy on Switch and Switch 2 in 2025? Come on, Nintendo, let people give you money.</p> <h2>The <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake has now sold over 16 million copies</h2> <p>The best-selling <em>Resident Evil</em> game continues to sell well.<em> Resident Evil 2</em> remake has now sold over 16 million copies,<a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf"> according to Capcom’s latest financial report.</a> But interestingly, <em>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</em> is catching up. This latest report shows the soft reboot of the horror franchise has now reached 15.9 million copies sold. With <em>Resident Evil 7</em> <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/switch2/en-us/">making the leap to Switch 2</a> in 2026, it’s likely that this entry might overtake the <em>RE2</em> remake to become the biggest game in the survival horror series.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s new map isn’t very good and feels too small</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">Amazon is scaling down its gaming plans and laying off thousands</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568">Check out our <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the best parts of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is that its single-city setting illustrates the power of community building and the importance of public services. Its cast of trainers come from different walks of life and all contribute something different to Lumiose City. However, we’re not here to talk about the streamer, socialite, or mob boss. We’re here to talk about the true backbone of Lumiose City’s urban redevelopment plan: the Poké Ball Collector.</span></p> <p><span>These unnamed men show up throughout Lumiose, typically next to a Pokémon Center, and if you ever see them with a yellow text bubble above their heads, you should talk to them immediately. See, these handsome gentlemen are part of the city’s clean-up crew, but they focus on a specific type of trash littered around town: Poké Balls. Every time you misthrow one of these capture devices at the local wildlife, these guys are right behind you, collecting these relics of your Pokémon training failures to give them back to you so you don’t have to buy more balls when perfectly good ones are lying around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-wild-zone-17-pyroar-alpha-memes-2000639332">Wild Zones</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Crucially, he will only pick up ones that miss their target, not ones that fail to capture a Pokémon because you didn’t weaken them enough in battle. But even so, that’s such a handy quality-of-life change that I’m surprised it took </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>nearly 30 years to implement. I guess it works best when your game is set in one city, and thus it makes sense to have dedicated systems and workers who can devote their shifts to this. But it’s especially helpful in a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game in which you throw Poké Balls manually and can miss your target if you’re carelessly tossing them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now these collectors are amassing a ton of fans, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw them featured in other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>media moving forward. A guy who picks up garbage and brings it back to you is just waiting for a trading card that lets you pick through your discard pile.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">the true hero of Pokémon Legends: Z-A <a href="https://t.co/zGdGYjNOcs">pic.twitter.com/zGdGYjNOcs</a></p> <p>— Out of Context Pokémon (@OoCPokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/OoCPokemon/status/1982492422689951862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i am not good at this game <a href="https://t.co/eVJzmun6n3">pic.twitter.com/eVJzmun6n3</a></p> <p>— Dyylas (@DylanDyylas) <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanDyylas/status/1982482065431114123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When nobody else got me I know unnamed ball collector man got me <a href="https://t.co/SjifPJR3zq">https://t.co/SjifPJR3zq</a> <a href="https://t.co/tuPLZWvU8w">pic.twitter.com/tuPLZWvU8w</a></p> <p>— skipppppy 🍉/COMMS OPEN!!/ (@skipppppy_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/skipppppy_art/status/1982051705798656394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE:</p> <p>HIS NAME IS LEANDRO AND HE LIKES ELECTRIC TYPES <a href="https://t.co/eOvZX2exvl">https://t.co/eOvZX2exvl</a> <a href="https://t.co/ttIRJOfVam">pic.twitter.com/ttIRJOfVam</a></p> <p>— skipppppy 🍉/COMMS OPEN!!/ (@skipppppy_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/skipppppy_art/status/1983288380118184043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>     <p><span>As far as I’m concerned, Poké Ball collectors need to become a new standard for the series alongside Nurse Joy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation Plus’s free monthly games for this month have been revealed, and they arrive on November 4. </p>



<p>It is finally that time of the month when we get to see what the next set of free games is arriving for PlayStation Plus subscribers. We already knew BlueTwelve Studio and Annapurna Interactive’s Stray would be part of the collection through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-november-headline-game-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent leak</a>. Now, the other 2 other games have been revealed as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-plus-essential-games-for-november-include-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-and-tabs">PlayStation Plus Essential Games for November Include Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, and TABS</h2>



<p>As mentioned previously, Stray is the headline for PlayStation Plus in November 2025. Along with Stray, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that EA Sports WRC 24 and TABS (Totally Accurate Battle Simulator) will be arriving on November 4, 2025. These games will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers, including Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe members.</p>



<p><strong>Stray</strong></p>



<p>For those unaware, in Stray, players get to play as a cat in an ancient, decaying cybercity. You get to explore the murky environments and the seedy underbelly of this city as you unravel its mystery. At the same time, you get to be a cat, as you interact with different elements of the world in playful and fun ways. </p>



<p><strong>EA Sports WRC 24</strong></p>



<p>EA Sports WRC 24 is an award-winning offshoot of the Dirt Rally series, where players can drive WRC, WRC2, and Junior WRC cars from the 2024 season. This instalment also debuts the builder mode, which allows players to design and drive their dream rally car, and to rewrite history through recreations of recent events and significant historical highlights in Moments mode. Additionally, players can try out Championship, Time Trial, Cross-platform Multiplayer, Regularity Rally, and a detailed livery editor. </p>



<p><strong>TABS Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</strong></p>



<p>Last but not least is a physics-based battle simulator where players get to be the leaders of red and blue wobbles from ancient lands, spooky places, and fantasy worlds. There are over 100+ types of wobblers to try out, and if players get bored with them, they can always design new ones in the unit creators. There’s also an online multiplayer mode to test your mettle against friends and strangers. </p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation Plus players can grab Battlefield 6’s REDSEC Battle Royale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-rogue-ops-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue Ops pack for free</a>.

<p>We are finally returning to the streets, as NBA The Run, an upcoming 3v3 online title from Play by Play Studios, is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 has been released and has already become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States for 2025</a>. However, even after that game, players have been craving a classic NBA Streets experience, and now, Play by Play Studios has arrived to fill that void. Learn more about the fast-paced, online 3v3 street basketball game, NBA The Run, below. </p>



<h2 id="h-nba-the-run-will-have-players-playing-against-nba-stars-and-all-new-street-legends">NBA The Run Will Have Players Playing Against NBA Stars and All-New Street Legends</h2>



<p>In NBA The Run, players will explore a collection of legendary outdoor courts to indulge in some 3v3 basketball action. You will get to play against a roster of NBA legends along with a set of Street Legends, which are “fictional players with big personalities, wild skills and stories to tell.”</p>



<p>The developer’s goal is to make all aspects of the game enjoyable, which is why Defense has been designed to be as fun as Offense. Defence will need skills like anticipation, timing, and impact, while players use moves such as massive blocks, lightning steals, shoves, dives, and more. Offense is going to help players make their highlight reels with all kinds of flashy moves, including Double alley-oops, posterizing dunks, off-the-backboard passes, step-back threes, and ankle-breaking combos.</p>

<h2 id="h-nba-the-run-will-feature-rollback-netcode-low-latency-cross-platform-play-and-knockout-tournaments">NBA The Run Will Feature Rollback Netcode, Low-Latency, Cross-Platform Play, and Knockout Tournaments</h2>



<p>To make the experience “fast, fluid, and connected,” the game features low-latency, cross-platform gameplay that is always in sync. Knockout Tournaments will be the major competitions in NBA The Run, where players can enter bracket-style events solo (controlling your whole team) or in squads (one player per teammate). The tournaments will include new Randomized Rules — from Dunkfest to Speed Round and will last 2-5 minutes. </p>

                <p>A datamine has revealed when players will be able to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> full suite of player-housing systems, giving an indication of when the MMORPG's next expansion will launch in full.</p><p dir="ltr">As datamined by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-splash-screen-reveals-midnight-pre-patch-launches-by-january-27th-379054#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the Midnight pre-patch, which will introduce class changes and new systems (though not the actual new zones, dungeons, or other expansion content) looks to be coming on or around January 27, 2026. The datamined splash screen for the patch points out Neighborhoods, the void-focused Devourer Demon Hunter specialization, and a new pre-patch event called Twilight Ascension as new additions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The event, which looks to have players dealing with cultists of the Twilight Hammer, states it will be available on January 27. That puts the likely release date of the expansion itself in the following three or four weeks sometime in February. Blizzard has not yet given an officiall release date for when Midnight, or the pre-patch, will release.</p><p dir="ltr">While players who preorder Midnight will be able to buy and start decorating their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">homes with the arrival of WoW's 11.2.7 patch</a>, expected in early December, it won't be until the arrival of Neighborhoods that the game's long-awaited player-housing system is fully complete. Neighborhoods allow players to participate in special community events and complete challenges that will unlock new decorations and change the appearance of neighborhoods themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">If the pre-patch event is like previous ones, players should probably expect to kill lots of cultists intent on destroying Azeroth. The event will likely be a great way to level up new characters (like a Devourer Demon Hunter) and get them up to speed with special event catch-up gear.</p><p dir="ltr">The arrival of the pre-patch will also bring one other big change to WoW in that it will officially mark the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">end of combat add-ons</a>. Since the launch of the Midnight alpha, Blizzard has revealed the steps it's taking to eliminate the ability to use (and the need for) player-created mods that specialize in assisting players in combat. While it's a worthy goal, some players and add-on makers have been less than happy with how Blizzard has approached the major change in add-on philosophy, with several prominent add-on creators announcing their add-ons won't be updated for Midnight.</p>
