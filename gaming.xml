            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer Invercity Game Works has unveiled a new survival action game titled Project Retrograde: The Becoming with a trailer published on IGN's YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The game looks heavily inspired by CAPCOM's survival horror franchise Resident Evil. Perhaps a little too much, in fact. Anyway, it's being developed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and there's no public release window yet. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nixinggame.com/en/invercity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> offers a basic overview of what players will find in Project Retrograde: The Becoming:</p>



<p><em>In 1995, humanity's last hope—Project Retrograde—collapsed as the underground world was shattered by the ancient parasite L.U.C.A. Play as a bounty hunter symbiotic with parasite, using its dangerous power to save the world, even if it consumes you.</em></p>



<p><em>Infected by L.U.C.A, you survive and gain the ability to absorb combat memories from other hosts. Unlock parasitic skills, become a Kung Fu master or the Baba Yaga, and experience adrenaline-fueled combat!</em></p>



<p><em>Delve into the post-apocalyptic realm filled with retro technology. Manipulate the LUX system to alter underground weather, or climb towers to reach unknown regions and uncover the truth buried for years.</em></p>

            <p>A group of financial investors are in "advanced talks" with EA to go private with a valuation worth around $50 billion (£37.5 billion).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal (£)</a>, the investors – thought to include equity firm Silver Lake, Affinity Partners, and Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF) – could announce a deal as soon as next week. If true, this would make it the biggest leveraged buyout ever.</p>
<p>News of the potential deal sent EA's share prices rocketing, closing 15 percent higher on Friday.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in FIFA publisher EA</a> back in 2023. The PIF initiative was designed to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p><p>Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, Embracer, Nexon, Capcom, and Ubisoft, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">boss Yves Guillemot secured PIF funding</a>, leading to new DLC for 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city</a>.</p>

It's the weekend once again, but before we dive into what we're playing, let's just do a quick recap of the last week.</p>

<p>Onto the news, and the bigg'un this week is the confirmation that Nintendo of America's President, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">will be retiring at the end of the year</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> was announced for the Switch 2 and will include a brand new tale, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> confirmed an awesome <strong>Mega Man</strong> collaboration for its upcoming DLC.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which was originally due to launch in early October, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">has been delayed to an unspecified date</a>. Not hugely surprising, and to be honest, there's so much coming out in the coming weeks, we'll be happy to wait for this one.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This week I finally finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, by which I mean I rolled credits after almost 30 hours with a 74% completion rate. I've since gone back, collected some more masks and grubs, and killed a couple of optional bosses bringing me up to 81%. I should really step away now - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> isn't going to play itself, and I've run out of things to spend Geo on. BUT! Beating the final trial in the Colosseum of Fools will get me another Pale Ore (I think?), and then I can upgrade my nail one more time, which would be neat. Can I resist seeing that percentage counter go up to 100 112?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I did start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which feels very Ubisoft, but not bad - I'm looking forward to playing more. However, payday arrived and I immediately ticked off one of my wishlist; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a> is now on my Switch 2. Despite lacking official S2 compatibility, I'm going to try it there and switch back to my OLED if I hit problems. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> this weekend and see if that resolution update has actually made a substantial difference. It really is a remarkable game, but man, does it look rough on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is also on the cards, and I'd also like to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a> if I can find the time. Oh, and I've also picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> on the PS5, so that'll be a pretty high priority for me.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I think I’m closing in on the first end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and that’s good news. Not that I want it to end, I should stress, but my backlog from September alone is already looking at me with a hard stare, and I don’t want to picture what it’ll look like after <em>all the games</em> come out in October.</p>
<p>Between Silksong sessions, I’ve been plugging away at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> (also very, very good), and I recently picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> which, I hate to admit, I’ve never actually played. Oh yes, and I have Hades 2 locked and loaded for when I find a minute in-between all that.</p>
<p>So, a nice quiet one then!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Home stretch on Shinobi: Art of Vengeance with every level beckoning an endurance battle of skill, patience and some degree of sheer luck... a regular day for a ninja then. Being a complete sucker for mechs and SRPGS, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> and so far its a blast. It certainly was a long wait but Hades 2 is finally out of early access and a timed exclusive on Switch hardware. I’m a bit rusty but Melinoë certainly stands tall to Zagreus. I was not disciplined enough to have waited till November to pick up the physical edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 19 of 50 games played. Golfaria is quite something!</p>
<p>Game of the week is (still) Star Wars Outlaws. With Kijimi complete, time to head for Akiva on the prowl for a droidsmith. I’m leaving Tatooine for last, looking forward to that.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm sticking with Hades 2 for the foreseeable future, mostly because I want to see <em>everything</em> this game has for me post-credits, but I also want to start afresh and run through the game proper. What a game. Supergiant is far too good to us.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm still fighting the urge to start a fresh save in Silksong. Thankfully we're away this weekend, so I don't think I'll be caving into my vices yet. Enjoy the weekend! Spooky season approaches!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As this is my first trip to Japan, I really had no idea what to expect. With a cultural knowledge based on anime and Yakuza games, that’s probably made me ill-equipped for the safe, respectful and utterly down-to-earth culture I’ve found in Chiba. Nobody has run up to me on the street demanding a brawl, nobody has screamed about an incoming Kaiju, and it’s almost like the real world is not like video games and TV shows. Except that Tokyo Game Show isn’t normal.</p>
<p>I interviewed a man in a rubber mask today. While I’ve been here, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/27/let-it-die-inferno-preview-uncle-death-returns-to-smash-up-the-roguelike/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> has been the focus of lots of my time – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/tokyo-game-show-2025-day-one-report-there-are-a-lot-of-games-here-and-one-of-them-electrocuted-me/">see yesterday’s electrocution</a> – and Gungho and Supertrick Games conducted the interviews for it with one of the development team embodying the iconic Uncle Death from the series. This didn’t so much derail my brain as it sent it charging down a side track into a disused station, but it was surprisingly informative, even if I wondered whether I was about to embark on my own journey into hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today was the day I didn’t get lost. Yesterday I tried to make sense of the Tokyo Game Show’s layout, and I came out utterly lacking. If you enter the show floor, you become trapped in the seventh circle of video games, unable to leave, but unable to move, and I started to see the same landmarks – the Nioh 3 demon, the Wizardry cosplay, the Inazuma Eleven stand – over and over again. Perhaps it was the copious amounts of free Red Bull, but I was utterly stuck yesterday.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Friday showed that I still have the ability to learn, and I was able to make sense, and make headway with the show floor. In fact, I probably got a bit too carried away, whizzing through neon booth after neon booth, and then couldn’t escape as they seem to have a wonderful habit of closing half the exits. Still, I have made it out, but I have now developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, longing once more for my captor.</p>


		
		

<p>Day two was more about discovery, and I bumbled across a bunch of games, starting with the impressive lineup in the Devolver Digital section. They’d created a setup like a traditional Japanese street with lanterns and wooden shutters – overall, I have to say that the stands here took what I’ve seen at EGX and Gamescom to a new level – and nestled amongst them I got to play Ball X Pit and Skate Story, both of which left me thoroughly impressed.</p>
<p>I then happened upon Tiny Metal 2, a sequel to a game that tried to fill the void caused by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo basically giving up on Advance Wars – let’s forget that in the meantime they vaguely remembered about it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars 1+2</a>. Tiny Metal 2, though, is what should happen to this genre, and it’s ramped up the grid-based tactics with a modern makeover and… well, that seems to be about it, but who needs anything more than that?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, TGS has proved the best place for catching up with folks in the industry, and I happened on a friend at the Polish games stand who’d led our cultural exchange mission to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/how-katowice-in-poland-is-aiming-to-become-a-global-gaming-industry-giant/">Digital Dragons in Krakow earlier this year</a>. TGS isn’t just about Japanese development – far from it – and it’s attracted exhibitors from across the globe. It would be interesting to know just how well imports perform in Japan, since this is a nation at the foundation of the modern game development scene, but the exhibitors I talked to all agreed how positive, dedicated and enthusiastic the crowds were.</p>
<p>Based on the number of free bags I saw, the star of TGS 2025 has been Ananta. This upcoming free-to-play game certainly looks cool, but it’s also hard to argue with a giant, neon green rucksack, emblazoned with an anime rabbit girl. It was so big, I saw plenty of punters struggling to know what to do with it, and I swear I caught people in the act of trying to get in there themselves. Oversized bag aside, Ananta is one to keep your eye on, especially as it’s covering all bases with mobile, PC and PlayStation releases.</p>
<p>The importance of mobile to the Japanese gaming scene has surprised me, and there were a host of mobile-only titles with big, main hall stands that have clearly got the budget and the backing to make a serious dent in other people’s wallets. It feels far more like a legitimate part of the gaming landscape here than it does in Europe, and it’s well worth remembering that gaming doesn’t start and stop with consoles and PC, especially when our phones can pump out things like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The end of yesterday produced one further surprise in the shape of the canned goods bar. This is a bar where you grab a tiny shopping basket – like one you’d give to a three-year-old to play shopkeeper with – fill it with canned goods, and they’re then dispensed cold to you as a bar snack while you drink a craft beer. This was weird enough, but the fact that Spam sat happily amongst the bespoke produce as a culinary delight was the point I decided it was probably time for bed.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Game Show has proved to be an incredible celebration of the Japanese and international game development scene. The end of this year, and then on into 2026, looks like it will bring a cavalcade of great releases, and, as ever, Japan remains at the centre of that. I can only hope that I get to cover TGS again in the future, as I’ve never found a safer, more welcoming and more engaged show in all the years I’ve been writing about games. If you get the opportunity to go, make sure you take it!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you call your game Let It Die, you’re sending a clear message to your players. The thing is, the first Let It Die game – released all the way back in 2016 – probably did want you to die, because its free-to-play business model meant that if you died, you could pay real-world money to revive yourself.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, that didn’t really catch on in a wider sense – imagine if Elden Ring charged you each time you died? – but it caught on enough that Let It Die is now entering its 32nd season and remains one of the most unique FTP titles we’ve ever seen. It’s little surprise then to herald the arrival of its direct sequel, Let It Die: Inferno, but this is now a roguelike that’s taking everything good about the original and turning it into a full-price premium game. A Let It Die game without the microtransactions? That’s definitely worth talking about.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Roguelikes weren’t really all that popular back in 2016, so in some ways, the first Let It Die was seriously ahead of its time. Given that pretty much everything is a roguelike now, it feels as though Let It Die: Inferno is coming out at the perfect time, ready to hoover up all the more recent fans of the genre. Producer Shin Hideyuki told us, “Absolutely, this was the best time for it. In the original game, it had the concept where if you die, it’s over. And that concept in this game is even more pronounced. Death is still something that’s kind of taken lightly because the more you die, the stronger you will become, but it will still be an over-the-top, overwhelming death.”</p>
<p>We didn’t get to see all that much narrative framing through our hands-on, but given that the original was largely centred on you being at the whim of the idiosyncratic Uncle Death, that’s probably all the motivation you need. Uncle Death himself – or at least a member of the team who was wearing the rubber mask – told us, “He’s going to be making appearances in the game in that aspect. So, the electricity you experienced yesterday [they strapped me to a machine that electrocuted me when I took damage] was all him, and anything you see in the Let It Die world is probably his idea. In many ways, this is the game made for Uncle Death and, sort of, by Uncle Death if you will.”</p>


<p>That’s all getting a bit meta, but what is clear is that the team at Supertrick Games are thoroughly set on embodying and imagining the game that its iconic frontman would make. Given that they spun off from the original Grasshopper Manufacture devs, and that the follow-up Deathverse: Let It Die took the franchise into a creative cul-de-sac, it’s not all that surprising that they want to be true to the original ethos of Let It Die. Through our hands on, that seems to have been achieved with plenty of success.</p>
<p>While you still begin the game with a spot of character selection, Let It Die: Inferno sees those choices become more curated, and the ‘Body of the Day’ basically has you choosing between different builds with different starting stats. Through our demo, Timothy has balanced stats and healing skills, while Pearl specializes in offense, and has skills that can break through enemy defenses with ease. In action, Pearl certainly had the upper hand in our playthrough, so much so that I accidentally make it all the way to the boss without levelling her up, but one of the team members reassured me that death at any point is a good thing.</p>
<p>This being a roguelike, death is the point of the game. As you die, you can turn some of the accumulated experience or currency into permanent upgrades, meaning that the next time out, things are going to be easier, and you’re going to make it just a little bit further. They’ve also retained a flavour of Deathverse: Let It Die with a Battle Royale-like system that sees you fighting against a clock, trying to make as much progress and then escape before the area becomes utterly toxic to your character.</p>
<p>The team told us, “This time you have escape pods that are inside the levels, and they’re placed randomly through every run. You have a time limit in which you have to reach these escape pods to get out of the level. You might just completely luck out and get an escape pod right near you. So that is just good luck, but there are times where you will absolutely not find one, and in those times it is definitely going to be very challenging.”</p>

<p>The roguelike framing for Let It Die: Inferno feels like it’s stronger than ever, and that fight, that rush to collect experience within the time span, just works incredibly well. I really wanted to push the boundaries, and after my death to the first boss, all I wanted to do was jump back in with another run. That bodes very well.</p>
<p>After the last game’s short-lived success, it was clear that the team didn’t want to repeat the same mistakes, but there were still important lessons to be learned from it. They told us, “In Deathverse, the previous title, we couldn’t have PvE – it was more PvP – so that’s something we wanted to include. In Let It Die: Inferno, we’ve managed to put in the PvE aspect while retaining the PvP aspect from Deathverse that players liked.”</p>
<p>That sense of legacy, and that sense of continuation, runs very clearly through Let It Die: Inferno. The combat, the inventory management, and the overarching setup remain absolutely recognisable, but this is the 2025 reimagining of that original vision. The visuals are fantastic – as you’d expect with a jump in generations and the shift to Unreal Engine 5 – and there’s a newfound vibrancy and energy to the game which wasn’t there before. That unique weirdness, that Grasshopper Manufacture flavour, is still here, but it’s been refined and reinvigorated for the modern day.</p>

<p>The key improvement is the game’s shift in business model. From all of the people I’ve spoken to about Let It Die, it’s clear that the number one turn-off was its free-to-play setup. It was clearly an inviting and hardcore roguelike action game – not quite a soulslike, but certainly a challenging hack and slash – and its gameplay loop was perfectly paced to draw you in. It was when it started asking you for money as you died that many players switched off. Hopefully, players will remember just how much fun the combat was and buy into the idea of Let It Die: Inferno as a full-priced title. On early impressions alone, it’s well worth the asking price.<br>
<em><br>
Let It Die: Inferno is due for release on PlayStation 5 and PC on December 3rd, 2025. </em></p>

<p>There's a lot of new game footage on display at Tokyo Game Show this week, and on top of all the Square Enix game trailers, the company has now shared another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>.</p>
<p>This game was announced earlier this month and will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>Now, at Japan's big gaming event, Square Enix has premiered roughly 17 minutes of live gameplay footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@squareenix/streams">during its stage event</a>. The gameplay is featured between 27:43 - 44:39 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-17-minutes-of-tgs-2025-gameplay">thanks, Gematsu</a>), and while it's all in Japanese, there's still enough footage on display to get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>If you didn't catch the news earlier this month, Square Enix has also confirmed there's no upgrade path available or planned for the Switch version. So you'll need to buy the title on Switch 2 if you want to play it on this system. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> (due out next month) also got a trailer yesterday showing off the new underwater region.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Square Enix has also shared roughly 18 minutes of gameplay footage of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> during the same stage event. This title is arriving for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025. You can see the gameplay on display between the 40:00 - 58:10 mark in the video below:</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Sega this week surprised Yakuza fans with the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to Nintendo's new hybrid system early next year on 12th February 2026, and while we've already got a teaser of what to expect, the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has now shared a "first look" at the combat gameplay in Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement, this "evolved edition" is based on Kazuma Kiryu's original PlayStation 3 title, which was released in 2009. And Dark Ties is a brand-new tale starring Yoshitaka Mine (Kiryu's adversary). This package promises to bring not only intense battles but also added cutscenes and reimagines the original outing with cutting-edge visuals.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:188290 @ 1758968180 -->
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will launch for Switch 2 on 12th February 2026 and will be available as a digital and physical release, with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirming it's a game-key card release. Before this, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> are coming to the Switch 2 this November. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-announced-for-switch-2-launching-in-february-2026">previously confirmed</a>, these games are also getting game-key card releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> didn't get off to the best start when it arrived on the Switch 2 in June, but IO Interactive has made an effort since then to improve the overall experience.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the developer has now released <em>another</em> game update, which makes some updates across all platforms and also resolves multiple bugs in the Switch 2 version of the game. This follows an update in August, which added a Frame Rate option to lock the game at 30fps.</p>
<p>The latest update has also been made available alongside the new elusive target mission, featuring Bruce Lee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bruce Lee enters HITMAN World of Assassination as the next Celebrity Elusive target, but this time with a twist. Together with 47, Agent Lee takes his legendary martial arts skills undercover to infiltrate the Concord Union and take them down from the inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187051 @ 1758968454 -->
<p>Here are the patch notes for this latest update, bumping the title up to Version 3.240 (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-3-240-update-out-now-patch-notes-includes-nintendo-switch-2-fixes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>

</nav>
<h2 id="hitman-world-of-assassination-version-3-240">Hitman World of Assassination - Version 3.240</h2>
<h3 id="new-features"><strong>New Features</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Two-Handed Tweaks</strong><br>
Aiming of two-handed weapons has been improved; it is now based on the position of both hands. Previously, it was based on the main hand, adjusted slightly with the support hand.</p>
<p>Collision of weapons when wielded with both hands has also been improved; it is now based around the barrel of the weapon. This should help to prevent drifting when holding a sniper above railings.</p>
<p><strong>Bullet in the Chamber</strong><br>
Last patch, we added tactical reloading, where reloading a non-empty magazine didn’t require you to rack the slide. We have since iterated upon this and the chambered bullet is now visible when racking the slide.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpened Scope</strong><br>
We’ve made some improvements to cases where far away objects could become invisible when looking through a sniper scope, causing great difficulty when sniping from certain vantage points.</p>
<p><strong>Savor the Moment</strong><br>
Various key moments and kill opportunities are now in third person, allowing you to take pride in your work.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive Interactions</strong><br>
We have made various improvements to touch interactions, including adding hand poses when your hand comes into proximity with them.</p>
<p><strong>Screw the Big Screen</strong><br>
We’ve moved some starting and exit cutscenes into 3D instead of using the 2D “cinema mode” screen.</p>
<p><strong>Pistol Placement</strong><br>
When starting a mission, concealed weapons (e.g. pistols) are no longer stored in a hip holster. Instead, they are placed in the inventory wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Firm Grip</strong><br>
We’ve improved the alignment of various items when they’re held.</p>
<p><strong>Holster Feedback</strong><br>
We’ve changed how the feedback works for holsters.</p>
<p><strong>Options Bonanza</strong><br>
We’ve added various options allowing you to refine your experience so that it’s just right.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Aiming</strong>
<ul>
<li>Controls how weapons are aimed when wielding them with both hands. The default is the new positional aiming mode, but this can be changed to the previous behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firearm Angle</strong>
<ul>
<li>Last patch, we added an option allowing you to change the angle of a held firearm. We’ve now split this into two options for one-handed and two-handed weapons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Grip</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabling this allows you to release the grip button while keeping items in your hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All platforms</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultimate Warrior</strong><br>
We’ve added the ability for you to holster two items on your back. Currently, this is restricted to Katanas and the new Kali Sticks from The Bruce Lee Pack, but we are evaluating more items that may benefit from this feature.</p>
<p><strong>Safehouse Shuffle</strong><br>
We’ve added a new gear wall in the Safehouse basement. It is currently used to house items from “The Banker Pack” and “The Bruce Lee Pack” DLCs.</p>
<p><strong>Spooky Safehouse</strong><br>
With Halloween on the horizon, we’ve added some themed cosmetics to the Safehouse. These are available to use now so you can ensure your bones are sufficiently rattled for the big day.</p>
<p><strong>Undercover Antics</strong><br>
We’ve enabled the following disguised entrances in “The Banker” and “The Monarchique”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undercover in the Kitchen (Palace Staff)</li>
<li>Undercover in the Locker Room (Chef)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Store Remodel</strong><br>
The in-game store page has been divided into separate categories to give a clearer overview of what each DLC grants.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
<p><em>As always, many of the fixes below were resolved thanks to reports made by the community. We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who continues to report issues they run into – stay vigilant!</em></p>
<p><strong>Level Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breaking and Entering</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in the Safehouse where the bedroom could be accessed via the bathroom before the required mastery level was reached.</p>
<p><strong>Folded Out of Life</strong><br>
Resolved various situations in The Banker where Le Chiffre could suspend his routine.</p>
<p><strong>Follow No More</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the steps could get stuck on “Follow the Guard”.</p>
<p><strong>Fruitless Escape</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre slipping on a banana peel could trigger the helicopter escape cutscene and cause mission failure.</p>
<p><strong>Leaving a Message, Are We?</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre would talk with General Murillo on the phone, even if he was otherwise indisposed.</p>
<p><strong>No More Stalling</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in The Banker where using some interactions while poisoned stopped 47 from being properly relocated when the timer ran out.</p>
<p><strong>Sore Loser</strong><br>
Le Chiffre will now flee when on high alert or when the VIP Room chandelier is broken. This resolves an issue where the poker game could “continue” despite the broken chandelier rendering the table unusable.</p>
<p><strong>The House Always Wins</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in The Banker that let players distract the cashier while being handed chips, causing them to be duplicated indefinitely. The casino’s ledgers are balanced again.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky Trespassing</strong><br>
Fixed inconsistent trespassing zones the lounge found in The Banker where the zone extended past the intended barrier posts. We’ve also fixed staff disguises being regarded as hostile in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Intuitive</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza where breaking the glass on the display case and walking on a bag of potatoes in the butcher shop allowed Agent 47 to walk on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>No More Vanishing Acts</strong><br>
Resolved a small spot in Sapienza where objects could fall through the floor when thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Nothing</strong><br>
Eliminated an invisible obstacle in Sapienza. Even the legendary Agent 47 can’t blend into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>When Hitmen Fly</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza that caused 47 to fall when climbing through a specific window in the Town Hall, above Bravuomo’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Map</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the camera could go out-of-world near the tunnel to the Coca Fields in Santa Fortuna.</p>
<p><strong>Boxed In</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Mumbai where subduing the guard leaning on a wooden crate in the Construction Site caused Agent 47 to clip into it.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Drop</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Whittleton Creek where dumping a body over the railing in the garden of certain houses gave two conflicting prompts that could lead to incorrect animations.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Disposal</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Haven Island where Agent 47 could get stuck when dumping a body into the water near the villa’s main entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Laser Reactivation</strong><br>
Fixed a bug in Berlin where taking items from the briefcase caused the laser tripwires placed on the Radio Tower to turn back on after being disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Unseen, but Not Unbreakable</strong><br>
Removed some invisible collision in Chongqing found in The Block</p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unbuttered Blades</strong><br>
Fixed a bug that left a knife lodged in a toaster in an apartment in Sapienza. 47 prefers his tools sharp, not toasted.</p>
<p><strong>Knock, Knock</strong><br>
Corrected the issue in Santa Fortuna where using gate knocker at Rico’s compound while an NPC opens the door causes it to start floating.</p>
<p><strong>No More Surprise Cactus</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Whittleton Creek where a cactus would suddenly appear inside another plant in Helen’s room.</p>
<p><strong>Telepathic Construction</strong><br>
Resolved an issue in Chongqing where the crane near The Block was not properly aligned with the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CHARACTER ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fool’s Gold</strong><br>
Fixed the waistcoat of The Devil’s Own so it is the proper golden color instead of white.</p>
<p><strong>A Perfect Fit</strong><br>
Corrected the visual issue with Murillo’s security guard disguise, where the loose jacket created the illusion of a bulkier Agent 47.</p>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case Closed</strong><br>
Fixed an issue where the prompt for a silent attack displayed as “Eliminate” when Agent 47 carried had the camera and a briefcase equipped, even though the action only pacified NPCs.</p>
<p><strong>Handle with Care</strong><br>
Resolved an issue where a crash could occur when picking up a remote-triggered item.</p>
<p><strong>My Precious</strong><br>
Resolved a bug preventing the “Golden Wrench” from being placed on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Sharp End Forward</strong><br>
Fixed an issue where “The Cat’s Claw” melee weapon would stick into NPCs with the hilt when thrown, instead of the blade.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanup Crew</strong><br>
Corrected a bug that prevented Suspects from being “cleaned up” with shredders or incinerators.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Reaction</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in alerted Syndicate Takedowns and Showdowns, where the Targets/Suspects didn’t enforce Agent 47 until he changed disguise or started trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe Adjusted</strong><br>
We’ve corrected poison crafting in the Safehouse Shed. Only the “Poisonous (Emetic) Mushroom” may be used now, as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Echo</strong><br>
Resolved a bug where Le Chiffre’s poison effect carried over into other missions, slowing dialogue until the game was relaunched.</p>
<p><strong>Out of Place</strong><br>
Corrected a bug in Dubai where taking down an NPC from cover behind a locker in the changing room caused Agent 47 to clip into a linen basket.</p>
<p><strong>UI</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Certain Something</strong><br>
Corrected the English description of the Purple Fiber Wire the phrase now properly reads “<em>Je ne sais quoi”</em> instead of the incorrect “Che nes cet quoi”.</p>
<p><strong>Lost in Translation</strong><br>
Corrected previously missing or incorrect translations; they are now properly translated and transcribed.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Briefing</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Final Test where overlapping text could appear after loading a save with a mission story being tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Details Restored</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in the planning menu where showing details of agency pickups unlocked by default displayed no image in the popup.</p>
<p><strong>Elusive, but Not <em>That</em> Elusive</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where Year One Elusive Targets failed to display in the Career tab.</p>
<p><strong>Learning the Hard Way</strong><br>
Addressed a bug where choosing the “How to Play” video in the Freelancer menu could cause the game to crash.</p>
<p><strong>Typographical Errors</strong><br>
Fixed various typos found in the subtitles for dialogue in The Banker.</p>
<p><strong>PLATFORM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deal in Silence</strong><br>
Resolved an issue on PS5 and Switch 2 where some sounds were inaudible, most notably in Freelancer when gaining or losing Merces (e.g. when buying from Suppliers).</p>
<p><strong>Trust Your Instincts (Once Again)</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on PS4 and PS5 where, under certain circumstances, Targets and Suspects failed to appear in instinct.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Grace</strong><br>
We’ve (hopefully) fixed the infamous “PS5 saving bug” where the saving icon can appear and then refuse to disappear indefinitely. Thanks for your patience, Agents.</p>
<p><strong>Clearer View</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on PC where the “Adaptive SuperSampling Techniques” option was not visible in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Clone Mix-Up</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on Epic Games where The Splitter Pack DLC appeared under the wrong name and without an image in the installed content list.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing is Caring</strong><br>
Resolved a bug on Steam preventing The Banker Pack DLC from supporting refunds or family share.</p>
<p><strong>Vacation Restored</strong><br>
Corrected an issue preventing Sapienza missions from being accessed offline on Epic Games.</p>
<p><strong>Confusion Controls</strong><br>
Fixed an issue on iOS where the analog stick could show when using certain set-pieces that didn’t require it.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Marksman</strong><br>
Fixed an issue on iOS where it was not possible to activate the marksman trait when using touch controls</p>
<p><strong>Limber Up</strong><br>

<p>Below is a list of known issues that have been identified by the team who are working on fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When travelling to specific locations within Freelancer (currently we’ve only identified a certain spawn in Berlin as having this issue) with a large illegal item, it’s possible for the briefcase to spawn incorrectly, causing it and the item inside to be lost or otherwise inaccessible.
<ul>
<li>We’ve found that repeatedly pausing and unpausing the game for the first few seconds of the intro cutscene can prevent this issue from occurring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In “The Infiltrator” and “The Dragon”, when Bruce Lee is fighting, it’s possible for the fighters to get stuck under specific circumstances, blocking progression of the mission.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-awaited Mega Evolution era has finally arrived in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> following the Japanese releases of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia</a> in August 2025. With their towering HP values, spectacular full-art designs, and that notorious 3-Prize rule when a Mega ex is knocked out, these cards are already shaking up both the collector market and early deck-building experiments in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-has-so-much-pokmon-stuff-its-almost-unfair">Japan</a>, and we expect the same to happen worldwide, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like every major set, certain chase cards have risen to the top. That’s whether for playability, stunning artwork, or simply the popularity of their featured trainer or Pokémon. Below, we’ve ranked ten of the most expensive Mega Evolution cards in today’s market on our favourite dedicated marketplace, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, starting from the lowest on the chart and working up to the crown jewel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia expansions have already delivered some of the most eye-catching and valuable cards of the year, with the 10 most valuable of which from the combined Mega Evolution set can be found below, for those who don’t feel like scrolling through the whole larger list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with the set only just being released, TCGplayer's exact most valuable card rankings are changing rapidly, due to continuous market price changes. So, be sure to also check out the live page showing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most expensive Mega Evolution Pokémon cards on TCGplayer</a> right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, as for our top 10, from dazzling behemoths like Mega Venusaur ex and Mega Gardevoir ex, to nostalgic Special Art Rares of fan-favourite trainers like Lillie’s Determination, collectors are still scrambling to secure them before prices climb higher. Here’s a quick look at the ten of the most expensive cards currently dominating the Mega Evolution market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228417"><div id="228417" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Venusaur ex cards in general thrive on endurance, and Mega Evolution's is no different. Solar Transfer lets you freely move Grass Energy around, while Jungle Dump delivers 240 damage and heals 30, making it tough to topple. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">5ban Graphics’ artwork reinforces that bulk, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMyRZ?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> crouched under vibrant petals in a pose that radiates raw power. Both a sturdy option in Grass decks and a visually commanding card, it’s a sought-after Ultra Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. <strong>Mega Absol ex – 161/132 (Ultra Rare)</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228412"><div id="228412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 161/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Absol has always had a cult following since its debut in Gen III , and this new Mega form captures that same aura of menace. <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3wk0?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Absol Ex's</a> Ultra Rare gives us an eye-catching, almost gothic rendering, making it look like it has stepped out of a noir film, with its mix of black and yellow tones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitively, its Terminal Period attack is an intriguing win-condition attack, knocking out foes that line up perfectly on damage counters, while Claw of Darkness offers raw power plus disruption. Though it’s a little clunky in the current fast-paced meta, Absol’s fan appeal ensures this one holds value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Vulpix – 138/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228413"><div id="228413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vulpix - 138/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMD5o?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vulpix</a> won’t shake the meta with Stampede and Combustion, which are serviceable but underpowered. What makes this card stand out is its Illustration Rare art by saino misaki, showing the fox Pokémon curled up by a fireplace in a warmly lit, rustic room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a cosy-looking slice-of-life card that collectors are eager to chase, proving once again that atmosphere and nostalgia can lift even a low-power card into a high-value slot.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Marshadow – 146/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228414"><div id="228414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marshadow - 146/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marshadow is one of the more competitively promising Illustration Rares. Shadowy Side Kick deals respectable damage, and its effect of blanking damage to <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PO01?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marshadow</a> on the following turn if it takes a KO can stall opponents effectively. Altogether, this card straddles the line between competitive tech and collector gem.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Bulbasaur – 133/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228416"><div id="228416" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Already a major seller amongst Pokémon TCG collectors on TCG player, this Mega Evolution <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeK1D5?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur’s</a> Bind Down is a deceptively disruptive move, trapping your opponent’s Active Pokémon in place while chipping away at their board state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This utility, combined with Bulbasaur’s nostalgic allure as the original Grass starter, gives it both competitive and casual appeal. Artist mashu delivers bold, swirling colours that make Bulbasaur appear almost dreamlike, enhancing its chase factor. Along with being playable, it’s one of the most visually striking cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lillie’s Determination – 169/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228415"><div id="228415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 169/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not as dazzling as its more artistic counterpart below, this UR of <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrJNG?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie's Determination</a> is already one of the hottest chase cards of the Pokémon TCG’s Mega Evolution set. Atsushi Furusawa’s stunning full-art design captures Lillie with delicate, vibrant detail, and the card effect remains a flexible draw option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may not dominate the competitive scene, it is almost guaranteed to headline binders and display cases. It can be easy for newcomers to underestimate Lillie’s immense popularity, but that doesn’t stop its position near the very top of the set’s value list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Ivysaur – 134/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228418"><div id="228418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 134/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Razor Leaf offers a reliable 60 damage for two Grass Energy, positioning <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4PYR?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a> as a useful bridge to Mega Venusaur in dedicated Grass decks. The artwork, again by mashu, captures Ivysaur leaping forward with fierce determination against a backdrop of glowing foliage and vibrant petals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the full Kanto starter line, collectors are eager to build the evolutionary trio, and its combination of steady damage and stunning visuals cements its rising market value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mega Venusaur ex – 177/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228421"><div id="228421" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our third-most valuable card in the Pokémon Trading Card Game’s new Mega Evolution set, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgwoD?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> is a true battlefield tank, with Solar Transfer enabling seamless Energy redistribution and Jungle Dump delivering 240 damage while healing itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, this makes it one of the most flexible and durable attackers in the set. The SAR artwork by mashu is extraordinary, depicting a lush, chaotic jungle scene bursting with colour, where Venusaur looms as a dominant presence. The synergy of competitive utility and jaw-dropping art is what has pushed this card into the top tier of value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Lillie’s Determination – 184/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228419"><div id="228419" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 184/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Few Trainers hold the same sway in the secondary market as Lillie. Not only does the floral artwork of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqm4j?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a> by Atsushi Furusawa give off endless warmth and nostalgia, the actual effect of this Trainer card is great as well: refreshing your hand with seven new cards or even eight when behind, presenting real utility in control and comeback strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top, Lillie’s sheer popularity, though seems to be additionally driving the price tag into the around-$200 stratosphere, just as we’ve seen with her earlier Sun &amp; Moon prints.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228420"><div id="228420" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Priced at over $500 at the time of writing, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31qeq?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex</a> stands as the Pokémon TCG's crown jewel of the Mega Evolution set. Whilst Overflowing Wishes accelerates Psychic Energy across your Bench, Mega Symphonia converts that fuel into devastating damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raita Kazama’s museum-quality artwork, full of pastel tones and floral elegance, perfectly matches the card’s grace and strength. It’s this union of competitive power and striking style that cements this beautiful piece of cardboard as the set’s most coveted prize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

Here's a look at all the content in the Nioh 3 Digital Deluxe Edition</p><ul><li>Nioh 3 base game</li><li>Nioh 3 Season Pass (unlocks two post-launch DLCs)</li><li>Chijiko Netsuke Charm accessory</li><li>Kodama Netsuke Charm accessory</li><li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li><li>Early Purchase Bonus: Hellfrost Warrior Attire, Hellfrost Ninja Attire (purchase by February 19)</li><li>Digital Preorder Bonus: Hellfire Warrior Attire, Hellfire Ninja Attire, Scampuss Furball Netsuke charm (purchase before February 6)</li></ul><p>Preorders are available on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014010/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> and on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><hr><p>Like the previous entries, Nioh 3 is a fast-paced third-person action RPG that moves quicker than most souls-likes. Playing as Tokugawa--whose appearance is fully customizable--you’ll fight the Yokai plaguing the land in intense combat. The main twist this time is the choice between two distinct combat styles: Samurai or Ninja. With the Samurai style, you can perform a "Ki Pulse" to regain stamina after a combo and build up an Arts Proficiency gauge that unleashes powerful finishing attacks. A new parry system has also been introduced to the gameplay.</p><p>Opting for the Ninja path grants agile, evasive techniques and faster strikes. Instead of weapon stances, you'll wield ninja tools alongside unique abilities. Mist, for instance, creates a clone that distracts enemies, while swift dashes let you slip behind foes for lethal backstabs. Each style has its own gear, but you can switch between them on the fly to adapt in battle. Returning mechanics include guardian spirit transformations, Soul Cores, and Yokai abilities. Set in a “dark samurai world” teeming with sinister spirits, your journey will uncover hidden secrets as you march toward the calamity known as the Crucible.</p><p>If you'd like to catch up on the previous Nioh games, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nioh-Collection-PlayStation-5/dp/B08NX8F4W1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get both of them in a bundle deal</a> for $34.80 (was $70) on PS5.

                <p>Last year's Fortnitemares was extremely packed with microtransactions, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> item shop averaging a new collab skin every other day over the course of October. And it may be that Fortnitemares 2025 will be even more crowded, with long-rumored collabs with Scream, Friday the 13th, and Scooby-Doo expected to appear in the Fortnite shop during spooky season. But now there's a new rumor about yet another Fortnitemares collab--KPop Demon Hunters.</p><p>The exact nature of the Fortnite x KPOP Demon Hunters collab isn't clear at all right now, since the entire leak is just <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1971637158617534758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HypeX saying</a> that it's "the main Halloween collab" and that it's "not just skins." If true, this would presumably mean that there will be some new KPop Demon Hunters-related gameplay mechanic, like a new weapon or other item. Though since Fortnitemares is also rumored to have a Jason Voorhees medallion and Ghostface's mythic knife, the KPop Demon Hunters collab would have to be even more involved with that.</p><p>The new season of Fortnite Festival begins on October 9, and so it's possible that HUNTR/X will be the new season headliners. Epic previously promised the upcoming Festival season would be focused on Fortnite-original stuff, but that just means they had a plan that would have been very easy to pivot away from if they had the chance to swap in a collab with the biggest Netflix movie ever.</p><p>Fortnitemares 2025 is expected to start in early October, but we don't know for sure when it will be just yet. Even so, there have been plenty of leaks about what we can expect to see from this year's spooky festivities, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">you can read all about them here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MagicCon Atlanta just kicked off and with it, the roadmap for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in 2026. It includes seven sets and more branded crossovers than you can shake a Black Lotus at. If you thought this year was overstuffed, just wait. From Lorwyn and <em>Star Trek</em> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and Dwight from<em> The Office</em>, Wizards of the Coast is ready to take everything in your wallet, and your sanity, too.</p> <h2 id="lorwyn-eclipsed-january-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed – January 23, 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629342">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s been 18 years since players visited Lorwyn, the idyllic land of whimsical creatures like elves and merfolk. Lorwyn Eclipsed is one of the most-anticipated authentic MTG sets in years, with old mechanics returning to the spotlight and players getting to go back to where Planeswalkers were first introduced. I can’t believe it’s been that long. I still remember drafting my first Jace Beleren in college.</p> <h2>Mystery Universes Beyond set – 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629355">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wizards of the Coast teased a mystery set it’s not ready to fully reveal yet. More details are coming during New York Comicon in October where, as others have noted, there’s a <em>Magic</em> and Nickelodeon panel planned. Are we getting <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>? <em>Rugrats</em>? <em>Hey Arnold</em>? All of the above?!</p>

 <h2 id="secrets-of-strixhaven-april-2026">Secrets of Strixhaven – April 2026</h2>  <figure id="attachment_2000629341" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629341"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629341">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>School is back in session. Secrets of Strixhaven will take players back to the plane of&nbsp;Arcavios where colleges of sorcerers-in-training compete for bragging rights in the Mage Tower. It’s Wizards’ knock-off of <em>Harry Potter</em> and we’ll find more about what its next set has in store in early 2026.</p>

 <h2 id="marvel-super-heroes-june-2026">Marvel Super Heroes – June 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629344"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629344">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>If any of the sets can rival the dominance <em>Final Fantasy </em>had this past summer, it’s this one. It’ll draw from characters across the Marvel universe, meaning Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and more. There will also be all the villains to account for. I’d have preferred <em>just</em> an X-Men set, personally. There’s way too much material to speed through in one set. But here we are.</p>

 <h2 id="the-hobbit-august-2026">The Hobbit – August 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629346"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629346">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>A return to Tolkien’s world of hobbits, wizards, and dragons is on the way. The <em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>set was the first <em>MTG</em> Universes Beyond release to make a big splash. This set will be heading back to the prequel book and pulling from an earlier part of the Third Age. Will there be <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-lotr-mtg-tcg-one-ring-card-price-1850596616">another One Ring card</a>&nbsp;to rule them all this time around?</p>

 <h2 id="reality-fracture-october-2026">Reality Fracture – October 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629347"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629347">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wizards has been setting up Reality Fracture as a big comic-book-style event that will reverberate across its multiverse. We have no idea what to expect really, but the company is teasing “a villain you’ll have to see to believe.” Is it the friends we made along the way?</p>

 <h2 id="star-trek-november-2026">Star Trek – November 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629348"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629348">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-trek-tng-enterprise-price-release-date-2000624069">First Lego</a>, now <em>MTG</em>. I’m embarrassed about how much money I’m about to drop chasing a surge foil full alt art Jean-Luc Picard commander card. The set will feature characters and ships from across the entire franchise. I can’t wait to make a Borg deck.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x PlayStation<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Superdrop</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629365"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629365">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Secret Lair drops are always a mess and I’m guessing this one won’t be any different. Who’s ready to spend 45 minutes in an online queue only for Wizards to sell out and refuse to let you give it $100 at the end? The Kratos art looks incredible though.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Jaws: Terror of Amity Island</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629366"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629366">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s the rest of the Secret Lair drop announcements, and somehow Jaws <em>isn’t </em>the weirdest one<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Secret Lair x The Office: Dwight’s Destiny</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629369">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><em>The Office</em> was a funny show and the world is never gonna let us forget it.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Iron Maiden: Album Art</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629363">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>I defer to the Iron Maiden x <em>MTG</em> fans on this.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Iron Maiden: Eddie Unchained</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629358"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629358">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>See above.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Furby: Doo-ay Noo-lah</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629362">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wut?</p>  <figure id="attachment_2000629361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629361"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629361">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>???</p> <h2><em>Secret Lair x Furby: The OddBodies</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629359"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629359">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Absolutely not.</p>

          <p>Video game mega-publisher Electronic Arts is planning to take the company private in a deal that could be worth as much as $50 billion, according to reports from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, and <a>Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>All three outlets cite anonymous sources in reporting that the deal could be announced next week, with Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners reportedly interested in investing. The Wall Street Journal says the move "would likely be the largest leveraged buyout ever."</p>
<p>The Saudi PIF already had a roughly 9 percent stake in EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-to-transfer-its-gaming-stock-to-savvy-games-group">as of a year ago</a>, making it one of the largest shareholders in the company. That fund also has significant investments in gaming giants such as Nintendo, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Capcom, Nexon, and Koei Tecmo managed through the Savvy Games Group.</p>
<p>EA's stock price immediately jumped roughly 15 percent on Friday afternoon, following a month in which its stock price had remained relatively flat.</p>
<p>EA went public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1990, and by 1996 its market cap had risen to $1.61 billion. Before today's stock price bump, the company's valuation was hovering around $43 billion, driven by franchises such as <em>Madden NFL</em>, <em>EA FC</em> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/ea-friendship-ended-with-fifa-now-ea-sports-fc-is-my-best-friend/">formerly <em>FIFA</em></a>), <em>The Sims</em>, and <em>Battlefield</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts is reportedly near a deal that would take the company off the stock market and into the land of private companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Videogame Giant Electronic Arts Nears Roughly $50 Billion Deal to Go Private">Wall Street Journal </a>earlier today, this deal would apparently have a group of investors which includes Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The value would be as much as $50 Billion, and it would be a leveraged buyout, meaning that EA's own assets would serve as collateral for the debt that would be used to make the purchase.</p>

<p>The Public Investment Fund is already one of the biggest shareholders in Electronic Arts, and also own part of Affinity Partners, seemingly placing them as the main power brokers in the ownership structure going forward if the deal goes through, which could be as early as next week.</p>

<p>This follows a period where Electronic Arts has had mixed results from financial perspectives, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-q3-results-not-the-financial-performance-we-wanted-or-expected" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="EA Q3 results &quot;not the financial performance we wanted or expected&quot;">under performance of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>&nbsp;in the third quarter</a> of fiscal year 2024-2025 fulled by a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-q4-results-exceed-expectations-culminating-in-strong-finish-to-full-year-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="EA Q4 results exceed expectations, culminating in &quot;strong finish&quot; to full-year results">stronger finish to the fiscal year</a> driven by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Split Fiction Review - Everything Everywhere"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>.</p>

<p>If the deal were to go through, it could mark the largest leveraged buyout in history, and an exceptionally large deal in general. It definitely raises comparisons to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Buys Activision Blizzard, Bobby Kotick Staying As CEO">Microsoft purchase of Activision Blizzard</a>, a deal which has had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-fires-back-at-ftcs-accusation-on-layoffs-in-activision-blizzard-legal-battle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Fires Back at FTC's Accusation on Layoffs in Activision Blizzard Legal Battle">absolutely no problems at all</a>.</p>

<p>The news is emerging as EA is preparing for one of its biggest releases of the year with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Preview - All-Out-Warfare in Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm"><em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a>&nbsp;which has been well received by players early on, following a rough previous release in the series. Looming over the deal also is the specter of artificial intelligence and many firms talking about the ability to downsize with making use of generative artificial intelligence, and the fact that leveraged buyouts often are followed by large cost cutting.</p>

               <p><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>has become the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>of trading card games, and as annoying as I find the practice of constantly dumping different IPs together, even God’s strongest soldiers are not immune to propaganda. At MagicCon Atlanta, Wizards of the Coast and Sony announced that </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/26/first-in-depth-look-at-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-x-playstation-collaboration-launching-this-october/"><span>PlayStation series are getting seven different Secret Lair drops</span></a><span> for various games, and folks, I want those</span><i><span> Last of Us </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>On October 27, Wizards of the Coast will be selling seven PlayStation sets, with most of them covering different franchises in the console maker’s catalog. However, both </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>are getting two sets. The former will have a pair of cards for both the first game and its sequel, while the latter will cover both the original Greek storyline and the reboot’s Norse one. With the exception of the </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> sets, most of these drops just seem to feature one card with their respective games’ protagonists. The set will drop at 9 a.m. Pacific Time that Monday.</span></p> <p><span>The full line-up includes:</span></p> <ul> <li><i><span>The Last of Us Part I</span></i></li> <li><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Uncharted</span></i></li> <li><i><span>God of War: Greek</span></i></li> <li><i><span>God of War: Norse</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i></li> </ul> <p><span>Though it’s not surprising that Sony would want to spotlight its current stable of prestige action games, I’m bummed there’s not more classic PlayStation representation here. Give me Parappa the Rapper, you cowards. But that’s pretty par for the course these days with Sony. Even its upcoming concert series is leaning heavily into its new stuff.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I don’t play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, but I did buy the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cards they put out earlier this year just to get the Shadow the Hedgehog one. He’s sitting pretty on my shelf, so I guess I’ll also buy the </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>ones next month, to keep him company. You know, as long as they don’t sell out before it’s my turn in the queue.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Legendary survival horror series <i>Silent Hill</i> has entered a new era this week with the arrival of <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">the highly anticipated <i>Silent Hill f</i></a>. <i>f</i> aims to deliver <i>Silent Hill</i>’s themes of dreadful, psychological horror in a brand new setting, featuring new characters and a new combat system.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The combat here is a little more action-focused than in previous entries in the series, though the game still manages to feel dangerous at every turn. And while I had a delightfully macabre time with this elegant survival horror game, there were a few things I wish I’d known before jumping in. So, after spending tens of hours on this game in both Story and Hard mode, allow me to share with you what I learned while surviving the fog.</p> <hr> <h2>1. Don’t sleep on omamori</h2> <p><i>f</i> may be a survival horror game, but it’s got a touch more build-crafting than you might expect. Not only can you improve Hinako’s max health, stamina, and sanity, you can also equip omamori to augment her abilities. You can increase the maximum amount of omamori slots by spending enough faith at shrines.</p>

 <p>While you might be better off investing faith in improving your stamina first, you should still be regularly checking which omamori you’ve collected thus far to see where you can gently improve your combat skills. Plus, unlocking an extra omamori slot can be really advantageous.</p>

 <hr> <h2>2. Stop hanging onto those offerings</h2> <p>As you traverse the weird and terrifying world of <i>Silent Hill f</i>, you’ll find various offerings like antique combs and dried carcasses. These items have no utility beyond earning faith by offering them up at a shrine. But they do take up inventory space. On more than a few occasions, I found my inventory full only to see that there was some random offering I picked up a while back still taking up space, doing nothing but inconvenience me.</p>

 <p>Check your inventory for offerings every time you’re at a shrine and you’ll have a lot more room to spare.</p> <hr> <h2>3. Invest in Stamina first, Sanity second</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629310">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Stamina is Hinako’s super power. No, really! While our girl is plenty capable of bashing in a monster with a steel pipe, weapons break pretty quickly and there are more than a few occasions when you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. You’ll need to be able to deftly get in and out of skirmishes with the creatures of the fog. For this reason, I recommend investing in improving your stamina first, followed by sanity second.</p>

 <p>Sanity is what will allow you to pull off a pretty powerful counter attack, as well as Hinako’s charged light melee strike (this ability isn’t available at first).</p> <p>Having a generous amount of stamina to maneuver out of the way of enemies, and enough sanity to deliver more powerful strikes, will help you get hit less and ensure enemies go down faster.</p>

 <hr> <h2>4. Don’t get into useless fights</h2> <p>The creatures of the fog might be creepy, but you’ll quickly realize that many of them are pretty easy to take out–especially if you’re used to combat-focused games like <i>Dark Souls</i>. That said, resist the urge to go wild and clear the town of monsters. While your weapons in the Dark Shrine segments of the game won’t break, the random pipes, crowbars, and kitchen knives you’ll pick up in Ebisugaoka are fragile little things and you can easily find yourself without a weapon all too easily.</p> <p>Hinako can’t punch or kick, so if you’re without a weapon, you will have no offensive options against monsters. No bueno. Pick your battles strategically.</p> <hr> <h2>5. Higashi is kinda broken</h2> <p>Early on, I neglected eating any Higashi, which restores your stamina, because managing stamina seemed like a me-problem more than anything else. That was until I got to hard mode and had to take on one of the game’s early bosses and, well, I learned that this item is kinda broken.</p>

 <p>Not only will eating it replenish your stamina, but you’ll have unlimited stamina after eating for a rather generous amount of time. This provides a perfect opportunity to spam your dodge while also getting in close to deliver a ton of hits without worrying about your stamina.</p> <hr> <h2>6. Keep your distance and use the camera to peer around corners before exposing yourself</h2> <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> is pretty low on jump scares. But there are more than a few occasions in which monsters are eager to hop out from a hiding spot and attack you. When this happens, it’s more than likely that you’ll get pulled into a grab animation where the camera will zoom up to show the monster brutally attacking Hinako.</p>

 <p>There’s no way out of this animation once it starts. Mash all the buttons you want, you’re not getting out of it without losing a chunk of your health. So in general, it’s best to try and leave some distance between you and any monster you happen to be fighting.</p> <p>One way to do that is to use the third-person camera to peer around a corner where you suspect a monster may be hiding. The game will play some gentle static (though it sounds a little more like a record player looping on silence in this game) when a monster is nearby, so trust your eyes and ears to avoid unnecessary damage.</p> <hr> <h2>7. Counter attacks get easier once you unlock Hinako’s charged-up attack</h2> <p><i>Silent Hill</i> <i>f</i>’s counter-attack can be a little challenging to pull off at first. You have to wait for the monster to flash in color, then hold down focus, then execute a heavy attack. Given that focusing drains your sanity meter pretty quickly, countering an enemy can be a weird, time-sensitive juggling act.</p>

 <p>That said, once you unlock Hinako’s charged-up light attack, things get a little easier.</p> <p>Since you have to hold down your focus button anyway to charge up your light attack, it has the added benefit of putting you in a good place to successfully pull off a counter-attack. While you’re waiting for Hinako’s attack to charge up, keep your eyes on the enemy. If they flash in color, forget the light attack and immediately hit your heavy attack button. Since you’re holding down your focus button, you’ll trigger the counter attack.</p> <hr> <h2>8. Nail that perfect dodge</h2> <p>Dodge just before an enemy strikes you, and Hinako will hack the foggy Matrix to slow down time and recharge her stamina instantly. It’s a pretty small window, but nailing this move is pretty essential for surviving the game’s tougher enemies. Hinako runs out of stamina pretty fast, so do everything you can to preserve and restore it.</p> <hr> <h2>9. Look out for helpful items during boss fights</h2> <p>Fragile weapons and sparse items can make you feel pretty on edge at times in <i>Silent Hill f</i>, especially during boss encounters. Fortunately, the game wants you to succeed more than you might think. While my first run through “Story” difficulty didn’t have me desperate for healing items, Hard mode is a different matter.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629311">© Screenshot:: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Fortunately, I’ve noticed that it’s pretty common for the game to throw some items your way during boss fights; you just need to keep your eyes peeled in corners and other non-obvious places.</p> <hr> <h2>10. Collect everything; read everything</h2> <p>Us masochists sure do love a game that kicks you when you’re down. But there’s so much more to <i>Silent Hill f</i> than the struggle against the fog’s shambling, knife-wielding monstrosities. Hinako is quite the diligent note-taker and artist, and you are missing out on so, <i>so </i>much if you don’t take the time to read the various character entries and in-game documents. Not only is the art design on-friggin’-point in <i>f</i>, but so much of the game’s wonderful use of metaphor and its dives into Japanese folklore are found in the journal.</p>

 <hr> <h2>11. Resist brute-forcing your way through puzzles</h2> <p>Trying to brute-force your way through most puzzles in <i>SHf</i> is a quick way to sink into some serious ennui. Puzzles in this game often have too many variables for this approach to succeed in a reasonable amount of time, and trying to do so is way more frustrating than just figuring them out as intended.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629312"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629312">© Screenshot:: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the clues in it aren’t always the most obvious, spend some time studying Hinako’s notebook. You can always jump to it while looking at a puzzle via the on-screen prompt in the lower left-hand corner.</p> <hr> <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> won me over with its brutally dark tale first and foremost, but its combat has a satisfying rhythm that settles into place over the course of the game. Hopefully with these tips, you’ll end up with a few less broken weapons and even fewer scars from those mannequin psychopaths.</p>
