		<p>EA has announced that they are sunsetting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, shutting down the game’s servers on 12th January 2026, after which the online-only title will no longer be playable.</p>
<p>In preparation of this, Anthem and premium currency have all been removed from sale.</p>


<p>This comes “After careful consideration” and gives roughly half a year’s notice of the shutdown. The BioWare Team sign off by saying “We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m surprised that EA kept the servers running this long, given how Anthem was one of the most ignominious flops of the past decade.</p>
<p>After a troubled development, Anthem launched on 22nd February 2019 to a generally poor reaction, struggling with performance, bugs, and generally failing to excite in the same way that rivals like Destiny 2 and The Division were managing at the time. The insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/04/bioware-admits-and-pledges-to-address-workplace-issues-after-anthem-expose/">tales of the game’s troubled conception at BioWare</a> emerged immediately, the company retreating into its shell after announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/anthems-roadmap-act-1-delayed/">the Act 1 roadmap had been seriously delayed</a>.</p>

<p>As the continued development of the game was handed over to BioWare Austin, it took half a years before the game’s first event, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/30/anthem-cataclysm-event-revealed-pts-live-next-week-everything-we-know/">Cataclysm</a>, was added, followed by smaller seasonal in-game events. It was clear that something dramatic was needed to revive the game’s fortunes and the hope was that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/10/bioware-reinvent-anthem-ps5-new-seasons-cheap-deal-game-offer-ps4-xb1/">Anthem NEXT</a> could be that, those plans shattered by the slower pace of development through the pandemic in 2020, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/24/anthem-next-cancelled-no-more-updates/">EA eventually pulled the plug in 2021</a> around the game’s second anniversary.</p>
<p>That effectively consigned Anthem to the history books, and it’s hard to believe that many people have been playing at all over the past five years. I’d have totally believed you if you told me that servers were already shut down in 2022 or ’23.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that, if you do want to play a game with some pretty great Iron Man style flying, you’ve still got the rest of this year to do so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Persona5: The Phantom X Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona5-the-phantom-x-review-in-progress.1235565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always been skeptical of Persona spin-offs. How can you twist such rich games into new shapes while maintaining the intricate details that make the series so beloved? Well, when it comes to the most recent addition to the family, Persona5: The Phantom X, the team at Perfect World appear to have done just that – or, at least, that’s how it seems on the surface. With beautifully animated cutscenes and a goosebump-inducing soundtrack, The Phantom X makes it clear early on that it isn’t keen to shake up the Persona formula. What it does do, however, is infuse that already excellent base with the all too familiar premium currencies of a mobile-focused gacha game. I have a more to play before my final review, but no matter how close it comes to recapturing the magic, there’s already a creeping sensation that this walk down memory lane is going to make way for endless grinding eventually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review"><u>Persona 5</u></a> spin-off, The Phantom X doesn’t centre around Joker and his crew – instead, you’ll be playing as a fresh protagonist, Nagisa Kamisiro (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/persona-5-the-phantom-x/P5X_Protagonist_Canon_Name_Explained"><u>though you can still pick your own name</u></a>), in an alternate timeline version of that story. A seemingly average student, Kamasiro’s life changes when an adorable owl called Lufel calls on them to fight back against the misery and hopelessness enveloping the world, and to turn the tables against the great despair that clouds the hearts of the public. Unable to refuse, Kamasiro learns to wield their inner Persona and travels to the shadow world to help clear out the collective unconscious, one monster at a time. If you’ve played Persona 5, you’ll quickly notice that The Phantom X is following its formula beat by beat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To fight off the aforementioned evil, you’ll bounce between beautifully recreated Tokyo neighborhoods and the monster-filled Metaverse, seeking out misbehaving fiends and infiltrating their minds while learning to master the series’ trademark turn-based combat that centers around elemental weaknesses. And because Kamisiro is a teen, you’ll also have to balance studying, part-time work, and home life, too. With all of its obvious derivations, The Phantom X struggles to conjure fresh ideas or immediate excitement in the shadow of a nearly decade-old modus operandi, but it at least manages to successfully clone the Persona formula, and that will be enough for some. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, where the gameplay itself feels overfamiliar, the surrounding cast of characters provides enough mystery and warmth to keep things interesting. Alongside Kamisiro, you’ll meet the baseball-loving Motoha Arai, your husband-obsessed neighbour Kayo Tomiyama, and  adorable schoolmate Tomoko Noge, to name a few. With energetic voice acting to back up their emotive and often humorous dialogue, it’s clear there’s been an effort to give the NPCs a sense of self, or at least the ones I’ve met so far. It didn’t take me long to forge an emotional attachment to them. Morgana’s anthropomorphic owl counterpart, Lufel, is a particular standout, and I am thoroughly enjoying a running gag about their somewhat archaic vocabulary confusing the school-aged NPCs. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Phantom X follows Persona 5's formula beat by beat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll spend most of your days in Kamisiro’s shoes doing time-progressing tasks like studying for school in local cafes, working at the Konbini for cash, and buying groceries that you can use to cook back at your home. I’m still scratching the surface on how integral these side tasks feel in the scope of saving the world, though I’ve been enjoying making shopping lists and gawking at iconic Tokyo landmarks all the same. Particularly, wandering through the bustle of Shibuya Scramble and spotting its famous puppy mascot amongst the beaming electronic signs felt like a wonderful ode to a city I’ve come to love in both real life and games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from being a typical teen, much of your time in The Phantom X is spent in battle, and your combat expeditions launch from the Metaverse app located on Kamisiro’s phone. You can access these challenges anytime from the overworld, but you’ll need to use a naturally refreshing currency called Stamina to reap the rewards. Focusing on the mainline story missions will help keep you on track in terms of difficulty, though you can also explore a variety of combat challenges as you please to stockpile loot and earn experience, too. This is where the first hints of grinding come into focus but, mercifully, the combat in The Phantom X is very moreish and easy to sink time into. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Phantom X bases its combat system on Persona 5, meaning it's turn-based with engaging reactive elements. When you roll up on a baddie, you’ll cycle through your party one member at a time, choosing between melee attacks, ranged attacks, and special Persona abilities. Similar to Pokémon, the enemies you’ll face, as well as the Personas you deploy, all have elemental strengths and weaknesses (like fire or ice) that can be exploited for extra damage. It’s a tried-and-tested system with enough diversity in its moveset to keep battles fresh, and even if you are starting to tire of it, the imagination-stoking enemy designs pull a good amount of weight throughout. What makes Persona combat truly unique, though, is the series’ bold interface design and legendary battle themes. I promise, no matter how many times you’ve already heard Persona 5’s Last Surprise, it just doesn’t get old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, no amount of vocal flair from singer Lyn Inaizumi can make up for the sizable array of gacha systems and currencies you need to balance in The Phantom X. While there are characters and Personas you can unlock through the story, the quickest way to bolster your team is to engage in the lucky dip Contracts menu. In line with most other Gacha games on the market, you can earn the currencies you need to pull by grinding, or cut to the chase and pop in your credit card details to get an instant boost. I’m still only about 10 hours into my playthrough, and I’ve not hit any obvious roadblocks, but I can see them coming. At my current level, I have enough cash to buy health items, as well as a plethora of unique currencies to upgrade my Personas, weapons and more. Plus, when it comes to actually engaging with the gacha spins, I don’t feel like the boost they provide are hugely necessary to my success yet. Inevitably, this won’t last, though, and I can see cash-shaped hurdles on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the inclusion of premium currencies, perhaps my biggest issue with The Phantom X so far is that it feels more like an uncanny reflection of Persona 5, rather than a unique take on its established lore. Other spin-offs like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-review"><u>Persona 5 Tactica</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-strikers-review"><u>Persona 5 Strikers</u></a> feel like strong additions to the series that come at it from a completely different angle, whereas The Phantom X is more of a well-executed imitation. It’s not to say that I’m bored, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed both its combat and getting to know the characters so far. The first few chapters of its story are well-written, appropriately shocking, and do well to hook you into the world. But The Phantom X’s  “do-over” take on the story The Phantom Thieves just isn’t providing a new enough experience to warrant the amount of time (or possibly money) I’ll need to invest to see it through when Persona 5 and its predecessors are readily available and feel far more curated and engaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m mostly enjoying my time with Persona5: The Phantom X so far, there’s still so much to explore before delivering my final review, like investigating the depth of the upgrade systems and the long-term impact of premium currencies as you progress. As a fan of the series, it’s hard to look a gift horse in the mouth when it comes to fresh Persona 5-related content. But as of right now, I’m just unsure about how The Phantom X can deviate enough from the core material to compel me to invest in it long term – only time will tell. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite games set in Japan</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2020, Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët and vice president of editorial and creative services Tommy François <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-senior-ubisoft-executives-step-down-follo/1100-6479604/" data-ref-id="1100-6479604">stepped down from the company following abuse allegations</a>.

Now, the trial is over and Francois and Hascoet have both been convicted alongside another former Ubisoft executive, former games director Guillaume Patrux.</p><p>All three men were sentenced to suspended prison terms for their roles in "enabling a culture of sexual and psychological harassment," as reported by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/french-court-convicts-ex-ubisoft-bosses-for-workplace-harassment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Courthouse News Service</a>. Francois was also convicted of attempted sexual assault and given a three-year suspended sentence. During the trial, it was reported that Francois sexually harassed female and male employees, including attempts to grope their genitals.</p><p>Hascoet was handed a shorter suspended sentence of 18-months, while Patrux was given a 12-month suspended sentence for personally bullying members of his team.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-layoffs-signal-video-game-industry-brain-drain.1235514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The consequences of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox layoffs</a> are still trickling out, with news of canceled games and closed studios only the vaguest outline of the full effects. Among those caught in Microsoft’s latest bad decision are people with a combined over 60 years at the company, and even more years in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s just a handful that are known so far. Zenimax Online Studios president and <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> director Matt Firor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-elder-scrolls-online-director-matt-firor-who-helped-launch-zenimax-online-studios-in-2007-is-leaving-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced he was leaving the company</a> after “more than 18 years.” Firor has been at Zenimax Online since its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-media-announces-establishment-of-online-gaming-division-zenimax-online-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founding in 2007</a>, long before it fell into Microsoft’s clutches in 2021. Before Zenimax, he was one of the founders of Mythic Entertainment and has <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/83290/matt-firor/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game credits</a> going back to the 90s.</p><p>Turn 10 design director Jon Knoles announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346304368750510084/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> that he’d been caught in the layoffs, after 15 years at Xbox working on Forza games. Knoles has been in game development since <a href="https://x.com/jonk1969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1989</a>, and told <a href="https://www.jedinews.com/interviews/articles/shadows-at-25-jon-knoles-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedi News</a> that “I landed my first game development job at Taito Software Inc., working on [1991’s] <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> for the 8-bit Nintendo system.” Knoles went on to work on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/1140/jon-knoles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so many</em></a> Star Wars games, spending <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonknoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 15 years</a> at LucasArts, among other studios.</p><p>At Rare, which saw its in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Everwild</em></a> canceled yesterday, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a> reports that Gregg Mayles is leaving the studio after 35 years. Mayles was working on <em>Everwild</em>, but his career at Rare started with <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/51913/gregg-mayles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> like <em>Donkey Kong Country, Battletoads, </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. He served as creative director on <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, where a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kU27giiEs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">song in the game’s soundtrack</a> is named after him. VGC also reports that executive producer Louise O’Connor will be leaving the studio; O’Connor, who was also working on <em>Everwild</em>, has been with Rare <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louridge/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since 1999</a>.</p><p>The experience and talent Microsoft has just discarded is staggering, and these are only some of the people we know about so far. When Phil Spencer writes in his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff justification</a> that “we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted,” the people he’s speaking of weren’t just foundational to Microsoft, but to some of gaming’s earliest characters, studios, and systems. But in order for Xbox to “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business,” those people now have to be pushed out from the industry they helped create.&nbsp;</p><p>From a hard-hearted business perspective, it makes sense to lose experienced people; they cost a lot of money! They cost a lot of money because they have a lot of experience, experience that doesn’t just contribute to the projects they’re on, but to their less experienced colleagues. This helps those colleagues, in turn, become the kind of experienced game developers Microsoft is willing to be rid of to make the line go up. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/tech/microsoft-layoffs-9000-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader cuts</a> have focused on axing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-layoffs-d1f2de54ebad6f099deac8fbd3375835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managers</a> in a claim toward “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">efficiency</a>,” but how efficient is it to brain drain your company?</p><p>These days, early-career and experienced game developers alike can’t keep their jobs, and up-and-coming developers can’t enter the industry if there’s no jobs available. Game development isn’t alone in this; we’re seeing similar things happen in <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-shield-mini-room-television" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a>, among other fields. What happens to these industries when basically no one can work in them? How does Microsoft, or any company, plan to make the games it claims its layoffs are in service of when <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no one is left to make them</a>? Where do laid-off people go, and what happens when newcomers are competing for a handful of jobs against people with <em>decades</em> of experience? This whole thing sucks.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kenny-omega-aew-wrestling-little-v"><h3>How Kenny Omega’s AEW Wrestling Theme Came To Life</h3></a><p>Ahead of AEW: All In Texas, Little V Mills shares how he came up with “Battle Cry” as Omega’s wrassling anthem

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>BioWare has announced plans to sunset online support for Anthem. On January 12, 2026, the cooperative sci-fi shooter’s servers will be shut down, rendering the online-only title completely unplayable.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">blog post</a>, BioWare states players can no longer purchase Anthem or its premium in-game currency as of today, but they can spend their remaining balance until the game goes offline. Anthem will also be removed from EA Play on August 15. However, those who have already purchased Anthem can still download and play the game until the January 12 shutdown.</p><p>“We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that,” BioWare says in the blog post.</p><p>BioWare also states that it has not laid off any staff as a result of the sunsetting process.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aOGDso1yvM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aOGDso1yvM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news marks the end of a long and tumultuous road for the maligned shooter. First revealed in promising fashion during E3 2017, Anthem centered on players, called Freelancers, suiting up in powerful mech suits called Javelins to defend humanity on a hostile alien world. Up to three players teamed up to tackle missions in an online-only campaign, while improving their Javelin via RPG-style progression. Anthem launched in a deeply flawed state in February 2019, resulting in a tepid reception from critics and players, including a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/anthem/grinding-gears">7 out of 10</a> from <em>Game Informer</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Chief complaints centered on the game's thin content and buggy gameplay, with many players expressing the game felt unfinished. Anthem's troubled development would later be revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">reports</a>, such as how it largely came together during the year before release despite being in formal development since 2012. BioWare bolstered the game with post-launch updates, and in October 2020, it announced a massive overhaul called <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/10/29/anthem-20-update-revealed-possible-no-mans-sky-esque-comeback-if-pulled-off-correctly">Anthem 2.0,</a> designed to dramatically improve the experience. However, this update was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/24/anthem-20-canceled-by-bioware">canceled</a> in February 2021 as BioWare shifted resources towards the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/mass-effect-lives-on-with-bioware-tease-of-liaras-return">next Mass Effect</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Have you kept up with Anthem over the years, or do you plan to dive back in before the servers are shut down? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/anthems-servers-are-shutting-down-in-january-rendering-it-completely-unplayable]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-xbox-invites-developers-to-roundtable-on-ai-tools-for-game-development-while-laying-off-thousands.1235505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laid off 9,000 employees</a> across the entire company yesterday, with an unknown number of those cuts impacting the Xbox and gaming division. Part of these cuts are<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/"> reportedly directly related to Microsoft's push into AI</a>, and some of those impacted by the cuts are speaking out about how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Microsoft is doing its "<em>damndest</em>"</a> to replace people with AI as fast as it can. </p>



<p>You might think, then, that at least for a day, possibly even a few days, Microsoft would post-pone any more pushing of its AI technology into the faces of developers, publicly or privately. Not the case, it would seem, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">Kotaku</a> spotted that Necrosoft Games director, Brandon Sheffield, shared the beginnings of an email he received from Microsoft and ID@Xbox, inviting him to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 where Microsoft will be talking up using "<em>AI in our tools and processes to make the game development and publishing experience more efficient</em>."</p>







<p>Below Sheffield's post, other developers shared their response to getting the same invitation, with Toronto-based developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social/post/3lt36vjygks2t">Benjamin Rivers saying</a> "<em>just get wrecked, mates</em>." Sheffield agreed, "<em>they really should</em>."</p>



<p>While reports of the total layoffs at Microsoft have the number at 9,000, the exact amount of people impacted in the gaming division remains unclear at this time of writing. Meanwhile, these layoffs have left the talented workers and developers out of a job due to poor decisions made by a c-suite of executives who, for some reason still have their jobs, despite the fact that thousands of layoffs is a clear sign they messed up along the way, and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/">pushed out veteran developers</a> who contain a wealth of knowledge that the AI tools Microsoft is pushing cannot hope to replace.</p>



<p>This is just a shot in the dark, but it seems like decisions that don't lead to wasting and mismanaging talent that has been in this industry for years would be the more efficient route towards successful game development, instead of AI tools that have, so far, proven capable costing a lot of money.</p>

Instead of paying for importers and stores' fees from getting this stuff for retail in Japan to get into your hands, you're paying market value for sealed products. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of chase cards in a booster box for Black Bolt and White Flare, specifically one secret rare, full art, hyper rare or alt art alongside 3 art rares. I'm not saying you'll get your money back in card values, but it's fun ripping boosters open. It's the next best option if you're not just buying cards standalone for display.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Black Bolt White Flare Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"> recent preorder restocks</a> for big box retailers such as Walmart, so we'd recomend keeping an eye on these listings to secure your day one sealed product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qmnw3J?object_uuid=7e837d30-3066-4f84-a9b1-fca31b76eb6e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black Bolt</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJBxB?object_uuid=7e837d30-3066-4f84-a9b1-fca31b76eb6e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare</a> sealed products are also on TCGPlayer, although they're all over MSRP which is to be expected on the secondary collectors market right now.

The game will be removed from EA Play on August 15, 2025, but will still be available for download if it's already in your library until it officially shuts down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem launched in February of 2019 to lukewarm reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">including our own 6.5/10</a> which criticized the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and a mismatched story. The game had sold 5 million copies as of December of 2023, which fell short of EA's target of 6 million copies in the first few months. Though EA continued to update and improve Anthem in the months that followed its launch, in February of 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">EA ceased active development on the game</a>.

This will come as a relief, given that EA has undergone a number of massive staffing cuts in the last few years that have left staff reeling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, EA shut down Cliffhanger Games and canceled its in-development Black Panther game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">laying off an unknown number of individuals in the process</a>.

That was all just in 2025. Last year, EA underwent a massive restructuring that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, and the year before that in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">50 individuals were laid off at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number of others were cut at Codemasters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for BioWare, it's currently fully focused on Mass Effect 5 after the sales failure of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<section><p>The new mini battle royale is Fortnite's best mode for players who prefer not to get too sweaty.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's starting to feel a little bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is overrun with different battle royale modes. We already had the standard BR that everyone knows, along with OG and Reload, each with no-build variants. Then, just a few weeks ago, Epic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">tossed in the new mobile-oriented Blitz Royale</a>, a mini battle royale with 32 players, for good measure. Can all these different modes continue to live alongside each other?</p><p dir="ltr">I think they can, so long as they each have a niche they can carve out among the greater Fortnite audience. Regular Battle Royale is the catch-all for general audiences, OG is for the folks who prefer a stable experience that rarely changes in major ways--or just those who have nostalgia for the Fortnite of yesteryear--Reload is for the sweats, and Blitz Royale, though it might seem extremely swift and sweaty at first glance, is actually the more casual alternative to all of those existing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only played Blitz Royale right when it launched, you may not see it. When the mode initially dropped, it was pretty intense and full of sweaty folks, which was to be expected for an entirely new mode that everybody was trying out for the first time. But it didn't take long for things to mellow out as the player count normalized.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Blitz Royale was created to capitalize on Fortnite's return to iPhones in the US, the matches are very short, taking five minutes or less for the winning player or team, and matchmaking has to happen quickly. And with Fortnite, quick matchmaking usually means more bots in place of human players. It's certainly proven to be true with Blitz, which has typically populated my games with what seems to be eight human players alongside a pile of bot players--and that ratio tends to hold up whether I play solo, duos, or four-player squads. I've even had a bunch of squad rounds in which my team never seemed to encounter <em>any </em>human players at all--this has happened about every four or five rounds of Blitz Royale squads that I've played.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not trying to drag the mode over this, though. Most casual players don't care if they're fighting bots or human players, and they definitely aren't playing Fortnite to test their gaming skills against the best opponents available. For most players, the game's mix of skill-based matchmaking and a generous population of bots is the formula for a fun, casual game that's more about TikTok dances than cranking 90s. Likewise, somebody playing Blitz Royale on their phone while they ride the bus to work is probably just looking for a way to pass the time. For these folks, the inclusion of a bunch of bots is not a drawback at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Realistically, too, everything about Blitz Royale that makes it palatable for mobile play--the short matches, the lack of builds, the gimmicky stuff like weekly themed loot pools and medallions--also make it more fun for a casual audience that just wants to pop online and shoot something. You barely have to even do any looting, since Blitz starts you at half shields and will just give you an exotic or mythic weapon a minute or two into the round. With its fast-encroaching storm, small map, and bevy of overpowered weapons that simply appear in your inventory, Blitz Royale is really just Fortnite at its least complicated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526323" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526323"></a><figcaption>The Blitz Knight outfit can be earned in Blitz Royale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And having Blitz as essentially <em>the</em> casual mode makes it easier for the other battle royale modes to cater to a different audience, since they wouldn't need to be as accommodating to every type of player. Reload, in which players will automatically respawn as long as at least one member of their team remains alive, has been a great example of counterprogramming since it launched its new Squid Game-themed map last week. While I've had pretty long matchmaking times for Zero Build Reload matches, often taking more than two minutes to get me a round, the games themselves have been amazing. Just about every round of Reload I've played recently has been a barn burner.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing is, for a game of Fortnite's scale, matchmaking speed is everything. The longer it takes to get a match, says the conventional wisdom, the more likely that a player trained on modern trends of instant gratification will change their mind and not play at all. But with Fortnite now being more of a platform than an individual game, they can mix it up by providing their own alternatives. Don't wanna wait two minutes for a Reload match? Then play Blitz Royale or regular Battle Royale instead. Since Reload's matchmaking times are longer, it's not impossible to imagine that you could pull a win in Blitz Royale before you'd have landed from the bus in Reload.</p><p dir="ltr">With each of these battle royale modes attracting folks from across a spectrum of niches, they can target specific audiences more effectively. If most of the folks who care about matchmaking speed are playing Blitz, for example, then there won't be much need to speed up Reload's matchmaking by adding more bots. It's not splitting the audience so much as it is catering more specifically to the sort of experiences each player is looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands right now, Blitz Royale is slated to only stick around until mid-August. Presuming the player count stays healthy, though, it'll likely return sooner than later, giving more casual players a deceptively laidback mode built for them first and foremost.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anthem-is-going-offline-in-2026-ea-finally-sunsetting-the-failed-live-service-shooter.1235454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Anthem is going offline forever next year, EA and BioWare have announced, as the failed third-person shooter will have its servers shut down on <strong>January 12, 2026</strong>, nearly seven years since it launched in 2019.</p>



<p>You'd be forgiven if you thought Anthem's servers had already been shut down. The response online shows several people expressing surprise that the game is still playable. Even Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo thought the game was six-feet-under by now. </p>



<p>That's not the case though, and in fact, we now know that the chances to play Anthem, should you wish to revisit <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's failed attempt at forcing BioWare</a> to make a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-was-a-key-lesson-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-says-bioware/">the studio even admitted was not its forte</a>, are numbered. </p>



<p>At one point, it looked like Anthem's failure to launch could be salvaged. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/anthem-flying-high-it-doesnt-last/"> release was a mixed bag</a>, to say the least, with some aspects of the game being truly memorable, with most who were around to try it remembering how good the flying mechanics felt. The rest of the game, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-anthem-below-expectations-will-support/">did not reach those same heights</a>, and the extent to which BioWare was out of its element was almost palpable. Still, work was put in to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-2-0-shooting-looting-redesign-more-satisfying/">find a path forward for Anthem</a>, as EA couldn't seem to let it go as easily as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard,</a> for example.</p>



<p>Development on Anthem 2.0 <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/">officially stopped in 2021</a>, and since then, the game has sat on EA's servers, collecting dust, it would seem, until someone found it and was no doubt surprised to find it was still active. </p>



<p>"<em>We have an important update to share regarding Anthem</em>," EA began in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">blog post on the game's official website</a>. "<em>After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026. This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline. We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we'd like to thank you for that.</em>"</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Anthem is playable for another 193 days, to be exact. </p>

        <p>Choose your Stalker—each with their own story, personality, and skills—and descend into the Witch’s cursed dungeon. Enter solo or with trusted companions in teams of up to three.

The Witch’s Curse system dynamically alters dungeon conditions every session, changing the odds—and the challenges.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Armor Destruction System</strong> – As characters take damage, this is represented visually with degraded armor and can be seen by enemy players, adding tension and strategic depth on how and when to engage.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Witch’s Curse System</strong> – The Witch’s Curse changes dungeon conditions multiple times per session. Each 5 minute phase can bestow buffs, debuffs, summon power monsters or change rules on at moment’s notice</li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – Choose between a lighter, fun and casual player-versus-environment experience or hardcore competitive player-versus-environment-versus-player dungeon run modes to suit your style and do so with teammates or solo.</li><li><strong>Play as Unique Stalkers</strong> – Select from a roster of vivid, story-driven characters with diverse abilities and discover the story behind why each of them has found themselves here and unfold the secrets to the dungeon itself!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dungeon-stalkers-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-on-august-13]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Anthem Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Anthem will also be removed from the EA Play playlist on August 15, 2025, and EA says that the sunsetting of the game has not led to any layoffs at developer BioWare. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">Anthem joins a growing number of live-service games that have had the plug pulled on them</a>. Other high-profile games that faced a short shelf-life included Marvel's Avengers, Battleborn, and Super Bomberman R, and in an extreme example, Sony's Concord, which was pulled after a disastrous two weeks.</p><p>Anthem struggled at launch back in 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-anthem-struggled-at-launch-according-to-ea-ceo/1100-6467980/">and according to EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a>, it was because the game attempted to appeal to two different audiences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't just Microsoft that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceling games left and right</a>—according to a <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">report</a> originating from Polish website Pulz Binesu and later <a href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/en-souffrance-techland-annule-deux-jeux-dont-son-action-rpg-de-fantasy-en-monde-ouvert-3050864575.html">reported</a> by Game Kult, Dying Light developer Techland has also recently canceled two of its projects.</p>



<p>Here's what they said in a statement provided to Wccftech:</p>



<p><em>Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline. Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time.</em></p>



<p>Supposedly, one of the canceled games is their upcoming fantasy action RPG based on a new intellectual property. This project has been in the works for at least nine years, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-dev-working-fantasy-title-openworld-rpg-elements-huge-aaa-game/">certified</a> by our coverage from May 2016. The game evidently was put to the back burner as Techland focused on Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but the Polish studio quickly started discussing it after that game launched. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-rpg-first-image-cdpr-veterans/">got</a> the first look at an artwork in May 2022; this title was in development at the Warsaw office, which had been bolstered by former CD Projekt RED developers, and was highly ambitious, according to Techland:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity. </em></p>



<p>Another artwork was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-game-new-concept-art-climbing-huge-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> in May 2023. That was the last we heard about the project. Nothing much is known about the other game. However, the report says that another project has taken their place. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-developer-techland-has-canceled-2-upcoming-games/">Insider </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-developer-techland-has-canceled-2-upcoming-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming</a>, it should be a new Call of Juarez title. As a reminder, the studio regained the rights to the IP from Ubisoft in 2018.</p>



<p>Techland is, of course, also polishing up Dying Light: The Beast, which will be released on August 22 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will get it later in 2025. Check out our hands-on preview and developer Q&amp;A <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this URL</a>.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Online Entertainment chief John Smedley and his new team at Distinct Possibility Studio have unveiled their first game, Reaper Actual. And while some aspects of this first-person shooter may seem very familiar to CoD fans, it's set in a very large-scale persistent online open-world with a map that's bigger than anything in Call of Duty Warfare. Up to 200 players can join a single server in some of the epic battles teased in the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_Jb0jjlS4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XC_Jb0jjlS4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At least for now, Reaper Actual is strictly for PC, and it's essentially the fusion of an MMO and a FPS. The game is set on an island called Marova, which is overrun by rival factions vying for control. As a Reaper, players can sell their services to the various factions on the island, and use all manner of vehicles and weapons to achieve their goals.</p><p>Because the factions are already at odds with each other, the enemy AI characters will wage war with or without players' involvement. Players can choose to take sides or take advantage of the chaos for their own purposes. Players can also create their own bases to defend, and raid the bases that belong to other players or AI. In turn, AI characters and rival players can invade your base as well.</p><p>Control of the island will fluctuate depending upon which factions claim victory in battle. Players can choose to engage each other in PvP fights or to team up and take sides. The game will also feature a crafting system and a player-driven economy for the gear and items that they create.</p><p>Reaper Actual doesn't currently have a release date, but players can <a href="https://reaperactual.firstlook.gg/signup/foundationplayer/eligibility" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for testing at the game's official site</a>.</p>
