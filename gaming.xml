            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Xbox isn't the only company seeing a dip in hardware sales, though.</h2></div><section><p>Xbox hardware sales are way down again in Microsoft's Q4, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year.</p><p>The company posted its earnings today, which included a report of hardware revenue down 42% year-over-year. Hardware sales saw a significant dip of 31% year-over-year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-segment-gets-another-shot-in-the-arm-from-activision-blizzard-in-q3">last quarter as well</a>, though sales were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-earnings-report-activision-blizzard-acquisition">up slightly (3%) in Q2</a> thanks to a series of holiday discounts and promotions. But hardware was also down 7% prior to that in Q1, and yes, <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY23Q4.pptx?version=6e2b873e-6d6a-10c5-ac0b-62f8950909be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping steadily</a> for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-and-sonys-recent-hardware-sales-reports-tell-very-different-stories">several quarters prior to that</a> too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/12/xbox-2-blogroll-1689179393588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox hardware sales are down once again.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For what it's worth, Xbox is far from the only console maker seeing dips in hardware sales. Everyone's impacted, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-drops-the-hardest-as-all-consoles-decline-by-double-digits-compared-to-2023">Circana's most recent report</a>. Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo all say "double-digit percentage declines" in May of 2024, and the Switch saw the most significant drop. This is likely reflective of the fact that all three consoles are on the back halves of their life cycles, and is reflective of fairly normal, cyclical industry trends. Xbox has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">already confirmed that a "next-gen" console is in the works</a>, and has expressed plans to share more information about hardware of some sort around the holiday season.</p><p>Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records. This is largely due to the boost offered by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard - it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up. Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, this indicates that Xbox's not-Activision-Blizzard-related business isn't doing quiiiiite as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Microsoft will hold its Q4 earnings call and field questions from investors and analysts shortly.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news was first reported a<a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1817690782460952651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> few days ago</a> by YouTuber eXtas1s, who previously reported <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1817704919475929442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that Crash Bandicoot N.

Developed by Hangar 13, it is a remake of the 2002 game Mafia. The premise focuses on Tommy Angelo, a former cab driver turned gangster for a crime family in 1930s Illinois. The definitive edition was made from the ground up and features a new game engine, new cutscenes, and tweaks to the gameplay that are similar to Mafia 3. </p><p>In addition to rebuilding the first Mafia game from the ground up, Hangar 13 has taken a point in working on the Mafia series. This includes remastering Mafia 2, which was also released in 2020, and developing Mafia 3 in 2016. In 2022, the studio confirmed it was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-new-mafia-game-confirmed-to-be-in-development">a new Mafia game</a>, though details on the project have remained scarce since the initial announcement back in 2022. </p><p>"Oozing with 1930s atmosphere, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a successful rejuvenation of the best story in the series," my colleague Luke Reilly penned in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-definitive-edition-review">his review</a> of Mafia: Definitive Edition. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“DaFuq has been in touch, all resolved."</h2></div><section><p>A few days ago, a frankly bizarre internet mystery took root: Garry’s Mod creator Garry Newman revealed that the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But since then, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) has said he wasn’t behind the claim, and Newman has told IGN that the manner has been “resolved,” so… all’s well that ends well?</p><p>It all began on Sunday, when Newman posted in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267223128371630282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>S&amp;Box Discord</u></a> server, “you know what's worse than the nintendo dmca?” He then shared the news about the Skibidi Toilet DMCA, including pasting a screenshot of the letter that he was sent. Interestingly, the copyright holder that the letter is attributed to is <a href="https://inviz.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/image-90-1722369935169.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The letter that Newman was sent on behalf of Skibidi Toilet creator DaFuq!?Boom. (Image credit: Garry Newman/Discord)</figcaption></figure></output><p>The letter that Newman posted specifically cites Skibidi Toilet characters like Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they are "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives has indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p>The letter adds that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared in Discord, “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in – you guessed it – Garry’s Mod.</p><p>Gerasimov, however, was quick to attempt to set the record straight. An account claiming to be the YouTube creator <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267632589246697553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote in the S&amp;Box Discord</u></a>, “Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/boom-1722370090490.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Luckily, according to Newman, Gerasimov did indeed find a way to contact him. When reached by IGN via email, Newman confirmed that they were sent the DMCA late last year. “DaFuq has been in touch, all resolved,” he added.</p><p>So, what did happen here? Was it simply a misguided DMCA sent from an overzealous Hollywood production company? It’s unclear as of now, but DMCA claims sent in error certainly aren’t uncommon.</p><p>IGN has reached out to Gerasimov, Valve (which publishes Garry’s Mod), and Invisible Narratives for more clarification. But for now, it looks like this week’s weirdest internet mystery has been resolved. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Minecraft - Tetris DLC Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the trailer, one of the game modes appears to be standard Tetris, but it has a twist. Instead of placing blocks, players are trapped in the area and are forced to mine their way to the top before getting stuck. As for the dungeon crawling mode, it appears that players will eventually be forced to fight a new mob that's made entirely of Tetris blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tetris DLC is out now and costs 1,510 Minecraft Coins (Minecraft's premium currency), which equates to $9.99. Those who purchase it will also get access to new clothes they can equip on their character.</p><p dir="ltr">If you need additional help in Minecraft, check out our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-beacon-in-minecraft/1100-6525031/"> guides on how to make a Beacon</a> and an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-an-anvil-in-minecraft/1100-6524993/"> Anvil</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts.940812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>For the past couple of decades, the official Olympics video games have starred Mario and Sonic and been exclusive to Nintendo devices. Not so, this year. Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is free-to-play and available for PC via the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Hear the curl of the monkey's paw? Yeah, it's a mobile game port with the touchscreen prompts seemingly still intact, and its publisher is also pushing a "commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin collection".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">told Eurogamer</a>, regarding the decision to move the series away from Mario and Sonic. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."
</p>
<p>Cocker was involved with several entries in the series while working at ISM Ltd, a firm responsible for managing the Olympic Games video game license.
</p>
<p>Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is consequently now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/olympics-go-paris-2024-5d5f77">available from the Epic Games Store</a>. It includes 12 mini-games, including sports such as archery, 100m sprint, golf and rowing, and the ability to expand Olympic venues with shops, cafés and upgraded statdiums using unlockables earned via competing in events.
</p>
<p>The game is published by nWay, who also own the license for the official Olympics NFT Digital Pin. "You can claim a legendary or epic pin showcasing the Paris 2024 mascot holding a flag and waving. You can add these digital gems to your collection through Magic Eden's friendly NFT marketplace as part of Coinbase's Onchain Summer event. Be sure to have an ETH L2 Base-supported wallet to secure yours today," says the <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/">Olympics Go! website</a>.
</p>
<p>I have a real fondness for Mario &amp; Sonic At The Olympic Games 2020. Its story mode was dismal, but the many, many sports it featured were mostly fun, and I've played dozens of hours of it with family, up to as recently as a few weeks ago. I'd have probably thrown down £50 to buy a 2024 iteration. It's a shame that I now can't, but also that I can't celebrate an official Olympics game arriving on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase.940809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/">newest game developed</a> by Studio Zero and published by ATLUS. Studio Zero is a division of ATLUS that has developed games such as Catherine: Full Body and now the new exciting addition, Metaphor: ReFantazio, its first game since 2016. ATLUS is the mastermind behind franchises such as Shin Megami Tensei and Persona.</p>
<p>In a brand-new character showcase, players are introduced to some of the rivals and allies they can expect to meet in this new universe. The showcase uploaded to YouTube via Official ATLUS West is 18 minutes long and has a disclaimer that the footage shown is a mixture of in-game footage and footage developed for the sake of a trailer.</p>
<p>The video focuses on the protagonist, a character who is participating in the Royal Tournament but also finds himself at the bottom of the social ladder. The Royal Tournament is an event where all participants vie for kingly power. The protagonist is unlikely to be king simply based on his personality and social status.</p>
<p>In this video, the director Katsura Hashino of Metaphor: ReFantazio introduces some of the characters and explains ways in which the protagonist can increase his favor and popularity with the people. Hashino describes the way that social bonds with specific characters can affect the abilities and archetypes your protagonist will have, which can allow the protagonist to become stronger over time depending on what relationships you choose to build on.</p>
<p>The King is introduced very early into the game, before the protagonist attends his funeral. Once that happens, the King's face appears in the sky, and sets the challenge of winning the most favor in order to become king, in an event called "Tournament for the Throne." To try and gain favor, the candidates have to travel to each major city within the Kingdom to try and win favor from the citizens, and try to prove why they are worthy of being king.</p>
<p>To win favor, they have to compete in challenges. One of these challenges is called the "Exhibition of the Brave" where candidates have to try and bring in the biggest monster head they can. For those who fail, they will be eliminated from the competition, which can include the protagonist if they fail the challenges given to them.</p>
<p>While they haven't given specific dates, there will be more live streams on the ATLUS West YouTube channel where they do further deep dives into the game's development and what players can expect going forward. For now, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3MUxQ5QT5RQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character showcase</a> on their YouTube channel to learn more about the beginnings of the story, and what you can expect from some of the characters in the game.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month it was reported that Skibidi Toilet, the YouTube phenomenon, may be heading to film and television via director Michael Bay. Now Invisible Narratives, a production company co-owned by Bay, has apparently sent a DMCA takedown notice to Garry Newman, citing the large number of Skibidi Toilet games and assets advertised within Garry's Mod.
</p>
<p>Skibidi Toilet uses assets derived from Half-Life 2, however, and owes a lot to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a> machinima scene. And the animation's original creator, best known as DaFuqBoom, is claiming innocence over the DMCA.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Newman shared a screenshot of the alleged DMCA notice on his <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267223543100346369">S&amp;box Discord channel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Significant revenue is being generated by unathorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." The notice goes on to cite characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" as property of the copyright holder Invisible Narratives. "Can you believe the cheek," as Newman noted on Discord.
</p>
<p>If you don't have children or very young teenagers in your life, you might not be familiar with Skibidi Toilet, a series of 3D animations best known for early episodes in which a singing head which emerges from a toilet. If you have seen them, and you're a tired millenial like me, you probably spotted that the head sure looks like a City 17 resident, and the toilet like something you would have fired at a Combine soldier from the tip of your Gravity Gun.</p>
<p>YouTuber Alexey "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsSsgPaZ2GSmO6il8Cb5iGA">DaFuq!?Boom!</a>" Gerasimov, who currently has 43 million subscribers, makes no secret of these inspirations, often crediting Garry's Mod community assets in the video descriptions. Gerasimov also appeared on the S&amp;box Discord after the DMCA began to circulate in the hope of getting in touch with Newman. "I did NOT strike Garry's Mod and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!", he wrote.
</p>
<p>It wouldn't be surprising if lawyers, on behalf of the production company Invisible Narratives, acted without Gerasimov's knowledge. It also wouldn't be a surprise if the entire thing was fake - the DMCA system is ripe for abuse and it wouldn't be the first time Garry's Mod has received takedown notices pretending to be from a company that wasn't at all involved. The typo in "unathorized" doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
</p>
<p>I will make sure to keep on top of the situation and update this story should there be any breaking Skibidi news.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Wildermyth, the acclaimed procedural storytelling RPG from developer Worldwalker Games, is - after three years revelling in its many accolades garnered while exclusive to PC - coming to Switch, PlayStaton, and Xbox on 22nd October this year.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, Wildermyth is pretty familiar stuff, taking players on a fantasy flavoured adventure of party based levelling and tactical turn-based combat. Those bits are all perfectly good, but the real cleverness starts with its procedurally generated story, where campaigns are cunningly, convincingly assembled from beautifully illustrated, wonderfully written narrative fragments and choose-your-own-adventure-style scraps.
</p>
<p>
And <em>that</em> all builds out from your highly customisable party of characters, who each get distinctly defined traits, personalities, histories, and abilities. And each of <em>them</em> can forge alliances, develop rivalries, fall out, fall in love, die and be reborn is a constantly swirling maelstrom of variables that keep things fresh. And that's without factoring in some of other clever stuff, like the way your journey - passing in days, months, and years - unfolds across a dynamic world map that evolves, not always positively, depending on your actions.

It's a real treat - but if you're looking for a more formal recommendation of Wildermyth's brilliance, Christian Donlan called it a "dazzling game of tactics and narrative, choices, and memories" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wildermyth-review-a-proper-rpg-marvel">slapped an Essential badge on it</a> back in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"I love the way Wildermyth embraces huge stretches of time," Christian wrote, "not just the time it takes to build a bridge - tricky if you have to complete a chapter before the summer's gone - but in the way that between chapters of the adventure you earn years of peace, and then you get to see what happens to your players during that peace. By the end of a yarn, you have been through things with these characters, and crucially they have changed. They're older. They've known love and loss. Granted, some of them are now wolves. Some of them even have pets!"
</p>
<p>
Wildermyth for consoles features everything seen on PC - including co-operative multiplayer for up to five friends - alongside a reworked UI designed with gamepad in mind. It'll be available digitally when it comes to Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd October this year, and a physical edition is also in the works for PlayStation and Switch.

It seemed to make all the right moves, using <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> to jump start online multiplayer into the soon-to-be dominant form of gaming, while investing it all back into indie curation, big exclusives, and marketing deal that made the console feel like the place everyone had to be. </p><p>In some ways it felt like the best of all worlds, and by the end of the generation you could pick up an Xbox 360 for just $100 and play dozens of the best games ever made. The culture was far from healthy, and some of the places making everything were a mess to work for. But it was also a fun time, and a weird one. Here’s what we’ll miss about it and why the Xbox 360 still feels so special to us. </p><hr><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842">Let’s remember some Xbox 360s</a></span>! What’s your Xbox 360 origin story Carolyn?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> The first E3 I ever attended was in 2005, with the Xbox 360's launch still some months out and I have to say, the games I saw on the show floor looked amazing. It’s hilarious to me now considering I haven’t even thought about this game in probably 15 years, but at that time, the game that blew me away the most was probably <em>GRAW</em>. Interestingly, though, despite my initial excitement about the console being rooted in its graphical power and my lust for next-gen spectacle, now, when I think back on what made the console so special to me, it’s not really about that aspect of it at all. What about you Alyssa?</p><p><strong>Alyssa Mercante:</strong> I’ve told mine on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://kotaku.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://kotaku.com/" target="_blank">Kotaku.com</a></span> more than once, but I had borrowed my high school sweetheart’s original Xbox to play <em>Halo 2</em> when he went away to college, but not long after that <em>Halo 3</em> came out, which wasn’t backwards compat. So I went out during my free period in high school (we had an open campus for seniors, you could take your car and leave if you didn’t have class), and drove to a Target where I spent my summer job savings on a 360, <em>Halo 3</em>, and Xbox Live. </p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I have zero recollection of the Xbox 360's launch. What was I even doing at the time? 2005. Hmm. I was going into my senior year in high school, barely playing anything except for the occasional late-stage PS2 game—<em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</em>, followed eventually by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>. My only real memory of the beginning of that console cycle is my brother getting a PS3 and me having almost no interest in it. It wasn’t until my girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend in college got me hooked on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> that I finally picked up a super cheap used Xbox 360 arcade edition for like $150. That four years after the console launched but still somehow only the mid-way point.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a1b48d9830f2ccb258bd262ca1b47c8" data-recommend-id="image://0a1b48d9830f2ccb258bd262ca1b47c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1437" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepherd interrogates a suspect.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Yeah, I don’t remember exactly when I finally got one myself—I certainly couldn’t afford one at launch, and my memories of the time around release have a lot to do with playing Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (lol) at GameStop kiosks.<br></p><p><strong>Moises Taveras: </strong>The first time I ever played an Xbox 360 also had to do with <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>. It was all the rage with the kids in my middle school, but I was largely looking from the outside in as a) a PlayStation kid since my youth and b) someone who came from a family too poor to afford more than one console. But eventually, I made friends who had 360s and I remember us all cramming onto a couch in the smallest bedroom imaginable at our friend Howard’s house and playing local multiplayer matches till we lost our voices from shouting. I learned really quickly then that the 360 was synonymous with multiplayer and socializing with folks and it made me want one so bad. Little did I know I wouldn’t get a 360 till the very end of the console generation!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I think part of the Xbox 360's dominance in that era can be attributed to the fact that it offered the best online experience for folks wanting to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, but it also did something incredible that totally won over people like me. I’m not saying I didn’t have an amazing time playing Gears of War co-op, I absolutely did, and huge credit to Microsoft for putting out a steady stream of banger exclusives that really made Xbox Live feel essential. But for me, when I think about the Xbox 360, what still gets me excited most is Xbox Live Arcade, and particularly amazing games like <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em>. Games like this took the arcade leaderboard competition of my childhood and absolutely exploded it. Suddenly I was staying up nights pouring everything I had into beating my friends’ high scores on online leaderboards for all the world to see. Man, it was incredible. </p><p><strong>Moises:</strong> Supergiant Games’ Bastion absolutely blew my mind as far as what I thought games could be. It being a console exclusive to the 360 through XBLA broke my heart and kept me from the portfolio of what’d become my favorite studio, and then Xbox just kept pumping out indie titles like it. Honestly, my working definition of an indie game was largely informed by this era of XBLA games.<br></p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Xbox 360 was the first console launch I was really tuned into the industry for. I was full-blown sicko mode for that thing as a kid, and was counting down the days. I was a huge Rare fan at the time and Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero were a huge deal to me. But broadly, I think I fell off video games for a bit because the system just didn’t speak to my tendencies. As Moises said, the 360 became the multiplayer system and I preferred gaming in solitude, and eventually pivoted to the PS3 in the final years of that generation. But I played the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy on the 360, so I ended up keeping an old 360 in my home longer than any other system. I had to replace the household 360 more times than probably any other system my family owned. </p><p>We got a launch window system that died by the time <em>Halo 3 </em>came out, so we had to replace it swiftly. Then I got my own 360 for Christmas 2009, just before the launch of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. That sucker lasted over a decade. It gathered dust for large swaths of the time, but since I didn’t own an Xbox One, it was the only way for me to go back to my old <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy saves until the Legendary Edition came out in 2021. So while I had mostly abandoned the system by the end of the generation, the 360 is still a defining system in my life because it gave me one of the most important video game experiences of my life. I’ll always be grateful for it, even if I think the Microsoft was a trailblazer for some of the industry’s worst modern tendencies with it.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>That was the other thing that I think tipped me in the direction of the Xbox 360 besides the price and walled multiplayer gardens. As someone coming from the PS1 and PS2, it just had more of the RPGs I was craving earlier or in better condition. I came to the original Mass Effect late but it blew my mind. I got to catch up on Star Wars: The Old Republic. It was synonymous with retro and couch-coop indie games for me like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy. It really did just nail a lot of the same things that the PS4 did a generation later and which ultimately helped Sony to reverse the tide.</p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>it’s so weird to think about now given Xbox’s current situation and catalog, but the 360 was where all the games were!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Another thing that was a big factor for me, I have to admit, is that I was totally cheevo-pilled. The Xbox 360 brought about the advent of achievements and I got extremely excited about pulling off absurd things like beating Call of Duty campaigns on Veteran to get all the achievements. I no longer put much stock in achievements or trophies, but to this day I greatly prefer the at-a-glance number that reflects your achievements compared to all the trophies of PlayStation’s system. And on top of that, the whole interface on Xbox just felt so much more inviting to me than that on Sony. I think avatars were really smart of them to introduce in that era. I loved signing on and seeing little cartoon versions of all my good friends online, playing games of their own. In comparison to that, the whole interface of the PS3 just felt cold and impersonal to me, and that console would end up gathering dust in my entertainment center. </p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>The Xbox 360 home screen definitely felt a lot more inviting and hit that sweet spot of clutter to chill. The controller was also very solid. Have any of you gone back and tried to hold a PS3 DualShock? It feels like you’re being pranked. I take it none of you ever had an issue with red-ringing or other hardware failures?</p><figure id="" data-id="053b350687da112b96f901d6156a7a08" data-recommend-id="image://053b350687da112b96f901d6156a7a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1995" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="People attend a midnight release for Halo 3.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Moises:</strong> Nope! Correct me if I’m wrong but those issues got ironed out with later iterations of the console, so by the time one of my best friends let me indefinitely borrow his 360, it was smooth sailing for me.<br></p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I did have to send mine back for repairs once, and for a while there at least, it felt like everyone I knew who owned one was hitting the red ring. There was a period there, at least in my circle of friends, where there was real disbelief and anger that Microsoft had sold us all a product that was so prone to failure. I think it speaks to just how fond people were overall of the console—its library, its interface, its online features—that today, when you bring it up, you’re far more likely to get fond recollections than bitter complaints. It was so good that even the considerable irritations so many of us experienced with it are now just a footnote in our memories.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>My console ended up red-ringing in like, 2012? But then I read that you can just put it in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to loosen up the glue. Has worked like a charm ever since.</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Wow, I never knew that!</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I think one of the reasons people look back so fondly on the Xbox 360 is that, in retrospect, it felt like the last time you could contain the entirety of what was going on, coming out, and being talked about in your head at any given time. It was still very intimate and physical, with midnight launches and stacks of controllers in the split-screen coop session. There was spectacle with E3 but also the feeling you alone were discovering these incredible hidden treasures on Xbox Live Arcade, which was like a return to finding the internet for the first time again.</p><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> I agree. And they just had so many games that became sensations for a time, from <em>Braid</em> to <em>Geometry Wars</em>. The curation was exceptional, and it was an era in which it still felt like the whole culture, or much of it at least, could still come together for a few weeks around some exciting new downloadable game.</p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>Yeah. By comparison, when the PS4 really started to pivot to those smaller more intimate games early in its lifetime, it wasn’t that those games were lesser, but it did feel like they were being more haphazardly thrown on the platform to fill gaps between big exclusives. Meanwhile XBLA had these clearly thought out rollouts and events that made a big deal of Arcade titles. Also everything was less shitty. Xbox Live Gold was the original multiplayer subscription, and the only one for quite some time, but it at least seemed to provide value with great deals and a platform that produced rock solid multiplayer hits. It also wasn’t as expensive as anything is nowadays.</p><p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Before we wrap things up here, I think we can’t talk about what an amazing console the 360 was without saying a little more about its games. Are there any games y’all want to shout out as particular favorites that really helped make that library great or were emblematic of what the console was doing? When I think about the 360, I think about how the grittiness of <em>Gears of War</em> coexisted harmoniously alongside the whimsy of <em>Viva Pinata</em>, and I’ll never forget the dozens of hours my friends and I spent driving around doing challenges together in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. It really did feel, more than a lot of other consoles, like it offered something for everyone, and like the people behind it thought deeply about how to bring people together to share in the experiences it offered.</p><p> And even though some of its games were also on PlayStation, at least everyone in my friend group, won over by the cheevos and online features of Xbox, always bought multiplatform games there, which perpetuated the console’s dominance in that generation. It’s a little wild to think how this generation it feels somewhat the opposite for me, like most people I know play most multiplatform games on PlayStation. Wild how the tables have turned. But yeah, any other 360 shoutouts? </p><p><strong>Moises: </strong>I cannot separate the 360 from the stunning role it did in promoting so many smaller studios to the mainstream. I already invoked Bastion from Supergiant Games, but I can’t not shoutout Limbo and Playdead, which has now delivered two absolutely singular game experiences in a row. Oh and Shadow Complex does still own.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Limbo </em>was incredible. While the indie darling backlash was fair and warranted, it was really an incredible run of curation there for several years. <em>The Dishwasher</em> games were great, and really spoke to that sense of Newgrounds 2.0 animating the grungy vibe of XBLA. It’s also wild how much Microsoft tried to court Japanese RPG fans with<em> Blue Dragon</em> and<em> Lost Odyssey</em>. For me personally, <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> is still an all-time great. One of the last times I was able to rope friends into playing something for hours with me on a couch.</p><p>I was trying to think of my top five favorite 360 games, exclusive or no, and couldn’t stop listing stuff. The end of that console generation was so strong, on both 360 and PS3, maybe there’s hope that the Series X/S and PS5 pick up in their final years. But with massive budgets, long development times, and so much risk-averse consolidation, I’m not hopeful.</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Whether it picks up to some degree or not, I think it’s safe to say that there will never be an era quite like that exemplified by the 360 again. The console was just perfectly poised to take advantage of a given moment in gaming culture and technology, employing exciting new ideas like achievements to build a sense of both community and friendly competition around games in ways that its library and online service leveraged brilliantly. Also, Sneak King was great.</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Any parting thoughts since you vanished, Alyssa?</p><p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> LMAO. The time my 360 red ringed right before I went up for senior year of college. The day before. And I went out and bought another because not having one wasn’t an option. That or the time my mother heard me cursing out misogynists in Italian?</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Was it on the $3 phone bank operator Xbox 360 headset?</p><p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Beninteso!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 has surpassed expectations with over 5 million unique players during its first week of availability.</p>



<p>EA <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made the announcement</a> as part of its earnings call for Q1 of fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“After the quarter ended, EA Sports College Football 25 welcomed 5 million unique players<br>into the game through its first week, with over 500,000 more playing via the EA Play trial,” EA said via release. </p>



<p>Because the closing of the quarter came after the game’s release, revenue generated from College Football 25 won’t be reported until Q2 FY2025 results come in a few months. As far as what to expect, however, it’s quite astounding.</p>



<p>As previously reported by Insider Gaming, EA was internally hoping to hit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-sees-over-2-million-players-before-full-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-$100 million in revenue</a> for College Football 25 to be considered a success. The expectation has been far surpassed with estimates based off information I’ve gathered from sources putting revenue at over $500 million. It’s worth noting that the estimates don’t include an exact breakdown of Deluxe Editions at $99.99 vs Standard Editions at $69.99. It also doesn’t include any specific information from College Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>I had texted a source about the state of sales after the first week. On July 26, the response was pretty straight forward.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>“Holy ****. The franchise is set up for the future,” the source said.</p>



<p>Based on those first-week player numbers, it’s safe to say they’re right.</p>

<p>EA has released its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025, and the publisher is continuing to pull in money. </p>



<p>EA announced that for the first quarter alone, the company had net bookings of $1.262 billion. That amount surpassed the anticipated amount of $1.25 billion.</p>



<p>“EA delivered a strong start to FY25, beating net bookings guidance as we continue to execute across our business,” said Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA, via press release. </p>



<p>As far as the catalysts for the high earnings, EA says it was “stronger performance across Madden NFL 24, FC Online and FC Mobile.”</p>







<p>Regarding net revenue, EA hit $1.66 billion for the first quarter. Looking forward to the second quarter of FY2025, EA expects net revenue to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. For the rest of the year, EA says net revenue should fall between $7.1 and $7.5 billion. </p>



<p>For FY2025, EA still has numerous major releases including Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Madden NFL 25, EA Sports FC 25, and NHL 25.</p>

It involves visiting the “<em>Tetris</em> universe” inside of the game... which has taught me that there is something called the <em>Tetris</em> universe. Notably, the new <em>Minecraft</em> DLC is a form of dungeon crawler that also involves playing <em>Tetris</em> to find lost Tetriminos, those falling blocks that come in an assortment of iconic shapes. (This also isn’t the first time the two games have crossed over, though the previous collab <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/line-tetris-add">wasn’t quite so weird</a>.)</p><p>I’m not sure I fully understand it, so here’s the synopsis <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-tetris-dlc-on-rotation">from Mojang Studios</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s your job to find the Tetriminos and bring them back. So how do you do that? The grid of blocks remaining after your round of 2D Tetris transforms into a 3D dungeon layout hiding not only the missing Tetriminos, but plenty of surprises –&nbsp;some more welcome than others! Each time you play, you face a unique dungeon. </p><p>The Tetriminos you use, the paths you make, and even how many lines you clear result in new traps, loot, and surprises around every corner. Solve puzzles, scavenge for rewards, and fight monsters as you make your way to the top. There await new Tetriminos that will fill the next dungeon you generate with even more secrets.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>With the DLC, you can also just straight-up play regular <em>Tetris</em> in <em>Minecraft</em>’s lobby, adding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663214/best-ways-to-play-tetris-2023">the many, many ways to experience the classic block-falling puzzle game</a>. The <em>Minecraft</em> x <em>Tetris</em> DLC is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp?id=f684dea8-6dc1-456a-9f5a-8f55fbcc575f">available now</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-lost-48-of-player-count-in-july-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although June 2024 had a really rough lineup for the four games given to PlayStation Plus members, those on a higher tier would have access to a better lineup, with some for the PSVR 2 and some classics for that hit of nostalgia. Between<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-plus-extra-premium-player-count-july-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> June and July 2024</a>, PS Plus Extra lost 48% of its Player Count despite having what seemed to be the better lineup of games.</p>
<p>The number of players utilizing PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium dropped 48%. Even after the Days of Play games for June 2024 are removed from the equation, July continued to see an 18% player count drop. This makes July the lowest player count for PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium thus far in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ps-plus-july-2024-games-for-extra-and-premium-tiers-revealed/">July 2024's line-up</a> gave players access to Remnant 2, the third-highest debut on the streaming service this year. Out of all of the games available through PS Plus, Dave the Diver, which was given to players in April, remains top of the list.</p>
<p>Because of the significant player count drop, July is the weakest month since February 2024 and one of the weakest months for the subscription this year alone. It's quite surprising that July had such a low player count, especially considering Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion was available alongside Remnant 2.</p>
<p>Remnant 2 was the best-performing game of the month, with Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion close behind. However, there was still a comparable drop between the two games of 69.05% fewer people investing time into Final Fantasy. Aside from those two games, the games available for July 2024 were quite weak. Players had access to games such as Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, Job Simulator, and Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters.</p>
<p>A couple of games, such as The Jackbox Party Pack 9 and the recently released JRPG Jeanne d'Arc, had the potential to attract a bigger audience. However, they didn't garner enough interest compared to June's game selection.</p>
<p>One of the biggest games for June 2024 was the addition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas: The Definitive Edition, which remains one of the most popular games in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. In addition to GTA, players were given access to Streets of Rage 4, Tomb Raider: Legend, Far Cry 4, and Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, to name a few. While the main games added to PlayStation Plus didn't do it for the consumers, the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription service tiers more than made up for it.</p>

You may know Doctor Doom from his appearances in the Fox <em>Fantastic Four</em> movies, and for his usual role as that team’s biggest antagonist, but he’s much more than that in the comics.<br></p><p>Doom has starred in a long list of amazing stories that have fleshed out, redefined, and rebuilt the character as one of Marvel’s best players on the grandest universal scale. If the MCU’s version is anything like the Doom in the comics, moviegoers are in for a treat. But 2026 is a long way away, so until then get to know Doom with these seven comics.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50b1a43585d6dabae4ab115d31cb810b" data-recommend-id="image://50b1a43585d6dabae4ab115d31cb810b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white cloaked Doom holds the skeleton of Thanos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white cloaked Doom holds the skeleton of Thanos" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50b1a43585d6dabae4ab115d31cb810b" data-recommend-id="image://50b1a43585d6dabae4ab115d31cb810b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white cloaked Doom holds the skeleton of Thanos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you only read one Doctor Doom-related comic to get to know the villain and what he might be like in the MCU, I would recommend legendary Marvel writer Jonathan Hickman’s run on the character. This is cheating though, as Hickman built up his take on Doom starting in 2009 on <em>Fantastic Four</em> and ending in 2016 with the conclusion of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Secret Wars</em></a></span> event comic. That’s roughly seven years of comics to read, which is daunting, though I promise it is worth it.<br></p><p>Across <em>Fantastic Four</em>, <em>Avengers</em>, <em>New Avengers</em>, and <em>Secret Wars</em>, Hickman’s portrayal of Doom as a man who works on the highest level possible in the universe is fascinating. He’s basically playing 5D chess at all times, and watching Doom concern himself with the end of the multiverse and the killing of gods, essentially on his own, is badass. 2027’s <em>Avengers Secret Wars</em> bares the same name as Hickman’s climactic finale, so you can bet it’ll be a major inspiration for the MCU.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0965a4a0551b79323eb9f1cb26774a3c" data-recommend-id="image://0965a4a0551b79323eb9f1cb26774a3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom wears silver iron man armor and a large cloak" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom wears silver iron man armor and a large cloak" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0965a4a0551b79323eb9f1cb26774a3c" data-recommend-id="image://0965a4a0551b79323eb9f1cb26774a3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom wears silver iron man armor and a large cloak" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With Robert Downey Jr. taking on the role of Doom, many are wondering if the MCU’s version of the character will be a variant of Tony Stark. Whether he is or not, there is a lot of history between Stark and Doom in the comics. My favorite book that delves into that relationship is Brian Michael Bendis’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Infamous Iron Man</em></a></span>.<br></p><p>The premise is essentially, “What if Victor von Doom took over the mantle of Iron Man?” Following Stark’s death in <em>Civil War II</em>, Doom steps into the armor and starts fighting crime with his new suit while also welding a lot of magic. The comic puts Doom in an interesting position we haven’t seen him in before and digs into some emotional connections between the two characters. Bendis is a great character writer, and that is on full display in <em>Infamous Iron Man</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eed9c23ce9e99b0af162e4158e40548e" data-recommend-id="image://eed9c23ce9e99b0af162e4158e40548e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="661" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom and Doctor Strange blast enemies with rays" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom and Doctor Strange blast enemies with rays" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eed9c23ce9e99b0af162e4158e40548e" data-recommend-id="image://eed9c23ce9e99b0af162e4158e40548e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="661" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom and Doctor Strange blast enemies with rays" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you got confused just now when I mentioned Doctor Doom using magic, then boy, have I got news for you.

Over four issues, Doom tempts each member of the Fantastic Four with their desires or sabotages their lives. That isn’t that hard considering Morrison writes the team with a lot of baggage under their seemingly happy relationships. It’s a great dismantling of Marvel’s first family that could only be done by Morrison.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37192c0c818e978ac5feca0d639e4684" data-recommend-id="image://37192c0c818e978ac5feca0d639e4684" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom sits on a throne" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom sits on a throne" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37192c0c818e978ac5feca0d639e4684" data-recommend-id="image://37192c0c818e978ac5feca0d639e4684" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom sits on a throne" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sure, you know that Doctor Doom is the de facto enemy of the Fantastic Four, but what do you <em>really</em> know about the man behind the metal mask? Over the decades, a number of writers have fleshed out his backstory, much of which has become as convoluted as comics can be. Ed Brubaker’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/3006/books_of_doom_2005_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/3006/books_of_doom_2005_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Books of Doom</em></a></span> is a succinct summary of that backstory.<br></p><p>Told mostly from the perspective of the villian himself, <em>Books of Doom </em>will take you through the life of the Fantastic Four’s greatest enemy. That includes his path to big bad, but also offers insights into his parents, especially his mystic mother. If you’ve only ever encountered Doom as a monologuing villain waiting to get defeated, then learning more about the intricacies of the character and his motivations is a must.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94f0c3d531fd9fa2261819fe1cf2d684" data-recommend-id="image://94f0c3d531fd9fa2261819fe1cf2d684" data-format="jpg" data-width="1156" data-height="649" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom folds his arms in front of colorful art" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom folds his arms in front of colorful art" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94f0c3d531fd9fa2261819fe1cf2d684" data-recommend-id="image://94f0c3d531fd9fa2261819fe1cf2d684" data-format="jpg" data-width="1156" data-height="649" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doom folds his arms in front of colorful art" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I’ll be the first to admit that reading traditional superhero comics…kind of sucks. It never feels like a good time to jump on, and with constant reboots and crossovers a lot of storylines never get the time they need. But if you just want to dive into what Doom is up to right now, with as little bullshit as possible, there is an option for you. This May, Jonathan Hickman gave us another Doom story worth reading in collaboration with Sanford Greene.<br></p><p>Simply titled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/112131/doom_2024_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/112131/doom_2024_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Doom #1</em></a></span>, this one-shot story sees the titular villain go on a universe-spanning mission to defeat Galactus. It’s a quick read that will still give you a good feel for who Doom is as a character. And hey, if you like it, then you can dive into something meatier.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="674db475e8acbb5e63ff3e20dd391548" data-recommend-id="image://674db475e8acbb5e63ff3e20dd391548" data-format="jpg" data-width="1191" data-height="672" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doombot holds up the head of an android" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doombot holds up the head of an android" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="674db475e8acbb5e63ff3e20dd391548" data-recommend-id="image://674db475e8acbb5e63ff3e20dd391548" data-format="jpg" data-width="1191" data-height="672" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doombot holds up the head of an android" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This choice is just for fun, as it isn’t strictly about Doctor Doom.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earth-defense-force-6-review.940716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Some studios will spend years of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars chasing emotional, Hollywood-quality stories and realistic graphics, but the Earth Defense Force series proudly prefers to remain the most pure video game nonsense ever conceived. Don’t be fooled by the PS3-era graphics, atrocious voice acting, absurd story, and uneven technical performance of Earth Defense Force 6 – developer Sandlot knows exactly what it’s doing with this over-the-top satire that makes Helldivers 2 look highbrow by comparison. Like its predecessors, EDF6 leans into its rough edges and silly cooperative mayhem, prioritizing mindless fun above all else, and the result is yet another wonderfully amusing entry in the ongoing saga. But even going in with the right expectations, it’s not all sunshine and dismembered thoraxes, as this inadvisably long campaign has tons of repetition, plenty of levels that are more boring than amusing, and at times crosses the line from knowingly campy to just plain bad. Still, this giant insect-filled monster fest is more often than not a hilariously good time, and that’s something we could certainly use more of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Earth Defense Force 6 screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is a goofy as heck cooperative third-person shooter that throws you and up to three friends into a version of our world under siege by aliens. Called the Primus, these primarily insectoid invaders are a grab bag of dorky monsters that range from generic flying drones, knockoff Godzilla kaiju, oversized evil Battletoads, massive spiders that jump everywhere, and more. Across the 80+ hours it took me to complete its 147 level main campaign, you’ll blast these low-res goons to bits using a growing arsenal of guns, rocket launchers, grenades, turrets, vehicles, and giant Gundam mechs, some of which feel great while others are experiments gone horribly wrong. Wrap all of this ridiculousness in some contentedly outdated graphics and a framerate that becomes unstable whenever your explosive shenanigans reach a fever pitch, and you’re in for an uproarious good time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in seconds.</p></div><p>You’ll also bounce between four returning character classes: the Ranger, a standard soldier whose only advantage is that their weapons are the best around; the Wing Diver, a Valkyrie-like class whose jet-pack and wings give her unmatched mobility (offset by the fact that she’s killed by a light breeze); the Air Raider, an often second-fiddle support class who specializes in calling in massive bombing runs, relies on gadgets like drones to squish bugs, and can summon vehicles to deal serious damage; and the Fencer, a dual-wielding tank class who can absorb serious damage with a giant shield and smash things to bits in melee, but who is also quite difficult to play well. It might be a little milquetoast, but I favor the Ranger – it’s just hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in a few seconds and assault rifles that plow through hundreds of aliens with ease.</p><p>While the stories in Earth Defense Force games have always been charming rubbish, EDF 6 sets a new bar with a tale that actively makes no sense at various points (even if, like me, you’re following along very closely and occasionally taking notes). It makes heavy use of time travel and has humanity losing the war against the Primus, only for you and the aliens to both go back in time to try again – but the good guys perplexingly make very little use of the knowledge gained in the previous timeline, so you’ll have to watch them slowly piece together what’s happening while you and your character are already miles ahead of the buffoons trying saving humanity. </p><p>Most of the time, this insanity is as amusing as you might hope, like when one part introduces giant frog enemies and says they’re “just like humans” without addressing the fact that they’re clearly frogs, then later introduces cliche humanoid gray martian enemies and describes them as “not humanoid.” Other times, though, it’s just painful, like one section where they explain the origins and biological breakdown of a flying dragon monster while making you fight it about five times in a row, reminiscent of a filler episode of Dragonball Z. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story's insanity is as amusing as you might hope most of the time.</p></div><p>The extremely poorly written story is eclipsed in its dreadfulness only by the voice acting, which sounds like it was performed by some poor souls who were rejected by their local improv troupes and decided to give video game voices a try. One part nearly made me spit-take when a character says, in the most monotone voice imaginable, “you have no idea how relieved I am” – you’re right, my dude, I definitely do not. But between all of that cringey dialogue and senseless plot development, there’s a ton of joy. There is still plenty of the kind of bad-by-design silliness at which EDF excels, and the times where it manages to walk that line properly are a gift that keeps on giving.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Thankfully, the heart and soul of Earth Defense Force 6, its over-the-top combat against all manner of blurry foes, is actually a lot of fun – and oftentimes pretty darn challenging. Dodging, dashing, and flying out of the way as monsters, aliens, overgrown insects, and robots rock the screen (and threaten the framerate) is exactly the kind of action-packed madness I love about this series, and it’s never been done better than in this iteration. The fundamentals of that action may be almost identical to what we got a few games ago, but EDF6 adds a ton of weapons and new enemy types to the mix and then dreams up interesting scenarios to put you in, like one level where you’re defending a beach from an entire army of giant poisonous reptiles. Playing through on the normal difficulty can be challenging enough, especially if you don’t have a competent crew at your back, but it gets absolutely insane once you dial that up to the harder options. It requires an intense amount of grinding to get the requisite powerful weapons and armor to put up a fight, plus a team who absolutely knows what they’re doing. As with prior entries, combat’s simple setup and silly attitude don’t get in the way of being extremely entertaining and genuinely satisfying to overcome, and that can make it pretty hard to put down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Funniest Games List</h3><p>If you like a little gaming with your jokes, these are the games to play.</p></div><p>That said, some of the design decisions definitely go a step beyond janky fun and into being straight up obnoxious, like how if you’re killed and waiting to be revived by a teammate, you just have to sit there staring at your own corpse until they come to get you. There’s no option to watch what other players are doing if they aren’t standing right by you and no respawn timer, which is just plain boring. There are also a handful of maps you’ll find yourself running missions on quite a few times, and while the enemies and objectives are usually at least a little different, the lack of variety definitely grated on me at times. Also, you’re occasionally made to play some slower-paced, story-focused levels that are simply the worst, though they at least only show up at a few specific moments. This isn’t the kind of story that’s at all worth slowing down the pacing to tell, and those segments just absolutely waste your time in a campaign that’s already way longer than it probably should be.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is yet another riotous entry in one of the most ridiculous and corny series ever to make very poor use of our fancy gaming hardware. It looks at least a decade out of date, is absolutely dripping with plot holes and awful voice acting, and has some of the silliest combat I’ve seen in a long time – but all of that only works to its credit, coming together as a game I’ve happily lost dozens of hours of my life to while giggling like an idiot. Not all of its rough edges add to its charm, though, and an overly long campaign filled with repetitive levels and some irritating design choices definitely work against it. But those things are pretty easy to forgive when you accidentally blow your friends up with a rocket launcher that sends giant ants sailing into the air and skyscrapers crumbling into rubble.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a lot riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard for BioWare, and it sounds like the upcoming fantasy RPG has a colossal script to match the pressure.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar</u></a>, creative director John Epler and creative performance director Ashley Barlow explained why it’s taken so long to get the fourth Dragon Age game, as it’s been ten years since Dragon Age: Inquisition. Barlow revealed that casting on The Veilguard started five years ago, and there’s been a <em>lot</em> of work done since then.</p><p>“It takes a long time to record 700 characters, you know - 80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks,” Barlow said. “It just takes time to make good."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/da-main-1721989925742-1722365616799.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard's big script size has been revealed. </figcaption></figure></output><p>It's worth highlighting the caveat that Barlow makes within that figure, specifying that it's the Rooks that push it up to 140,000. Rook is the name for the playable protagonist in The Veilguard, and there are four voice actors to choose from (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more"><u>BioWare revealed the voice casting</u></a> for the Rooks and the companions last week). So, that <em>could</em> mean it’s just at 80,000 lines without taking into account the four Rook voices. </p><p>Taken at face value, however, that 140,000 number puts it above Inquisition, which previously had the most lines of dialogue of any Dragon Age game with <a href="https://kotaku.com/4-158-323-creatures-died-in-last-six-months-of-dragon-a-1663463262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>88,000 lines</u></a>. It’s <em>probably</em> still not as much as Baldur’s Gate 3 which, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals"><u>according to Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke</u></a>, contains triple the word count of Lord of the Rings, and it’s also under Starfield, which apparently contains an absolutely <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-dialogue-trees-revealed-in-new-video"><u>massive 250,000 lines of dialogue</u></a>. Still, it’s nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>More Dragon Age: The Veilguard information has been revealed in recent days, especially as some of the developers and voice cast hit San Diego Comic-Con last week (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamershttps://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a special SDCC exception was made</u></a> for the SAG-AFTRA video game strike <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-officially-go-on-strike-over-ai-protections"><u>that was called last week</u></a>).

The Evangelion elements are more subtle on this one, but they still look great as each Y-light looks like it was pulled straight from the EVA-01 cockpit.</p><p>Lastly, you can check out this set of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D672GP6T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Govee Evangelion light bars</a></strong>. These vertical gaming light bars react to the sounds from your games and movies, syncing with the audio from your speakers and headphones to create an immersive experience. They have a color scheme based on the EVA-01 mech, Evangelion-inspired lighting effects, and you can personalize their output with the Govee DreamView smartphone app.</p><p>Alternatively, if you're looking to revisit the world of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Amazon has all of the original series, OVA, and films available on Blu-ray alongside the grand remake saga of movies and a very cool limited-edition vinyl soundtrack.</p><h3><strong>Evangelion Blu-ray and soundtrack deals</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Complete-Blu-ray/dp/B07GQ8VXZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Complete Series</a> -- $39 ($<strike>60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evangelion-Thrice-Limited-Steelbook-Blu-ray/dp/B0D136B49L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: Thrice Upon a Time (Steelbook)</a> -- $30 (<del>$37</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVANGELION-1-11-THRICE-UPON-Blu-ray/dp/B0CC4JV5XJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: Thrice Upon a Time (Standard)</a> -- $21.70 ($<del>30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVANGELION-1-11-THRICE-UPON-Collectors/dp/B0CC4GFWDF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: Thrice Upon a Time 4K Collector's Edition</a> -- $56 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evangelion-2-22-You-Advance-Blu-ray/dp/B004EC5IUW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: You Can (Not) Advance</a> -- $15 ($<del>35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEON-GENESIS-EVANGELION-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0C6YZ3CF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion: Original Soundtrack</a> -- $40</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-bundle-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-only-159-at-walmart/1100-6522718/">Nintendo Switch Lite Bundle With Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is Only $159 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-back-to-school-sale-2024-ps5-games-playstation-vr-ps5-slim-deals/2900-5638/">PlayStation Back To School Sale: Save Over 50% On PS5 Exclusives, $200 On PSVR 2, And $50 On Consoles</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-drops-to-best-price-yet-alongside-more-great-ps5-game-deals/1100-6525363/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Drops To Best Price Yet Alongside More Great PS5 Game Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-playstation-back-to-school-sale-ps5-deals/1100-6525364/">PlayStation VR 2 Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount At Amazon And More Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-8tb-starfield-inspired-desktop-hard-drive-is-back-in-stock-for-150-after-selling-out-twice/1100-6524711/">Seagate 8TB Starfield Game Drive Restocked At Best Buy, Discounted To Only $150</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-buys-great-summer-sale-huge-discounts-on-games-laptops-action-figures-and-more/1100-6525209/">Best Buy's Great Summer Sale: Huge Discounts On Games, Laptops, Action Figures, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-prime-day-deal/1100-6522041/">Super Mario Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209717/mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-cancelled-nfts-esports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For almost 20 years, Nintendo and Sega have released <em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games </em>to coincide with the international sporting event. But now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">according to a report in <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, that tradition is at an end. In 2020, the IOC made the decision to not renew the game’s licensing deal, ending a run of games that’s covered most Summer and Winter Olympic Games since 2007. </p><p>“Basically the IOC wanted to bring [the licensing] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money,” Lee Cocker, a developer who worked on the <em>Mario &amp; Sonic</em> franchise, told <em>Eurogamer</em>. </p><p>Strangely though, those “other partners” are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075239/the-nft-world-is-consolidating">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/heres-how-some-esports-orgs-are-positioning-themselves-to-withstand-esports-winter/">esports</a> — products that are not currently known for their money-making possibilities. To coincide with the Paris Games, the IOC, in collaboration with <em>Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid</em> studio nWay, has developed <em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em>, a mobile game featuring minigames based on Olympic events. <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/">According to the game’s website</a>, players are able to claim an “officially licensed, commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin.” </p><p>Esports at the Olympics isn’t a new concept. The IOC hosted several summits to determine how best to incorporate esports events with the Olympics in 2017 and 2018 — during the height of esports’ popularity (and financial viability). In 2021, the Olympics held its first medal event called the Olympic Virtual Series and featured games including baseball, sailing, cycling, and motorsports. In June, the IOC announced its <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-eb-proposes-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-to-ioc-session">creation of the Olympic Esports Games</a> to coincide with the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the event held in 2025 and <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia">hosted by Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html">now a popular</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/saudi-arabia-expands-its-sportswashing-ambitions-to-the-world-of-gaming">if controversial</a>, esports destination.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-begins-on-august-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard unveiled Diablo IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-5-brings-players-back-to-hell-with-roguelite-mode-expands-weapon-types-available-to-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season of the Infernal Hordes</a>, the fifth live-service season for the action RPG, slated to launch on August 6. Here's an overview of what players can expect with Season of the Infernal Hordes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infernal Hordes is a wave-based feature that can be played solo or with friends. Between waves, players can select Infernal Offerings (a boon or curse to enhance a run) to increase the potency of the enemy and the final rewards.</li>
<li>The new Infernal Hordes feature can be accessed on both realms, where it will be interwoven through a seasonal quest line on the Seasonal Realm and accessible after a short new quest line on the Eternal Realm in World Tier III.</li>
<li>At the end of each Infernal Hordes run, players will face the Fell Council. There are 5 Fell Council members in total, and 3 different members will be randomly selected to fight you. Be aware of their unique abilities in the various combinations you'll encounter.</li>
<li>New Hellbreach dungeons will be available in the seasonal realm to give players a taste of what to expect in Infernal Hordes. These dungeons will reward players with Burning Aether, which can be spent on chests at the end of the dungeon.</li>
<li>Over 50 new Uniques and Legendaries are coming with the season and will remain available in Diablo IV even after the season ends. Earn these items by killing enemies throughout Sanctuary and in the Infernal Hordes.</li>
<li>Earn Seasonal Progression by collecting caches dropped by slaying powerful servants of Hell. Once you've unlocked Seasonal Progression, the Infernal Hordes feature is one of the best ways to increase your reputation and earn caches throughout the season.<br>
Earn even more rewards by progressing through the Season Journey and completing the new Battle Pass, which includes 28 Free Tiers and 62 Premium Tiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PC Public Test Realm allowed Blizzard to gather a lot of useful feedback, which led to changes to the version of Season of the Infernal Hordes that will go live next week. The official blog <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Acquire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> highlights those modifications in bolded red.</p>
<p>On August 1 at 11 AM Pacific Time, Blizzard will have a Developer Update Livestream that dives further into Diablo IV Season of the Infernal Hordes. You can watch those on YouTube and Twitch.</p>
