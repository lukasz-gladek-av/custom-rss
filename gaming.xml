			<p>Nintendo streamed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/">Mario Kart World Direct</a> this morning, which included a more detailed look at gameplay in Mario Kart World, and some of the new features players can expect.</p>
<p>The presentation was only 15 minutes long, and was a back-to-back dive into different aspects of Mario Kart World, like some of the new courses, characters, tricks, items and game modes for players in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>We know plenty of the big news about Mario Kart World, like the fact that the new open-world setting means we can drive anywhere and spend time freely roaming around the world and the tracks. The direct also showed for the first time that there are plenty of challenges and hidden items to find while doing so, like blue-coin P challenges to discover, hidden coins and hidden panels.</p>
<p>You can also use photo mode whenever you want while in free roam, and if you're playing with friends online, or even locally, you don't necessarily jump into a race or Grand Prix to play together. You can instead just drive around the world, enjoy the views, and create your own fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased eight of the courses we'll all be racing on, with some returning tracks players will recognize and some brand new. Rest assured there is more than what was shown, but the ones we got to look at were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario Shipyard</li>
</ul>
<p>We also got a not-so-slight-hint that to unlock Mario Kart World's version of the infamous Rainbow Road, you'll have to complete and win each of the Grand Prix's in the game. Regarding the characters you can race as, we once again didn't get a look at the full roster, but we did get a closer look at four of the new racers, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Cow</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Lakitu</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of new items, six items were highlighted in the direct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Feather</li>
<li>Ice Flower</li>
<li>Coin Shell</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the six shown, being able to use Kamek's magic looks like it will be the most interesting one, and the one with the potential to really shake things up in the race, as you transform your competing racers into various things. The rest seem like your bog-standard hazards and boosts, though when combined with the increased number of road hazards that'll just appear in each track, which we also got a look at, these races are shaping up to be some of the most hectic in the entire series.</p>
<p>Nintendo also confirmed that the racing wheel for the Joy-Con controllers is back with the Joy-Con 2 Wheel, purpose-built for the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, and racers new to the series will have similar features included in Mario Kart 8, like smart steering at their disposal, should they need it.</p>
<p>The last two new features shown in the direct that seem to bring a good deal of change to the game were two new tricks, Rewind and Charge Jump. The latter is kind of like an ollie on a skateboard, where you'll just jump straight up to help you avoid obstacles, but also jump onto grind rails to reach new areas, and find new paths on each track.</p>
<p>Rewind does exactly what it sounds like it does, and rewinds what you've just done in-game so you can try again. But you're not rewinding the entire race when you use it, you're only rewinding the actions you've taken. Which means if you rewind while in 1st place because you want to try grinding a rail again, you can put yourself in 2nd just to try and get that sick clip.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a solid showcase of what's to come in Mario Kart World, but whether it did as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Doug Bowser</a> hoped it would, and convince players that Mario Kart World is worth its $80 price tag, is to be determined.</p>
<p>If you want to check out more about Mario Kart World, you can read what we thought when we went <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the game at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 event</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new force for Cygnar, the Gravediggers, with their first releases, the Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>From The Skies!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction for Warmachine, and can trace their history back to the early days of Warmachine in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original Warmachine and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>

<p>There's a roadmap of releases planned for them, but they begin with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which features a perfect 30-point army to jump straight into games with them, and follows those starter forces from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Scum</a> and provides players with one of each unit type. Releasing alongside the Command Starter is the Gravediggers Battlegroup Box, which features a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks to expand your Command Starter, or start playing at lower model count games. Both of these sets feature crates and items that make use of their Airdrop rules, and we'll go into details of both sets and their rules below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=1CYBU9rU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=eeKNW4CU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Command Starter Set.</figcaption></figure><h2>Watch Out For Buck</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Starter Set is a great introduction to how the Gravediggers like to play, which is sneaky and devastating. This box is led by&nbsp;Captain Buck Hasker, who has Prowl, which gives him stealth if he has concealment, protecting him from attacks more than 5 inches away. He also passes this on to his Warjack, which means that every unit in this box has Prowl. Buck likes to leap from concealment and chain attacks with Killing Spree, which lets him make an additional attack if he removes an enemy model in melee. His close combat weapon, Fang, which stops the use of Tough, makes doing that a lot easier. His feat allows him to place 3 mine tokens within his control range, which deal damage and knock down any enemies coming within 3 inches of them. This is great for protecting him while he gets some wet work done, effectively locking him into an area with his target.</p>

<p>Buck's Warjack, Plugger, is an absolute beast of a heavy Warjack. Operating like Buck, moving to engage its target, and if destroyed, making a full advance back into hiding. Plugger comes with Stealth (not Prowl), which means he doesn't have to be in concealment to gain the benefits of Stealth. Plugger comes armed with dual trench rippers and a metal storm cannon to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=xeITb1tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=mQxQWgIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buck's Gravediggers prepare for action.</figcaption></figure><p>Buck and Plugger are backed up by Sergeant Brunaugh "Bruno" Ramjaw and the Rowdies, who all have Prowl and Advanced Deployment, to get them closer to the action and harder to target. Ramjaw uses a backpack-fed minigun to knock infantry troops back. The Rowdies give each other overlapping buffs while they're still on the field. Killing Spree, Reposition, and Precision Fire are all granted to each other, and they all come with Smoke Bombs as standard to make them difficult to target, which is helpful as they're all fairly short ranged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=G_NBBYdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=755D-BVF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Plugger is an absolute monster in combat, and their airdrops make the whole army super adaptable.</figcaption></figure><p>This box also comes with an Ammo Crate and Medical Crate miniature, which can be taken as command cards and allows you to drop the crate within 1 inch of the activating unit. The Ammo Crate lets a nearby friendly unit gain Magical to its attacks and by dealing 1 damage to the crate, boost the range or power of their ranged attack by 2. The Medical Crate allows nearby friendly units to deal one damage to the crate, to either remove a damage from a model with Tough that is disabled nearby, or remove D3+2 damage from a living model, or return a Grunt to a unit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=B-NYXsbw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=JyKS4YZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Battle Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>Like Father, Like Daughter</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box works a little differently to the Command Starter in that it includes a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks, and doesn't make a clean 30-point force. It can create a 30-point force, but the Warjacks have a variety of weapon options, so you'll have to do some planning before you build them. The set is great if you want to play a 30-point game with a smaller number of units, or perfect if you want to expand beyond the Command Starter.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box includes&nbsp;Captain Cynthia 'Cyn' Rosko, who is the daughter of the famous&nbsp;Allister Caine we covered in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>. Rosko has inherited her father's affinity to magic and comes armed with the Witch Hammer rocket launcher, which allows her to ignore cloud effects and stealth to strike her target if she aims. Her feat grants all models in her battleground and control range to make an additional ranged or melee attack that turn, which can mean an absolutely insane gunline attack for 1 turn.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=nOAnYbm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=VwTkrKuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko can set up an insane gunline with her feat.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of the Warjacks in this set, the Valient (Heavy Warjack) and the Patriot (Light Warjack), come with build options for their heads and weapons. The head options give different abilities, which for the Valiant, means choosing between being faster and able to charge without spending a focus point, moving after being hit with an attack, a free move if it didn't run during the turn, and free move and attack if a friendly unit is taken out nearby. The Patriot also has 4 weapon options for each arm, which vary in point costs and types. Personally I'm a fan of the Volley Gun/Shield and Heavy Mortar loadout to rain down fire on anyone threatening the rest of the Gravediggers as they close the distance on their enemies.</p>

<p>The Patriot also has 4 head options, an arc node that allows casters to channel through it, the ability to move after taking out an enemy, a&nbsp;free move if it didn't run during the turn, or can bodyguard a nearby friendly unit. As with the Valiant, the Patriot comes with 4 weapon options for each arm, and how you want to use your Warjacks will determine how you arm them, including getting the best use of the rest of your force's buffs and your Warcaster's feat. Personally I'm a fan of the Sniper Cannon and Blaster/Shield combo to lay down fire at rage and boost your Warjack's armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=XWnFyP9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=NDRu67Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko loves to set up a gunline, and the heavy weapons crate just reinforces it.</figcaption></figure><p>Also in the Gravediggers Battle Box is a heavy weapons crate which works with the Heavy Airdrop Command Card. This card allows you to drop a Blocker or a Skirmisher Warjack onto the battlefield, or a Heavy Weapons Crate, which the Valiant Warjack can interact with to gain a Heavy Flamethrower, Howitzer, or Rocket Pod. It also gains +1 armor for the rest of the game, and a bonus focus point for the turn it interacts with the crate. This adaptability is one of the Gravedigger's greatest strengths, and your opponent will never be sure if you're about to get another Warjack, or your Valient is about to gain an extra weapon and go to town on their forces.</p>



<p>I'm so glad that the release of the Gravediggers coincided with me getting back into <em>Warmachine,</em> as they feel like a faction perfectly suited to my style of play. I love that they're a hard as nails combat force, but they're also super sneaky and insanely adaptable to the changing battlefield. These 2 boxes offer a dual style of entry. The clean Command Starter, with its fixed armaments and full roster of unit types, or the smaller Battle Box that still shows what the Gravediggers are all about, and has customization options for the Warjacks' loadouts. Their paratrooper/special forces feel sits well with me, and their theme is captured extremely well in their mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with previous <em>Warmachine</em> releases, these set are just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with the Gravediggers is easy.</p>

The publisher held a <em>Mario Kart World</em> direct presentation on April 17th debuting 15 minutes of gameplay which showcased many of the game’s new features.</p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> will feature a bunch of new courses to race through. There’s Mario Bros Circuit, the desert roadtrip-looking course Nintendo’s shown off in every <em>Mario Kart World</em> video; an urban course called Crown City; Salty Salty Speedway, which is one of <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s water levels; and many more including returning classics like Peach Beach and Wario Shipyard. Nintendo also hinted that once you complete all the Grand Prix cups a “certain colorful course” will appear which can’t be anything other than the iconic Rainbow Road.</p><p>There are lots of new items, features, and settings to make the most out of your race to the finish. The new feather item lets you jump to avoid attacks. The new rewind feature lets you rewind time so you can hit that missed trick or jump to find secret areas. Speaking of secret areas, in the game’s free roam mode you can find all kinds of hidden secrets like P-switches and panels that unlock overworld missions to complete. Nintendo’s gone all out to make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the standout game for the Switch 2 — now if only the US could pre-order the dang thing.</p><p>You can watch the full event below:</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">initial excitement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2</a> has cooled.

(Trump has decreed a 90-day pause on the tariffs which ostensibly gives Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">more time to ship to the US as many units as it can</a>.)</p></div><p>The games too will be more expensive, with some titles, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>, blowing past the $70 price point <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">to retail at $80</a>. That is, if you can even get the console to play it. US consumers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">cannot yet pre-order the Switch 2</a> (once again, thanks to the tariffs) which has also impeded Canada from pre-orders as well.

            <p>Harken to the tolling of the village bell! See the blazing of the watchfires on the parapet! CD Projekt have issued a warning about Witcher 4 beta scams. Apparently, people have been receiving invites to playtest the new Witcher, even though CD Projekt have previously said that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't release before 2027</a>. If you sign up to anything right now, the only thing you'll be beta-testing is how fast you can change all your usernames and passwords.</p>

<p>"Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - this is a scam!" shrieks a <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">social media post</a>, like a cleric at the chapel door ushering the peasants inside. "We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."</p>
<p>"Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams," the post adds, just in case that immersion-breaking mention of email clients had sabotaged your day with the knowledge that you are not, in fact, a greying leathery Lothario with a silver sword. "They see right through them and slay them!"</p>
<p>Not to rap you on the nose with a rolled-up lore bible, CD Projekt, but I think that characterisation does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-explain-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer-geralt-could-have-said-this-about-ciri-as-well">The Witcher's emotive branching storytelling</a> a disservice. If this were a quest from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Geralt would probably trace the scammers to their lair and discover that they are actually small orphan children who were cruelly disfigured and cast out by the villagers on account of having hairy toes, or something. He would have to decide between butchering them or butchering the villagers or blowing up Megaton. Then he would partake in some sex with a witch (I 'ardly knew 'er, etc) and play a rousing round of Triple Triad. I confess, my memories of The Witcher 3 are a little rusty.</p>
<p>"Should we ever organize any beta tests in the future, you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites," CD Projekt conclude. While you wait, you can re-read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) frenzied demands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-needs-a-double-jumping-horse-like-elden-ring-or-im-out">for a double-jumping horse</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it’s been steeped in some controversy along the way, the kart racer looks like a pretty substantial leap forward after a decade of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Nintendo held a dedicated Direct showcase for the game this morning, and if you want to watch the 15-minute presentation you can do so below. For everyone who just wants some of the highlights, here are some of the new things we learned during showcase.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Direct started with a showcase of different courses, including new tracks and reimaginings of old ones. Some of the courses Nintendo spotlighted were the metropolis Crown City, the Venice-esque Salty Salty Speedway, the icy trails of Starview Peak, and a drive-in theater called Boo Cinema. Some of the old tracks from previous games that will be reimagined for World include Toad’s Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two main racing modes in <em>Mario Kart World </em>are the classic Grand Prix seen in previous games that takes you and 23 other players through multiple courses to see who comes out on top, and a new mode called Knockout Tour. These are lengthy, multi-track races that gradually pick off players as they go on. Racers will drive through different checkpoints that will gradually eliminate players in the lower positions. It’s kind of like <em>Mario Kart</em> battle royale.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo showed off new usable items that will help give you an edge in a race. Some new ones include: The Coin shell that puts coins on the track for you (or your enemies) to grab, the Ice Flower that freezes your enemies, Hammers, thrown in a classic Hammer Bros. arc, to smash and block your opponents where they land, Mega Mushrooms that make you big enough to run over your enemies, Feathers that give you more air time and let you find alternate routes, and Kamek, which seems like a bit of a wild card item that can have different effects.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo announced a few features and playstyles that will help the game be more accessible. The big one is smart steering that keeps you from driving off the side of the track, as well as motion controls for people who want to steer using the Joy-Con controllers’ support for that functionality.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-recommend-id="image://cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-recommend-id="image://cad0fa7d826fb69dba5388161b7c7a5f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi dragging a pizza around behind him in a striped shirt and bowtie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We already knew that <em>Mario Kart World</em> would include new outfits for multiple characters, but we now have a little more insight into how you unlock them. Throughout the open world, you’ll find different meals that will unlock new threads based on the food you take to go. For example, if you eat sushi, you’ll unlock traditional Japanese clothing. Once you chow down, you’ll be able to access these costumes in the character select screen.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-recommend-id="image://76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-recommend-id="image://76e9c30c102bcd3a4dbef77ea7d2f3d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of wall riding in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> adds a few new maneuvers to give you more options while racing. You can jump to avoid incoming obstacles, drive on walls, and rewind to get a second shot at jumping to an alternate route. However, your rivals will continue to drive normally while you rewind, so it has its drawbacks.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-recommend-id="image://d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-recommend-id="image://d10bf8d080b034c21b3ded911913e1f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shy Guy riding around in Free Roam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the 24-player races are the big central draw of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game is including modes that let you race with friends or play in solitude. Time Trials are returning, and will include ghost data from other players for you to compete against as you try to get a new personal best time. VS Race lets you customize a race’s ruleset, and supports up to four teams so several players can group up together for a collective score. Battle modes Coin Runners and Balloon Battle are also returning, letting you duke it out with other racers. Free Roam is exactly what it sounds like, and lets you drive around the game’s open world to explore, solve puzzles, and find collectibles. While you race and explore the world, you’ll be able to use a photo mode to take cool screenshots of all your sick tricks and neat discoveries.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of the appeal of Free Roam is getting to zone out and ride around without the pressures of racing, and you can play it with friends and drive around the open world together. Using the Switch 2's chat button will allow you to voice chat as you ride around, and you can take photos together with the photo mode. And whether you’re Free Roaming with friends or alone, it seems the world is packed with things to discover, including P Switches that start challenges, as well as special hidden coins, panels to activate (for some as of yet unknown purpose), and more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Your choice of leader, though, sticks with you throughout the entire game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they don’t provide as many traits and units as Civilizations, Leaders still have powerful abilities that can create some excellent combinations when mixed and matched. To help you out, we’ve created this tier list of every Leader and highlighted their strengths and weaknesses. This should help you choose who you want to be the face of your empire as you build your future all the way into the Modern Age. </p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civilization 7 Leader Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-Tier</strong> - Confucius, Xerxes King of Kings, Ashoka World Conquerer, Augustus</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-Tier</strong> - Ashoka World Renouncer, Benjamin Franklin, Charlemagne, Harriet Tubman, Hatshepsut, Himiko High Shaman, Isabella, Jose Rizal, Machiavelli, Trung Trac, Xerxes The Achaemenid</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B-Tier</strong> - Amina, Catherine The Great, Friedrich Oblique, Ibn Battuta, Lafayette, Napoleon Emperor, Napoleon Revolution, Tecumseh, Himiko Queen of Wa </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C-Tier</strong> - Friedrich Baroque, Pachacuti</p><h2 data-cy="title2">S-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-s-tier-1744891859075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Ashoka, World Conquerer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Production for every 5 excess Happiness in Cities.</li><li>+10% Production in Settlements not founded by you.</li><li>Declaring a Formal War grants a Celebration. +5 Combat Strength against Districts for all Units during a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashoka, World Conquerer is all about keeping your own citizens happy while terrorizing other civilizations. Happiness is a very strong yield, and as long as you can keep a strong flow of excess Happiness, you will get continual benefits. Settlements not founded by you and excess Happiness result in extra Production meaning you can make a lot of Units and maintain a strong base to fuel your war efforts. Also, declaring a Formal War grants you an automatic Celebration. This gives you an instant +5 Combat Strength against Districts and All Units. This makes you excellent at putting your enemy on the back foot immediately once a war is declared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all the excess Happiness, you can likely get one or two extra Celebrations during a war, so you go through periods of extreme military power. The only thing to manage is, as you take over Settlements from your fellow civs, dealing with the unrest they bring. However, if you can manage that and keep everyone happy, Ashoka, World Conquerer is one of the strongest leaders in the game. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Augustus</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Production in the Capital for every Town. Can purchase Culture Buildings in Towns.</li><li>+50% Gold towards purchasing Buildings in Towns.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Augustus gets a lot of benefits from a relatively straightforward style of play. He is all about going wide with his Settlements and establishing as many Towns as possible, be that through settling or conquest. Interestingly though, his value comes in not upgrading Towns to City. That saves him Gold, but he gets a nice bonus to Gold and Production for maintaining as many Towns as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He can turn his Capital into a powerhouse, with all of his towns feeding his central base. On top of he can buy buildings cheaper in Towns, and has access to buying Culture buildings. This can really add up, both giving him immense amounts of Production and Culture, but also saving him money along the way. It’s a nicely rounded style of play with great benefits and an easy-to-understand goal. Just get out there and settle lots of Towns - or take them by force.   </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Confucius </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+25% Growth Rate in Cities.</li><li>+2 Science from Specialists.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Confucius is a master when it comes to expanding his Cities. The natural +25% Growth Rate in Cities is just powerful, especially early on when land-grabbing is important. You can expand your borders much faster than your opponents, absorbing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Best_Resources">key Resources</a> before they can. And you can do it without the pain of going to war. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also has ease becoming one of the best producers of Science in the game thanks to getting +2 Science from Specialists. This can make him particularly potent, especially in the end game where his Specilasits stack up, and he has access to much more advanced Technology than other civilizations. He may need a little help defending his lands, so a strong Civilization pairing, or making a powerful ally can go far. Outside of that though, there’s not a lot that’s going to stop Confucius from gobbling up all the land he can, all while being one of the most technologically advanced. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Xerxes, King of Kings</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+3 Combat Strength for Units that are attacking in neutral or enemy territory.</li><li>Gain 100 Culture and Gold per Age upon capturing a Settlement for the first time. +10% Gold in all Settlements, increased even further in Settlements not founded by you.</li><li>+1 Settlement limit per Age.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Xerxes, King of Kings is as straightforward as it gets. He has one specialty - attacking other players and taking their Settlements. It’s not complicated or highbrowed, but it is undoubtedly effective, especially if you are looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Civ_7_Military_Victory_Guide_and_Best_Leaders">Military Victory</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He benefits from being the aggressor in every situation, getting free combat strength, that doesn’t require anything to activate past initiating fights in foreign territory. He’s also incentivized to take over as many Settlements as his limits will allow, though he even gets a higher Settlement limit. For doing so, not only is he advancing the Military Legacy Path, he gains Culture and Gold further fueling his military aims. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-a-tier-1744891883065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Ashoka, World Renouncer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Food in Cities for every 5 excess Happiness.</li><li>+10% Food in all Settlements during Celebration.</li><li>All buildings gain a +1 Happiness adjacency for all Improvements.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as militarily spooky as the World Conquerer version of Ashoka, the World Renouncer is certainly nothing to sniff at. While the other version is about turning Happiness into military might, this version of Ashoka is all about turning Happiness into population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This changes the play from trying to take over as many Settlements with your units, into going for a land grab and establishing Districts. This can be excellent in the right hands, especially those who know how to manage big populations and city construction. You can also bypass the unrest of taking over Settlements, so there is an argument the World Renouncer is as strong or even stronger. That said, it requires a little more finesse and doesn’t receive the powerful production bonuses. Either way though, as long as your population is happy, your borders should be expanding if you choose to go the World Renouncer route.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Benjamin Franklin</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Science per Age on Production Buildings in CIties.</li><li>+50% Production towards constructing Production Buildings.</li><li>+1 Science per Age active Endeavors you started or supported.</li><li>Can have two Endeavors of the same type active at a time.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Benjamin Franklin is an exceptional and versatile Leader if you intend to go down the Science route in your game. What’s nice is his specialties are in Science and Production, meaning not only can you research a lot of Technology quickly, but you can then make the product of your labor soon after too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His traits create a nice feedback loop around Production Buildings where constructing Production Buildings can be done fast, and he then gets extra Science for each one. He also benefits from having good relations with those around him, and can further his Science generation by entering into Endeavors. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Charlemagne</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Military and Science Buildings receive a Happiness adjacency for Quarters. Gain 2 free Cavalry Units, once unlocked, when entering a Celebration.</li><li>+5 Combat Strength for Cavalry Units during a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Military and Science are always a powerful combination, allowing you to be on the cutting edge of new warfare Technologies, and then pressing that advantage. Charlemagne is encouraged to push for Military and Science buildings to help prop up some powerful Happiness traits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as he can keep his population happy, he can continually enter Celebrations, which in turn gives him free Cavalry Units. While that’s going on too, these already strong early and mid-game units gain even more strength. It’s a very horse-centric strategy, but stampeding over your fellow Civilizations is a very strong tactic in the early parts of the game. While he may struggle more in the Modern Age once the likes of Tanks and Planes are introduced, he should be established with a very strong empire by then. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Harriet Tubman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+100% Influence towards Initiating Espionage Actions.</li><li>Gain 5 War Support on all wars declared against you.</li><li>Units ignore movement penalties from Vegetation.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Harriet Tubman is undoubtedly one of the stealthiest choices in Civilization 7. Influence can be a powerful yield, and Harriet can wield it perhaps most powerfully of all. She can cause some real trouble for other Civilizations by messing with them through means of Espionage, allowing you to disrupt or steal advantages from others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you get caught and anger a powerful force, the 5 War Support you get when a war is declared against you is an enormous drain on them, that should allow you to grind out a victory. On top of that, her armies are nimble, and able to ignore vegetation, making her hard to pin down, tricksy, and a pain to deal with when she’s defending. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Hatshepsut</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Culture for every imported Resource.</li><li>+15% Production towards the construction of Buildings and Wonders in Cities adjacent to Navigable Rivers.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Hatshepsut can get access to really strong spikes in Culture. It benefits her to have good relationships and establish Trade Routes for imported Resources. She gets +1 Culture for each one, so every time she enters into a trade with another civilization, it gives her a nice boost of Culture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’s also one of the very best at producing Wonders, but also, Buildings in general. This makes her very strong in the early Culture Legacy Paths. While she needs to be utilizing a Navigable River, most cities should be on one anyway, so this is not a difficult requirement to satisfy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Himiko, High Shaman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Happiness per Age on Happiness Buildings.</li><li>+50% Production towards constructing Happiness Buildings.</li><li>+20% Culture but -10% Science, and these effects are doubled while in a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Himiko is perhaps the best producer of Culture in Civilization 7. Her traits are very powerful, and the mixture it has with Happiness is a potent one. Constructing Happiness Buildings is fast thanks to the production bonus, and the Happiness Buildings only get stronger with age. She also gets a ridiculous +20% passive boost to Culture, which doubles during Celebrations, further feeding into Happiness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it comes with drawbacks. She also has a -10% passive to Science, which also doubles during a celebration. This will require you to be aware of your handicap and work around it. That said, as long as you either utilize Endeavors or compensate for the Science loss with Buildings and resources, these potential peaks of Culture boosts far outweigh the negative Science nerf. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Isabella</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 300 Gold every time you discover a Natural Wonder, doubled if the Natural Wonder is in Distant Lands.</li><li>+100% additional tile yields from Natural Wonders.</li><li>+50% Gold towards purchasing Naval Units, and -1 Gold maintenance cost for Naval Units.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Isabella can absolutely catapult herself early on if she can find a Natural Wonder. Especially in the Antiquity Age, if found early enough, 300 Gold is a massive boon. This allows her to buy units or buildings that should put her quite a bit ahead if done at the right time. If she is able to incorporate the Natural Wonder into her borders too, she will get massive tile Yields, making it again, very powerful the earlier you can do it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this of course is dependent on your finding and securing the Natural Wonders. She can fall victim to unlucky map placement. If there’s no nearby Natural Wonder early on, then she’s not going to be getting many benefits. That said, no matter what, she should have a strong Navy, by buying water-based Units and maintaining them with no problem.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Jose Rizal</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>When gaining rewards from Narrative Events, gain an additional 20 Culture and Gold per Age.</li><li>Has additional Narrative Events.</li><li>+50% Celebration duration.</li><li>+50% Happiness towards Celebrations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Jose Rizal is a master of Celebrations. The 50% Celebration Duration and +50% Happiness towards Celebrations tandem is very strong. This can help him make massive gains with powerful Celebration effects, especially if he moves in the direction of Culture. He will have Celebrations often and have them active for longer. That’s excellent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also gets nice boosts of Culture and Gold for the Narrative Events he participates in and thankfully they happen more frequently to him than over civs. While these likely won’t sway a game on their own, they are a nice garnish on the Celebration synergy available to him. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Machiavelli</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+3 influence per Age.</li><li>Gains 50 Gold per Age when your Diplomatic Action proposals are accepted or 100 Gold when they are rejected.</li><li>Ignore Relationship requirements for declaring Formal Wars.</li><li>Can Levy Military Units from City-States you are not Suzerin of.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Machiavelli is a great option for those who like to get positively devious. He has a powerful synergy of Influence and Gold that makes him a threat at all times. While he may not be on the offensive every second, his ability to ignore Relationship Requirements to declare wars means even allies aren’t safe from a stab in the back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even his apparent power level can be deceptive, as thanks to his ability to gain a lot of Gold from Diplomatic Actions made with his Influence, he can buy meaningful military force quickly. On top of that, he has the very powerful ability to levy units from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Independent_Powers:_All_Types_and_Bonuses">City-States</a> he isn’t Suzerain of. He’s not best at taking on strong armies and has to be considered in his actions, but he excels at a smash-and-grab playstyle, even at the expense of his friends. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Trung Trac</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 3 free Levels on your first Army Commander.</li><li>+20% Commander experience.</li><li>+10% Science in Cities in Tropical Spaces. This bonus is doubled while in a Formal War you declare.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Trung Trac is the master of utilizing the powerful new Army Commander units. These units let you command multiple units at once while providing them with powerful bonuses. While they aren’t necessarily the strongest to begin with, the more levels they get, the more of a deciding factor they become. Trung Trac not only gets 20% Commander Experience, but her Commanders spawn with three free levels. This can make for some pretty sizeable spikes in military power that can influence wars. If her Commanders get really powerful and get multiple Commendations too, her armies will be some of the most powerful on the map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She also gets a nice boost to Science on Tropical Spaces, a whopping 20% boostwhen at war, supercharging the formidable Science and Military combo. That said, it’s map-dependent, as she will need access to those Tropical tiles. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Xerxes, The Achaemenid</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Trade Route limit with all other leaders.</li><li>+50 Culture and 100 Gold per Age when you create a Trade Route or Road.</li><li>+1 Culture and Gold per Age on Unique Buildings and Unique Improvements.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Xerxes, The Achaemenid has access to a nice variety of yields and benefits. The 100 Gold and 50 Culture he gets from creating Trade Routes and Roads are excellent and can provide you with massive spikes of both if you set up multiple around the same time. Considering he gets access to one extra Trade Route too for each Leader, there is a nice synergy here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s only helped by his buff to Culture and Gold on Unique Buildings and Improvements. Make no mistake, this is a massive amount of both, and when utilized properly, it’s very, very strong. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">B-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-b-tier-1744891910688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Amina</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Resource Capacity in Cities.</li><li>+1 Gold per Age for each Resource assigned to Cities.</li><li>+5 Combat Strength on all Units in Plains or Desert.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Amina is definitely a decent Leader who does well with Resources. Resources are powerful in Civilization 7, so having access to more is not a bad thing. While the +1 capacity is nice to have, the +1 Gold per Age for each Resource assigned to Cities is an excellent Gold generator. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you will need to get access to as many Resources as possible while housing them too, so that is where your game plan should be focused. Her Units getting a +5 Combat Strength on all Units in Plains or Desert is a bit situational, but it could come in clutch in the right circumstances. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Catherine the Great</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Culture per Age on displayed Great Works. Building with Great Works slot gain 1 additional slot.</li><li>Cities settled in Tundra gain Science equal to a percentage of their Culture per turn.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Catherine the Great is generally a great producer of Culture. Displaying Great Works is a part of the Culture Legacy Path, so her getting access to extra slots to display them can be useful when trying to run through that as fast as possible. The Culture boost for doing so will also feed more Great Works, making a nice feedback loop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, she can be a little situational. Her cities being on Tundra do make for excellent Science output in tandem with her Culture generation. That said, if you can’t settle on Tundras or their barrenness ends up hurting you in terms of resources, she can be a little trickier to utilize. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Friedrich, Oblique</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Army Commanders start with the Merit Commendation, granting them additional Command Radius. </li><li>Gain an Infantry Unit when you construct a Science Building.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Oblique version of Friedrich is likely his better option, though he’s still far from the best in the game. That isn’t to say he isn’t without merit though. Army Commanders are strong Units and the Merit Commendations provide the most powerful effects among them. Starting with one of those is a good way to boost your army's power early on. The additional Command Radius is as powerful as any buffs and debuffs, allowing you to affect more Units. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also can get an Infantry Unit when constructing a Science Building, which is a nice incentive to put your Gold and Production into those. That said, he has no access to Science, Influence, or Culture buffs. Even for a scientific-focused Civilization, he can end up hurting his viability a bit as he will likely lag behind other specialists. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Ibn Battuta</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 2 Wildcard Attribute Points after the first Civic in every Age.</li><li>+1 Sight for all Units.</li><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Trade Maps that allows you to gradually see other Leaders’ Explored area.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Ibn Battuta could become a powerful Civilization if played correctly, though he is so versatile, his strengths may not be apparent to those not sure how to utilize Attribute Points. Getting 2 of these after the first Civic in each Age means that he is flexible, and can spec himself into the situation he finds himself in. That said, with that flexibility comes more choice and complexity that might be a little unwieldy for new players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, his visibility of the map granted from stealing other Explored areas and the extra sight from units is something that can be powerful in experienced hands. However that value might not be apparent to those less versed in how to make use of that information. He brings a lot to the table and is very flexible. Just be sure you know how to utilize that. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Lafayette</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Reform, which grants an additional Social Policy slot. Supporting this Endeavor also grants the other leader an additional Social Policy Slot.</li><li>+1 Combat Strength for every Tradition, but not Policy, slotted into Government.</li><li>+1 Culture and Happiness per Age in Settlements, doubled in Distant Lands.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Lafayette has access to some nice traits, though they aren’t the most eye-catching in isolation. Him being able to use Reform to get additional Social Policy Slots is nice, and can help provide yield boosts. The +1 Combat Strength he gets from Traditions too is nothing to sniff at. That said, even with yield-focused policies, he may struggle to keep up with more specialised Leaders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The +1 to Culture and Happiness per Age, which is doubled in Distant Lands, is a completely unconditional buff though. That’s nice to have. This all comes together to make him a good Civilization, with a nice selection of good traits, though nothing here is entirely compelling here on its own. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Napoleon, Emperor</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Sanction called Continental System that reduces the Trade Route limit of the targeted Leader to all other Leaders. Causes massive Relationship penalty, and costs more to reject.</li><li>+8 Gold per Age for every Leader you are Unfriendly or Hostile with.</li><li>Can reject endeavors for Free.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Napoleon, Emperor is for those who like being a bit of a brat. He gets benefits from being a troll, gaining a very good +8 Gold for every Leader he is Unfriendly or Hostile with. That can be a lot if he’s annoying everyone. His Continental System Sanction messes with other civilizations’ ability to trade, making it an excellent option to tick off his neighbors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty comes in managing that dislike. This means it will be very hard to enter into Endeavors, or even keep Open Borders with those around you. Of course, it will also paint an enormous target on your back. Since he provides no buffs to his Units militarily, that’s a dangerous game. So, if you’re going to be a jerk to everyone, make sure you have the army to back it up just in case the consequences of your actions catch up to you. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Napoleon, Revolutionary</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Movement for all Land Units.</li><li>Defending an enemy unit provides Culture equal to 50% percent of its Combat Strength.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Napoleon, Revolutionary is an interesting Leader. All of his land units get +1 movement which is helpful when trying to both traverse large areas, as well as being nimble when maneuvering around enemy units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, how you utilize his other trait is likely going to be what decides if you do well with him or not. Culture equal to 50% of enemy Combat Strength when defending can be very spikey, giving you a lot of Culture if you find yourself defending multiple times per turn. However, to make the best of this, you need to find yourself in this position relatively often. That means you’re going to want to be provoking enemies, but holding your ground. It’s a pretty unique playstyle and may be a bit awkward for some. But if used well, it could be a big source of Culture. Just expect to be putting other resources into maintaining your army as you continually take hits. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Tecumseh</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Food and Production per Age in Settlements for every City-State you are Suzerain of.</li><li>+1 Combat Strength for all your Units for every City-State you are Suzerin of.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Tecumseh has the potential to be very good, but it will need time and setup. He is all about becoming the Suzerain of City-States. If you can rack up three or four of these, that’s a significant bonus to Food and Production, as well as Combat Strength.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue is that becoming a Suzerain takes a lot of Influence and he doesn’t have an inherent trait that helps. So he will need a good pairing with a Civilization, Policy, and Buildings/Districts to facilitate this. On top of that, it will just take time for you to get the Influence you need and convince these states they should come under your wing. However, if you have the infrastructure for it, the rewards can be pure and consistent value. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Himiko, Queen of Wa</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Friend of Wei that can be performed in an Alliance to grant you and your ally +25% Science.</li><li>+4 Science per Age for every Leader you are Friendly or Helpful with.</li><li>Can support Endeavors for free.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Himiko, Queen of Wa is the opposite of Napoleon, Emperor. She is all about being everyone’s best friend, and if you can maintain that, you will reap enormous benefits. The +4 Science per Age for every Leader you’re Friendly or Helpful with is only helped by the Friend of Wei Endeavor. Multiply that by several allies, and that’s serious Science production. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, you do have to be a little careful with it too. Make sure being nice to everyone doesn’t come at the cost of your defensive military. Your Technological advances and sunny demeanor may make others jealous, so don’t get caught out thinking everyone is your friend. That can go out the window quickly when they want what you have. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">C-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-c-tier-1744891945200.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Friedrich, Baroque</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a Great Work when you capture a Settlement for the first time. </li><li>Gain an Infantry Unit when you construct a Culture Building.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Friedrich, Baroque has two traits and neither is particularly strong or distinct. Gaining a Great Work for capturing a Settlement for the first time is decent, but is unlikely to outright help you win games. In a field of very strong Leader traits, this feels merely ‘fine’. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaining an Infantry Unit when building a Culture Building is also useful, and can help fuel your military ambitions, but it’s not exactly going to make up for having no yield bonuses here. There are just many stronger options when it comes to Culture and your Military. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Pachacuti</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>All Buildings gain a +1 Food adjacency bonus for Mountains. </li><li>Specialists adjacent to Mountains do not cost Happiness maintenance</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Pachacuti is not a bad Leader. In fact, in some games, he can be exceptional. The problem is, he can also do next to nothing if the map hasn’t favored you. To excel, you need Mountains. If he can settle near them, then he will get good access to a good amount of Food and have little drawback from Specialists. That can be really good, especially when paired with Civilizations that utilize Mountains too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, that’s a strict requirement. Without Mountains, he provides little else, so if you spawn on a map with none around you, you’re out of luck. Of course, you can start over, or move the map sliders in your favor before picking him, but if you want a neutral experience where you start and play on a normal map, know you’re rolling the dice when you start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

Instead, the developer told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a> that it's "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" for the upcoming hybrid system.</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar stayed mum about anything regarding an update for The Witcher 3 on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. Downar explained that when they learned about Nintendo's new console, Cyberpunk 2077 came to mind first. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">The sci-fi RPG was confirmed for Switch 2</a> at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">system's Nintendo Direct</a> earlier this month. It wasn't previously available on Switch like The Witcher 3. </p><p dir="ltr">"It's incredibly exciting to be a launch title for this new hardware," Downar said. "Alongside all the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive features--like motion controls, gyroscope implementation, the mouse sensor, and more--we can't wait to see how the community explores the game in new ways."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="333463710" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

who might have bought the game outright. Kingsley said he agrees that this may be true "a little bit" because he believes many Game Pass subscribers are "hardcore" gamers who might be inclined to buy a new IP like Atomfall.</p><p>However, "What you gain from that cost is disproportionate," he said.</p><p>Kingsley went on to say that Game Pass can help a game like Atomfall because people might try it and then tell their friends about it.

So, they'll go and buy it," he said.</p><p>At least, that's what Kingsley thinks. He admitted, "We don't have the data in for that." But in any event, Kingsley said one of the challenges Rebellion faces is "discovery," so taking a deal with Microsoft for Atomfall to come to Game Pass "has allowed for a lot of discovery for our game."</p><p>It appears to have worked out for Rebellion, as Atomfall enjoyed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-release-atomfall-is-devs-most-successful-game-in-32-years/1100-6530519/" data-ref-id="1100-6530519">"most successful launch"</a> in Rebellion's 32-year history.</p><p>Atomfall wasn't Rebellion's first day-one Game Pass release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance, which was also released in 2025, came to Game Pass at launch.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has shared a fresh 15-minute look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in a dedicated Nintendo Direct stream. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive kart racing sequel is coming out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">alongside the new console on 5th June</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct – 17/04/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Cze7usEGCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct gave us a deeper dive into what this new entry in the long-running karting series will offer. From the game reveal a couple weeks ago we already learned about the larger 24-player races, the shift to an open world that’s filled with race circuits that you actually race between as part of many Grand Prix events, the new Knockout Tour mode, and plenty more.</p>
<p>There were also plenty of teases in the trailer, subsequent Treehouse Live showcase and hands on events, such as snacking on food to unlock new character costumes – they transform you mid-race but are then unlocked for the rest of the game – rail grinding and wall-jumping, new water vehicle transformations, the ability to commandeer some world vehicles, and more.</p>
<p>The Direct runs through the basics, such as picking characters and karts, each of which combines to give different stats for when you head out on track, much like in Mario Kart 8, the structure of Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, the menagerie of items new and old, and plenty more. There’s new additions like Kamek, who can transform rivals, and, yup, you’ll still get the more powerful items when you’re towards the back.</p>

<p>Similar to Mario Kart 8, newer players can use smart steering to help stay on track, or tilt controls (including with a Joy-Con 2 wheel) to make things harder. New features when racing include the Charge Jump – hold the drift button while going straight to jump up – which is great for dodging incoming attacks, hopping up onto grind rails and wall-riding. You can also Rewind, to roll your position back and let you redo a stretch of a race, perhaps to master a particular trick or jump – other drivers are not rewound though, so don’t use this too much or you’ll end up dead last!</p>
<p>Beyond Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, a standalone custom race you have more control over the race you take part in. You can choose to race a particular track three times round in as is standard, or do a point-to-point race style by racing from one track to another. This even lets you create races that you don’t get to experience in the main game modes.</p>
<p>Battle mode has also been confirmed with a showdown where you have five balloon lives, use items to try and knock out other players’ lives, and the last player standing (driving?) wins.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring the open world in Free Roam, you can look out for P switches that will start particular missions while driving around, such as collecting blue coins or heading to checkpoints.</p>
<p>The game supports four player split-screen multiplayer and up to eight players in local wireless play, while up to 24 players is limited to online play. Here you can party up with friends while free roaming – meet up with your crew in the world map and then cruise around together, battle and race.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game at the first Switch 2 hands on event earlier this month, and had a great time checking out the expanded races, the point-to-point Knockout Tour, seeing all the new characters and falling in love with the ability to race as Cow.</p>

<p>Chatting about the Knockout Tour, I said, “Knockout Tour is one long cross-country race, with checkpoints to blaze a trail towards and the final four drivers to reach that point being eliminated. From twenty-four racers at the start, it will chop the field down to just four by the time you’re racing for the win. It ramps up the pressure in a very different way, and the sheer number of players, the volume of pickups going off makes for some seriously topsy-turvy moments as you tumble from 5th to 19th and the cusp of getting completely knocked out as you come to the next time gate.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation in which the Japanese gaming giant showed off more gameplay details for the upcoming racer&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>Set to debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>represents the first entirely new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game since 2014's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and Nintendo has packed in a fair few new features to reflect that. Here's everything covered during today's show!</p>

<hr><h2>New and returning courses in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>First, we got a look at some of the courses that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As you'd expect, there will be a number of new courses on offer, as well as several returning favorites.</p>

<p>New courses include the canyon-set Mario Bros. Circuit, the urban Crown City, and the spooky movie theater Boo Cinema, while returning courses include the likes of Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=Nuyuz6bd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=LcFAosad 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has a number of new courses to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed at the time of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">original announcement</a>, these courses will be integrated into a fully-explorable world, and you'll need to drive between them when you're racing in certain modes.</p>

<h2>New and returning racers in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>Several new characters will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s lineup. They include the likes of the series' iconic Goomba, as well as a cloudless Lakitu, New Donk City mayor Pauline, and more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to certain characters making a return; Mario and Luigi are givens, and Peach, Bowser, and many others will be coming back to race in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose which vehicle you want to use while racing, and each vehicle has different stats, as do the characters themselves. It doesn't look like you'll be choosing individual parts for your vehicles this time around, though.</p>

<h2><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s many gameplay modes</h2>

<p>We also got a look at the gameplay modes that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As has been previously revealed, the two main modes on offer are Grand Prix and Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The former works like a classic&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>Grand Prix mode; you'll race across four courses, and the winner is the racer who accrues the most points, although you will also be driving between courses now.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour, meanwhile, tasks you with placing ahead of other racers to avoid being eliminated. Several different sets of courses will be available for both modes. Of course, classic multiplayer staples like VS Race and Battle Mode will also be available.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s Free Roam mode is exactly what it sounds like; you'll be exploring the game's world, finding hidden switches and panels to take on missions. Nintendo didn't reveal whether the missions will unlock any extra stuff, but they should be a fun way to hone your racing skills.</p>

<h2>New items and gameplay tricks</h2>

<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will introduce a number of new items you can use to get one over on your racing rivals. They include the Mega Mushroom, which lets you grow to a massive size and stomp your enemies, and the Hammer, which you can throw to create obstacles on the course.</p>

<p>These will, of course, accompany returning items like Bullet Bill and the Lightning powerup, although I don't think I spotted the iconic Blue Shell during the Direct. Hopefully, it'll be making some kind of return; a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game with no Blue Shell is no&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=BiE6FsY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=EDY9_yO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new powerups for you to try.</figcaption></figure><p>These items will be accompanied by plenty of new gameplay tricks, including wall-riding, grinding on rails, and Charge Jumping, which lets you hold the Drift button while racing straight to charge up a jump. You can then use that jump to dodge projectiles and other hazards.</p>

<p>We also got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s drive-thru Yoshi's, which will let you collect food items in order to unlock new outfits. You can then select these outfits on the character selection screen.</p>

<p>Several support features will be available, too, including smart steering and auto-acceleration, which you can use to level the playing field if you're experiencing&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>alongside franchise newbies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the Rewind feature, which lets you rewind yourself to a point before making a mistake. It only works on the racer using it, though, so be aware of that if you're using it tactically.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during today's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>Direct show! The game is due to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th.</p>

There’s an outbreak, we cut to years later when only a few survive, then follow a small band of survivors who get stuck on the roof of a mall. I think that’s about 90 percent of them. Which is why the complete weirdness featured in the latest trailer for <em>28 Years Later</em> is so incredibly welcome.</p><p>One of the greatest TV shows ever made was Damon Lindelof’s 2014 series <em>The Leftovers</em>. Where many shows have previously covered the territory of large numbers of people mysteriously vanishing, In <em>The Leftovers</em>, two percent of the Earth’s population inexplicably vanished in a single moment. The program was set two years later, focusing on a small New York community, exploring the repercussions of this event. And it was <em>weird</em>. It was rooted in the unknown, in the lack of an explanation, and the consequences on society, whether it was the formation of deeply peculiar cults, or the personal trauma of losing loved ones. But also, other stuff: dogs were turning feral, deer became less timid, and there was this one waterfall...</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I bring this up because it’s that same vibe of humanity’s spiraling into strangeness that seems most key to this new footage from <em>28 Years Later</em>. Rather than exploring the horror of the immediate zombie apocalypse, here director Danny Boyle seems to be using the three-decades-on approach to envisage a society that’s known little else, and the bizarre, uncomfortable, and spiritual effects this has had on people. Plus, you know, people running away from brain-hungry undeads.</p><p>The movie is out on June 20, so there’s still a fair amount of waiting to do.

    <p><span>All the latest information on the "biggest Mario Kart ever."</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,859 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250416860422/en/" target="_blank">shared</a> new information for <em><a title="Games > Mario Kart World [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></em> during a dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast today, introducing the “biggest <em>Mario Kart</em> ever” by showcasing its Grand Prix races, Knockout Tours, Battle Mode, Free Roam, and more. <span id="more-959136"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> features a series-first: an interconnected world where you can drive virtually anywhere, including across cities, plains, a desert and even the ocean. Races are held throughout this world’s various regions and feature dynamic weather conditions and a day / night cycle. Start your engines and compete for first place in Grand Prix or the new Knockout Tour mode or simply experience a leisurely drive across a world of diverse locales in Free Roam. The world is your racetrack, and there’s plenty to discover—solo or with friends, locally or online. This is just the starting line!</p><p>Read below for more information about everything featured:</p><ul><li><strong>An Interconnected World</strong> – Drift, draft and drive your way around an interconnected world for the first time in a Mario Kart game. In <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game’s courses are interspersed across the world with roads leading from one to the next – so players can experience navigating roads in between courses!</li><li><strong>Grand Prix</strong> – Bring home the gold in Grand Prix, which consists of four different races to win each Cup – including the Mushroom</li><li><strong>Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, and More</strong> – Held across the game’s world. And for the first time in the series, racers will need to drive from one course to the next as part of the Grand Prix! In Mushroom Cup, for example, you’ll start off <a title="Genres > Racing [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> the Mario Bros. Circuit, then the second race will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City. Conquer every Grand Prix Cup and you might just unlock a certain colorful course!</li><li><strong>Knockout Tour</strong> – Race from one end of the world to the other in these extended rallies, with checkpoints dotted throughout. If you don’t make the cut, you’re out of the running, so buckle up for these non-stop sprints because you’ll need to keep pace to stay in the race. Your rivals aren’t the only hazards you’ll need to avoid on the road, either. Vehicles that shoot Bullet Bills, Hammer Bros. attacks, and other obstacles will find their way into this mode as well. Drive to survive and keep your eyes on first place!</li><li><strong>Free Roam</strong> – There is plenty to discover in <em>Mario Kart World</em> that goes beyond racing. So when you’re not aiming for first place, take the scenic route in Free Roam! Explore panoramic vistas, go (way) off-road, see the seas and find secrets like hidden coins, or hit P Switches to take on hundreds of missions that can help improve your driving skills outside of races. You can also take in-game photos while free roaming, so take a road trip and strike a pose at the sights.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_959205"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Battle Mode</strong> – Battle Mode is back and more hectic than ever! Secure the gold by collecting the most coins in Coin Runners or burst your rivals’ balloons with items in Balloon Battle. If you pop all of your rival’s balloons, they are out!</li><li><strong>New Techniques</strong> – Leap over obstacles and more with the new Charge Jump move. Use it to jump onto rails that you can grind, dodge attacks from your rivals and even jump toward a wall to ride on it for a short time. You can also chain together wall-rides to uncover hidden routes. Miss your mark during Free Roam or single-player mode? Just use Rewind to reset your vehicle to its original position—this is a great way to undo a driving mishap, but keep in mind that your rivals will still move normally while rewinding, so try not to lose your lead!</li><li><strong>24 Racers</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> features races with up to 24 participants from around the world – the most in Mario Kart series history! Modes like Grand Prix and Knockout Tour allow up to 24 players to compete, filling the game world with friends and familiar faces and plenty of rivals to vie for first place.</li><li><strong>Fun With Everyone, Anywhere</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> offers multiple ways to play together, locally or online. Up to four players can race split screen on the same system. The game also supports local wireless play where up to eight players (with up to two players per Nintendo <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [103 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> system) can race together. And players from around the world can join a race or battle in online play. In Free Roam, you can also meet up with your crew anywhere in this game’s world. Drive around, see where your friends are on the map and warp to them instantly. Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.</li><li><strong>Even More Fun with GameChat</strong> – GameChat features an expanded online experience in the <em>Mario Kart World</em> game. Use the Nintendo Switch 2 built-in microphone to voice chat with friends while driving together or take a backseat and watch each other’s game screens. You can enjoy GameChat without needing a Nintendo Switch Online membership until March 31, 2026. After that, a Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required.</li><li><strong>CameraPlay</strong> – If you have a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera (sold separately)***, your face will show up beside your racer, and you can see your friends’ reactions when you play online! When playing locally with family and friends on the same system, a single camera can detect up to four people’s faces that you can see in-game as well.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> has many races to enjoy across its vast world. Rule the roads on brand new courses like Mario Bros. Circuit, the modern streets of Crown City, the snowy trails of Starview Peak and the spirited Boo Cinema, just to name a few. Nostalgic courses from previous Mario Kart games have also been reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics.</li><li><strong>Characters</strong> – Get behind the wheel as familiar Mushroom Kingdom characters like Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser. Looking for a racer that’s a little more offbeat? Try taking Goomba, Spike and even Cow for a test drive.</li><li><strong>New Items</strong> – Tear up the track with a selection of new and returning items. Throw a Coin Shell to knock rivals off course and make coins appear that gradually increase the speed of whoever collects them. Chill out the competition (and send ’em spinning) with the Ice Flower. Bring down the Hammer to nail your rival or briefly block their path. Use a Mega Mushroom to grow big and squash your rivals. Leap to new heights with the Feather. Call in Kamek’s magic to transform your rivals into something surprising and cause unexpected chaos on the course. The lower your position, the more likely you’ll receive items that could turn the tables, so when you get something good … go for it!</li><li><strong>Drive-Thru and Roll-Out</strong> – Make a pit stop at Yoshi’s for a local delight – Dash Food! These to-go orders will give you a speed boost and sometimes also unlock outfits that can be donned from the character selection screen. There are plenty of dishes and outfits to find, so drive through when making your way around <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</li><li><strong>Even More Modes</strong> – Whether you want to race or battle, there are even more ways to stoke some friendly competition in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Race against the clock in Time Trials, where players can also go online to compete against ghost data from racers around the world. And you can customize the rules of the road in VS Race, where drivers can decide if they want to compete with two, three or four teams with a classic three-lap ruleset or by driving from one course to another.</li><li><strong>Roadside Assistance</strong> – Looking for some options to assist you on race day? Features like Smart Steering to keep you on course, Auto-Accelerate and Tilt Controls for motion control steering are available to turn on or off whenever you like. Plus, if you have the Joy-Con 2 Wheel accessory (available as a set of two, sold separately) you can feel like you’re really driving!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is due out for Switch 2 on June 5 alongside Switch 2.</p><p>Watch the <em>Mario Kart World</em> Direct archive below.

                <p>Nintendo teased that Rainbow Road will return in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>, although it'll be unlocked in a surprising way.</p><p>The tease game partway through Mario Kart World's Nintendo Direct, as Nintendo provided an overview of all the different courses the game has to offer and its Grand Prix mode. Toward the end of this segment, the narrator teased that "if you conquer all Grand Prix cups, rumor has it that a certain colorful course will appear." As they say that, we see an object leaving behind a rainbow-colored streak flying into the air.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Nintendo did not directly say the course's name, it's clear that Rainbow Road is what it's referring to. Rainbow Road stands as the most iconic Mario Kart course. First appearing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-17690">Super Mario Kart</a>, it has since been reimagined for every Mario Kart game since and has a reputation for always being one of the tougher courses in the game. Typically, Rainbow Road has just been part of a four-course cup, but this time around, it looks like Rainbow Road will be the grand reward for acing Mario Kart World's Grand Prix mode.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5. It will be part of a $500 bundle with the console or available separately for $80.

            <p>Nintendo has essentially confirmed in all but name that Rainbow Road will indeed be part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the game's release this summer.</p>
<p>However, while Rainbow Road is a part of the upcoming Mario Kart title, it isn't going to be available to zip around from the off. Rather, players will need to "conquer" all Grand Prix cups. Then, so says Nintendo, "rumour has it a certain colourful course will appear".</p>
<p>So, yep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">that'll be Rainbow Road</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-mario-kart-world-direct-live-watch-here">Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct this afternoon</a> showing a colourful beam leading up to the sky above.</p>

</figure>
<p>Other courses confirmed for Mario Kart World include the all new icy Starview Peak and the spoooooky Boo Cinema, as well as returning series entries like Toad's Factory, Peach Beach and Wario's Galleon.</p>
<p>Here are the Mario Kart World courses confirmed this afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario's Galleon</li>
</ul>
<p>On the characters side of things, we will of course be able to play as Mario - this is his series after all - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">new racers like Cow</a>, Spike and Goomba (Ed and I want to know how he drives without arms. And, while we are on it, I still have questions about King Boo's driving abilities).</p>
<p>These drivers will be able to use new items, such as Kamek. Yes, Kamek is an item, and his magic will "transform" your racing rivals into, at least as far as today's Direct has shown us, Chargin' Chucks - those large burly Koopas in football gear. "What other mysterious effects will happen," Nintendo teased in today's showcase. I don't know Nintendo, I don't know!</p>
<p>Here are some of the Items confirmed for Mario Kart World, with some returning favourites as well as some newbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coin Shell (makes coins appear)</li>
<li>Ice Flower (freeze your rivals and send them spinning)</li>
<li>Hammer (embrace your inner Hammer Bro)</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom (go big or go home)</li>
<li>Feather (handy for avoiding attacks)</li>
<li>Kamek (see above)</li>
<li>Bullet Bill (blast through the ranks)</li>
<li>Lightning (zap your racing rivals)</li>
</ul>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's more! Here are the various modes and battles coming to Mario Kart World: </p>
<ul>
<li>Time Trials</li>
<li>VS Race</li>
<li>Teams</li>
<li>	Free Roam</li>
<li>Balloon Battle</li>
<li>Coin Runners</li>
</ul>
<p>"Battle Mode is back and more hectic than ever! Burst your rivals' balloons with items in Balloon Battle or secure the gold by collecting the most coins in Coin Runners," reads the Battle Mode's official blurb from Nintendo. "And this time around, if you pop all of your rival’s balloons, they are out!"</p>
<p>Nintendo also promises plenty to explore thanks to Mario Kart World's Free Roam. "Explore panoramic vistas, go (way) off-road, see the seas and find secrets like hidden coins, or hit P Switches to take on hundreds of missions that can help improve your driving skills outside of races," it says. Hundreds of missions, Nintendo. My!</p>
<p>The Mario Kart World team reiterated that players can also take in-game photos while free roaming, "so take a road trip and strike a pose at the sights".</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next up, we have Mario Kart World's support features, handy for those new to the series or for those who, like my god children, are too small to actually be able to control what's going on but still want to be part of the fun.</p>
<p>These features include Smart Steering (often needed when small humans are involved), Auto-Accelerate and Auto-Use Item. There are also Tilt Controls, which are compatible with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s Joy-Con wheel.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will also have new tricks. There's Charge Jump, which can be used while holding the drift button while driving straight ahead. These jumps can enable racers to jump over obstacles such as an oncoming vehicle, "grind along powerlines", and move out of the way of an oncoming rival attack such as a green shell. This jump will also allow the jumper to wall ride for a bit should they jump towards a wall (obviously).</p>
<p>Another new trick arriving with Mario Kart World is Rewind, which does exactly as it says on the tin. Racers can rewind the action, but - and this is important - only for them. Other racers will still be charging ahead as normal.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Mario-Kart-World-Dolphin-on-a-Dolphin-bike.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, if hunger strikes when playing Mario Kart World, there is the option to "make a pit stop" for some grub. Dash Food, as this is known, is some to-go orders that will give players "a speed boost and sometimes also unlock outfits that can be donned from the character selection screen". Nintendo promises a large selection of dishes and outfits to discover on the game's release.</p>
<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p>

			<p>Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds launched a rather stomach-churning 12 years ago, a game which I’m sure many have fond memories of, playing with friends, enjoying its silly enemies and simple action. I’m sorry to say that, given the wealth of newer beat ’em ups released since then, it’s not held up all that well. But what’s this? A remaster? Can spruced up graphics and some gameplay tweaks save the day?</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKWLg6wW6k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is now the version of the day, a remaster of the original game with added characters and moved into Unreal Engine 5, so things are shinier, and you’ve got more options in the co-op and versus mode. I do like that the online co-op lets you play with up to six players, which can potentially lead to pure chaos on screen.</p>


<p>The versus mode feels a bit tacked on in games like this, and that’s especially true here as the combat mechanics just aren’t deep enough to make you want to keep hopping in and testing yourself against your friends. To say that most of the combat here is button-mashing would be vastly underselling the amount of button-mashing you can do in Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate.</p>


<p>Technically, you’ve got light, medium, heavy, and special attacks, along with a few movement options and some ultimates as well. In most levels though, you’ll be just hammering one of those wondering when things are about to end. Despite this, there’s fun to be had here because of the incredibly odd enemy design and the generally good feeling of levelling up, but it’s short-lived. If you’re playing alone, you’re most likely going to lose interest pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It’s all just a bit flat, and the story, despite being completely unhinged and involving dimensional travel, isn’t especially inspiring either. It’s all slightly better-looking and it runs smoother than it used to, but unless you’re an absolutely rabid die-hard fan of the original game, that’s really not enough to pit it against more modern takes on the beat ’em up genre like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a>.</p>

<p>I really wanted to enjoy this game more than I did. Reviewing a game you’re excited about but then don’t get on with is, frankly, rubbish. All that excitement just sort of ends up disappearing into the void, and instead of getting a nice pay-off, you get a bit of sadness. It’s not great, you know? Despite my best efforts though, I just couldn’t enjoy this game.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is a renewed take on a beat 'em up that probably felt a little outdated back when it launched in 2012, and while the revamped graphics and the engine are both nice, they're not enough to make this feel like a game that's really worth sinking your time into. It's a fun five minutes or so here and there, but it's just not doing enough to really make it an enjoyable time.	</p></div>

			<p>NVIDIA announced that its cloud streaming platform GeForce NOW was updated with 11 PC games this week. The highlights are undoubtedly Hunt: Showdown 1896 and Forever Skies.</p>
<p>The former is Crytek's popular horror-themed extraction shooter. Originally released in 2019, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-launched</a> in August 2024 with several updates to the CryEngine version. The game now supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available via GeForce NOW if you have a premium subscription, DirectX 12, HDR displays, multi-bounce global illumination, and more. Earlier this year, Crytek <a href="https://wccftech.com/crytek-lays-off-15-of-its-400-employees-will-focus-on-expanding-hunt-showdown-1896-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> a substantial (15%) portion of its workforce. Development of a new Crysis game was put on hold, but Hunt: Showdown 1896 continues to be regularly updated due to its healthy player base. A new DLC called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3415590/Hunt_Showdown_1896__Last_of_the_Herd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last of the Herd</a> is due to be released soon, adding the Plains Warden playable character and a new Hunting Bow, the Herd Thinner.</p>

Update 1.0 added the final chapter of the game's story, new points of interest and biomes to explore, new colossal creatures, new collections (artifacts and murals) and cosmetic rewards, new tools, resources, and crafting recipes, various quality of live improvements, and improved performance including NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (available on GeForce NOW for Ultimate tier subscribers).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-royal-writ-is-a-permadeath-deckbuilder-from-yogscast-games.1166691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yogscast Games and developer Save Sloth Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>, a lane-based deckbuilder with an extra sting in its tail for those who like their difficulty a little higher.</p>

<p>The game sees you marching your troops across a series of procedurally-generated maps in order to defeat the final boss and emerge from your run victorious. So far, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow">so deckbuilder</a>, but there's a twist to this one.</p>

<p>If your cards arrive at their destination and the enemy base still has health remaining, then those cards will be permanently deleted from your deck for that run, so you'll have to make clever decisions about which cards to send and which ones to reserve.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=03QgPM-N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=KaiRZV30 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>has an extra sting in its tail thanks to card permadeath.</figcaption></figure><p>Save Sloth and Yogscast say the permadeath mechanic in&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is all part of the point; the system is designed to create "the ultimate jeopardy", leading to "emergent sub-stories" and "memorable" individual runs.</p>

<p>The studios say the point is either to "achieve victory through strategic planning or game-breaking synergies", or to "fail miserably because your soldier got stuck in a bog and you forgot he can't fly". We've all been there.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in "cute picture-book visuals" that emphasize the "grotesque and absurd humor of a medieval world engulfed in constant war and deceit".</p>

<p>Development on&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>began as part of game jam competition Ludum Dare 55, and following "hugely positive feedback", the game moved into full development. You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>'s debut trailer here.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but if you'd like to give the game a go, a playable demo will be available "soon", according to Yogscast and Save Sloth.</p>

Now, the sale is seemingly live, but it shows on my Xbox console that these deals will end later tonight, as if the limited preview is still happening. But most of these 900+ games on sale are new deals that weren’t part of the preview. So what’s happening? I don’t know. I assume Xbox will sort this all soon enough. </p><p>Previously, spring sales at Xbox have wrapped up after two weeks, so I’d expect this one to follow a similar pattern.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-revenue-dips-in-2024-lost-records-sales-in-line-with-forecasts.1166664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial statement for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking a little gloomy for the French studio.</p>

<p>The statement shows that revenues are down significantly; operating revenues fell by 25% to&nbsp;€23.9 million, as compared to 2023's&nbsp;€32.1 million figure. CEO Oskar Guilbert says this year's performance reflects games that "fell short of our expectations" despite "a very positive critical reception".</p>

<p>Despite the revenue drop, Don't Nod says sales were up 14% on last year, largely driven by the studio's back catalog, as well as 2023's&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and early 2024's&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">both games underperformed by the studio's standards</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Xx9xNHlH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Z8Arhvcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's revenues were down in 2024, but sales were up.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Don't Nod, future sales for&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>are "not expected to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full development costs", which essentially means both games have made a loss.</p>

<p>Additionally, the "temporary suspension" of the as-yet unannounced projects P12 and P13, as well as the full cancellation of projects P10 and P14 (these are all internal codenames, of course), led to further losses for Don't Nod.</p>

<p>With all of this said, you might be wondering how the studio's most recent release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, is performing. Don't Nod doesn't provide sales figures for the game, but it does say sales are "in line with forecasts in an increasingly selective market".</p>

<p>The studio also points to the "critical acclaim" for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>, which is reflected by the game's Metacritic average and Steam review score. Our own Tyler was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow">reasonably impressed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=yEUuTznW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=kP3ux33x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>is performing according to Don't Nod's expectations.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of Don't Nod's future, the only major project on the studio's slate right now is&nbsp;<em>The Lonesome Guild</em>, a publishing effort that's being developed by Italian outfit Tiny Bull Studios. That's scheduled for release in late 2025.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is preventing some users from accessing sensitive content unless they allow the platform to verify their age by scanning their face or ID. The new age verification process is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group#h_01JQ4N4R4K238K45JTARQVK2CN">described as an “experiment” by Discord</a>, and is being trialed in the United Kingdom and Australia in response to local laws that require online platforms to have guardrails in place for safeguarding children.</p><p>The new face and ID scanning requirements only apply to Discord users who haven’t previously verified their age on the platform. Discord says this is a “one-time process” that will be triggered in two situations: when users are exposed to nude or sexually explicit content that’s been flagged by Discord’s sensitive media filter, or when users attempt to change filter control settings to prevent such content from being blurred or blocked. </p><p>An age verification window will then appear that prompts the user to either allow Discord to access their device camera and scan their face, or submit a photograph of their ID by scanning a QR code via their phone.</p><p>Discord is likely trialing this process to appease new laws in the UK and Australia that aim to restrict children from accessing sensitive material online. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23922397/uk-online-safety-bill-law-passed-royal-assent-moderation-regulation">UK’s Online Safety Act</a> requires online platforms that may host pornographic content to introduce “robust” age-checking techniques, while <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o">Australia is requiring that under-16s</a> be prevented from accessing social media platforms entirely. We have asked Discord if it has any plans to roll out its experimental age verification process in other regions.</p><p>Discord is placing a surprising amount of trust in the accuracy of the face scanning tool, given some users may be banned if the process decides they look too young to be using the platform. Discord says that users who are verified incorrectly can retry the process or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731">request a manual review</a>, and that users who have been erroneously banned can appeal the decision.</p><p>Discord says the information submitted during this age verification experiment won’t be stored by the company or any of its vendors, regardless of what verification method you choose. “For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face,” says Discord. “For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
