              <p>Los Angeles’ Anime Expo 2025 describes itself as North America’s “largest celebration of Japanese pop culture.” The 34th such event finished recently, with the four-day spectacular seeing an extraordinary 410,000 people show up, and it even played host to a Sukeban (the Japanse female pro-wrestling league) World Championship Fight. Also, of course, it featured squillions of attendees showing up in some superbly good cosplay. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em> heroes Minerablu were there to capture the very best fits.</p> <p>Given the anime focus, costumes obviously skewed that way, but gaming still got a look-in. Look, it’s not like it’s possible to stop at least&nbsp;<em>one Elden Ring</em> outfit getting into the gallery. (The really shocking thing is that there’s not a single person sporting an outfit from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> in this latest collection!) That does mean we get some superbly original stuff, including the most stunning Derpy from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. I imagine the next few cosplay galleries we post are going to contain a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more characters from that movie as the sewing catches up.</p> <p>So click on for the finest fits from Anime Expo 2025. And check back soon to see a video of the event, too.</p>

<p>Players searching for the Red Dead Redemption 2 companion app on Google Play Store or Apple App Store will find that Rockstar has delisted the application. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption fans are being greeted with multiple unfortunate updates today. Firstly, the actor for Rains Fall, Graham Greene, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-actor-graham-greene-sadly-passes-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away at the age of 73</a>. We have now learned that the companion application for RDR2 has been removed after being available for seven years. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-s-companion-app-is-no-longer-available-for-new-users">Red Dead Redemption 2’s Companion App is No Longer Available for New Users</h2>



<p>As revealed through Rockstar Games’ support page (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/red-dead-redemption-2-companion-app-taken-down-app-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameRant</a>), the Red Dead Redemption 2 Companion App is no longer being offered on the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/LHn4jGRxywezllJLdXSjq/unable-to-find-the-red-dead-redemption-2-official-companion-app-on-the-apple-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/6BIENOLOLrjTdQ965aD7G7/unable-to-find-the-red-dead-redemption-2-official-companion-app-on-the-google-play-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Play Store</a> since August 19, 2025. Those who had previously downloaded the application will be able to access it through either their Apple or Google account’s purchase history. Moreover, players who purchased the Red Dead Redemption 2: The Complete Official Guide within the app will be able to access it there.</p>



<p>The Red Dead Redemption 2 companion app was released in 2018. It connected directly to the platform you were playing on and provided real-time interactive information on your smart device. Players could pan and zoom on the map, set waypoints, and mark areas of interest. They were also able to access Arthur Morgan’s core info and stats in real-time. Arthur’s in-game journal, stat tracking through Social Club, a complete digital game manual, plus an optional digital version of the Red Dead Redemption 2 Complete Official Guide from Piggyback, and more were available through the app. </p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption 2 actor has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-actor-admits-misleading-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to misleading fans</a> with an ‘exciting news’ comment. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> has suggested that RDR2 could launch on Switch 2 this year.

Game Pass is one of the most successful video game subscription services on the market, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon. The service boasts a library of hundreds of games that players immediately gain access to upon becoming a subscriber. However, Game Pass is continually adding more games all the time, growing the library little by little.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a current Game Pass subscriber or someone interested in subscribing to the service, you'll likely want to know what future games are arriving in the library. As of right now, several games have official release dates for Game Pass, while other games are confirmed for the service but don't have a concrete launch date yet. Below, you can see a list of every upcoming Game Pass title we know of in 2025, 2026, and beyond.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s nothing in this world as cool as a giant robot. The first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina</a> made that explicably clear. So, it’s something of a surprise to find that Titanic Scion, the brand-new entry in the anime-fuelled mech series, initially swaps out the mechs of the first game and replaces them with Exosuits. It’s suddenly more Anthem than Armoured Core, and while that’s initially something of a disappointment, it makes way for a faster, more immediate combat experience that gives you a ton of customisation options as you set forth on a mission for revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0USA3oKgsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Entering Titanic Scion is entering a war that’s been raging for hundreds of years. Founded in revolution and colonisation, the world of Daemon X Machina saw humanity split itself across two planets, Earth Prime and the ‘blue planet’. A further rift was then caused by an anomaly which saw some people born on the blue planet with special abilities, with society branding them an Outer.</p>


<p>Society’s cruel treatment of them led to an uprising, with the Outers eventually taking control and enacting a strict military regime, separating themselves from the rest of humanity in the Garden, a space station set above the Ground. After years of war and conflict, revolution and response, it’s little surprise to find the humans fighting back under the title of Reclaimers. That’s where you come in, though not in quite the way you expect.</p>
<p>There’s a well-featured character creator here, with a bunch of preset options, male and female body types, and the ability to customise your face with a strong selection to choose from. There’s then three accessory layouts which really give you the choice between having a giant poncho or not, but overall I was very happy with how my hero turned out.</p>


<p>You’re an Outer. The opening sees you being rescued by your teammate Nerve, who pulls you out of a machine that was just about to erase your thoughts and turn you into an unthinking killing machine. In doing so, you’re both now the most wanted traitors in the Garden, and there’s a thoroughly chaotic jaunt through the bowels of the Outers’ station as you attempt to escape while learning the controls.</p>
<p>You do so by hopping into an Arsenal – this time out, a personal mech-suit – which allows you to install and equip various offensive options, from blades and assault rifles to lances and energy shields. Downing enemy Arsenals lets you loot their equipment, but only one, forcing you to make some tough decisions about what to take and what to let go. Fortunately, Titanic Scion gives you a rundown of each item’s stats compared to your own, so you can still make a choice on the fly, even with bullets and explosions filling the air around you.</p>
<p>Looting and tweaking your loadout is key to progressing, and there’s so many things to equip and tinker with that I think people will be able to get their Arsenal feeling and performing exactly the way they want it to. You can carry two weapons per arm, with both offensive and defensive options, and then there’s a shoulder-mounted weapon and auxiliary items.</p>
<p>The new two-handed weapons are brutally slow, but the resulting damage they’re capable of made them an early favourite of mine. Whatever you pick, being able to swap between the different weapons in your loadout on the fly means that you’re able to deal with enemies in whatever way you want or need, as long as you haven’t brought four swords with you.</p>

<p>Locking on is hugely important during battle, as is your radar, and if you don’t keep moving and searching out all the enemies, it’s very easy to become overwhelmed. Combat can feel messy at times, but target indicators help you to find your enemies as you and your teammates tear them apart. There’s multiplayer for up to three players, and you can run through the story together, but only if you’re at the same point. Solo players get to enjoy the assistance of the AI characters, and while they do their bit, it’s not a patch on playing with a group of friends.</p>
<p>After being blasted out of the Garden, you fall to the Ground, discovering that the barren wasteland isn’t completely made up of junk, dust and monsters when you’re rescued by Forge and Toby. Though you’re not totally sold on being helped by a human – turns out people from the Garden are kind of dicks – you’ve little real choice but to follow them, and join up with their Gym.</p>
<p>It’s called a Gym thanks to the Coliseum. Controlled arena battles are held here, with Forge owning what feels like the most backstreet premises in the post-apocalyptic landscape. He convinces you to become one of his fighters – make that his only fighter – and after a short tussle you end up joining up with him and allying yourself with the local freedom fighters known as Reclaimers. It’s fair to say they don’t like you, but they like what you’re capable of.</p>

<p>Returning fans might decry the move to exosuits, and in some ways, it feels like it should reduce the scale of the game. However, that’s tempered by the move to an open world, and you still gain the ability to call down Heavy Armour later in the game. Getting around is so reminiscent of Anthem, especially if you’re blasting around in your suit, but given that I’m one of the few people in the world who still has Anthem installed, that’s a clear positive. You’re not limited to just using your suit either, and you can explore the open world with different vehicles or even alien horses, which weirdly make the game feel more like Dynasty Warriors than Daemon X Machina, as you can charge into battle with a lance.</p>
<p>While enemy suits drop equipment, Immortals, the monstrous creatures you come across on the Ground, drop parts and development opportunities, as well as elements that you can Fuse with your character, intentionally creating mutations in your DNA. You’re going to spend a great deal of time in menus min-maxing your setup. That is right up my alley, but I can see it wearing some people out. There’s a touch of Borderlands to how Titanic Scion’s looting and loadouts feel, but it’s nowhere near as over-the-top with its loot and the different options you have.</p>
<p>There’s such a mix of influences and similarities to other games: Anthem, Armored Core, Xenoblade Chronicles X and Borderlands, but Titanic Scion comes away feeling like its own thing. Running around the open world is an absolute blast, and I love the anime-fuelled visual design and the setting that the team have created. That’s buoyed by the awesome guitar-heavy soundtrack, which adds a healthy dose of adrenaline to everything you do.</p>
<p>Performance on Switch 2 is, annoyingly, merely fine. It runs at a locked 30fps most of the time, though occasional drops happen while driving in one of the vehicles. It feels as though there should be a 60fps option here, especially when the demo’s PC and Steam Deck performance suggest that it should be possible. Here’s hoping that they add in some further graphical options or find a little more performance to achieve it.</p>

                <p>Long gone are the days of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a> being billed as a massive disappointment, as not long after its ninth anniversary the game appears to have no problems pulling players back in. Last week the game's latest major update, Voyagers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-custom-ship-building-and-more/1100-6534325/">went live</a>, adding in a laundry list of features as the game's updates tend to do. With that, it also seems to have brought in a large influx of players, as the game has hit its highest number of players since launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Hello Games co-founder and No Man's Sky programmer Sean Murray took to X to acknowledge the fact, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962598264387108899" rel="nofollow ">sharing a screenshot of the game's concurrent player count</a> at the time of posting. Murray's own screenshot showed 97,986 players all in-game at once, but <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a> actually shows it went a bit higher than that yesterday, reaching 98,285 players. That's still less than half of the game's player count peak of 212,613 it achieved at launch, but an impressive figure considering few games see this kind of resurgence so long after release.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZLz1MW0aE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Voyagers update was, as usual, a hefty one, with the standout new feature being the addition of a new class of starship, the Corvette.

              <p><span>Huntr/x may be a fictional K-pop group, but Netflix has managed to capture one part of real-world K-pop stardom in its official </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> merchandise: photocards. These little pieces of cardboard usually depict fans’ favorite K-pop idols in anything from professional headshots to candid photos you might find on their camera roll. While Netflix is only now really hitting the merchandise angle hard after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-derpy-artist-kids-all-ages-animation-2000621394"><span>animated musical’s runaway success</span></a><span>, one thing it planned ahead for was that fans might want photocards of their favorite members. I even got one of the lead singer, Rumi, when I saw the film at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>sing-along showings last month</span></a><span>. Now, the film’s soundtrack CD is out, and each disc comes with one random photocard of one of the members sealed inside. And since fans love to collect things, the random photocard inside the album has got people buying multiple copies, reselling, and trading like they’re prized </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>Because the photocard is randomized, the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack is basically a blind box. Huntr/x has three members, so there’s a 33 percent pull rate for each card. So it’s entirely possible you could buy three copies of the album and get the same photocard each time, like this TikTok user did:</span></p>   <p><span>That’s how the dice fall sometimes. All these collection crazes are essentially gambling, and while the odds of getting all three Huntr/x photo cards are better than those in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>TCG pull, you can still end up spending a pretty penny on multiple copies of the album trying to complete the set. This has made unboxings a new trend within the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>community, much like you see in most TCG fandoms.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p><span>Unfortunately, this also means that we’re starting to see resellers </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226950263213?_skw=kpop+demon+hunters+cd+photocard&amp;itmmeta=01K459CDHAKAXC06RYPMFCKCVQ&amp;hash=item34d74a31ad:g:nEQAAeSw6INos~Fc&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1e00N5FWhjTc9V9pI53JjABq5WC9KmiL4ZgdVBpZUY8teNZwcWWlaL7vBKUzypUdUm1F1n55tsaNWQlkEr6eMb2qB9PLELWiX%2Beb1wk%2FfK4tvlegg3QrdH%2BDTltwkDUUMFH%2BCXYQ%2BnFikC0lzc5LRm5ETHV%2Bd0sLdohWpqEbMOMKJLOGb9Ttw%2B%2BwlpTWgIxzGq2i3jGzKtQimfQu3U6o8rh24%2Bzp3Guisao6hcJMx0Ioyycy%2BsUEdsaimtBaRcOU5tGmaPnlsjQWEHnBLZ3efAF%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_TYsamhZg"><span>upcharging for opened copies that have a confirmed photocard</span></a><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, Gearbox CEO revealed how Borderlands’ iconic comic-book-inspired art style came to be. </p>



<p>With only 10 days left until Borderlands 4’s release, players have started learning new tidbits of information. Most recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-trophies-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete list of trophies and achievements</a> for the game surfaced online. Now, the developers have revealed how they zeroed in on the game’s beloved art style. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-devs-started-working-on-a-new-art-style-right-before-the-alpha-milestone">Borderlands Devs Started Working on a New Art Style Right Before the Alpha Milestone</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford discussed how Borderlands’ art style was developed and the numerous hurdles they had to overcome to achieve it. When development began for the original game in 2005, the devs were working on six different art styles, which varied from safe to over-the-top.</p>



<p>At the start, they felt that “it’s kind of got to be realism or there’s just no market opportunity.” However, it “just wasn’t exactly right for what the look and feel and vibe of what Borderlands was supposed to be – it didn’t match the gameplay.” Adam May, the art director for Borderlands 4 and a character modeler for the original game, revealed that when Fallout 3 was released, the developers realised that they were in the “same visual place” as Bethesda’s title.</p>



<h2 id="h-random-doodles-led-to-the-creation-of-borderlands-beloved-art-style">Random Doodles Led to the Creation of Borderlands’ Beloved Art Style</h2>



<p>At that time, May was sitting next to a concept artist for the original game, Scott Kester, who used to doodle “illustrated graffiti” during their free time. One of the characters created in these doodles eventually evolved into Captain Flynt, marking the birth of the iconic Borderlands art style that players know and love. With the help of Kester and executive producer Brian Martel, May transformed these 2D sketches into 3D game art and then pitched to Pitchford. </p>



<p>It was a sticky time for them as the game was on tight deadlines and was about to reach its alpha milestone. At that time, they pitched the idea of working on a brand new art style for Borderlands, and Pitchford miraculously agreed to give them two weeks to work on it. The CEO immediately regretted the decision, as he felt that the idea these guys were working on would have to be rejected, given the time constraints. </p>



<p>After the two weeks had passed, Pitchford entered the room, afraid of the inevitability, but to his surprise, the art team had worked wonders. As soon as he laid eyes on the new art style, he felt “it’s f—ing right; It’s right”. “It feels right. And it’s like everything we knew about what was wrong was confirmed when we felt it was right.”</p>

<p>As soon as the new style was finalized, Pitchford knew it would take considerable effort to get it approved by 2K. Surprisingly, after the bit of back and forth, they agreed, and then most of the stuff had to be redone from scratch. The game was in development for several years at that point, and changing the art style meant leaving almost all the levels and characters behind. Only Trash Coast and one other level remained, and the rest was rebuilt. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Borderlands franchise has always prided itself on its multiplayer and inclusivity. The games are still wild rides if you play them by yourself, but let’s see if Borderlands 4 maintains its co-op, split-screen, and crossplay focus for the newest sequel.</p>



<p>I think Gearbox is very excited about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. Not only did Randy Pitchford bring the game’s release date forward (an unheard-of move), but we raved about it on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive preview</a>, and Randy thinks it can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>!</p>



<p>If you’re excited about Borderlands 4 and want to know if you can play with friends across different platforms, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-borderlands-4">Is There Crossplay in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Borderlands 4 team, assemble. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 has complete crossplay functionality across every platform the game is launching on.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Pretty much every major multi-platform market box is ticked off for this one. It’s great to see the Nintendo Switch 2 getting involved in third-party conversations, and if you are buying Gearbox’s newest title on Switch 2, you can play it with people on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and vice versa!</p>



<p>As Handsome Jack would say: “Butt Stallion says ‘Hello.” It’s not a relevant quote, but I love it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-in-split-screen">Can You Play Borderlands 4 In Split-Screen?</h2>



<p><strong>Gearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 also has split-screen multiplayer, but it’s more limited compared to general crossplay.</strong></p>



<p>All this information is via the Borderlands 4 <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a>. Under a section discussing the shooter’s co-op options, here’s what it says: “Borderlands 4 supports up to 4-player co-op online across all platforms, as well as <strong>2-player splitscreen couch co-op on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong>.</p>



<p>To reiterate, split-screen gameplay is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>You’re out of luck if you want to do this on the Nintendo Switch 2 or PC. The FAQ doesn’t explain why this is; the only thing we need to know is that this is the case. End of story. We can lock that answer up in the vault and move on.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-if-borderlands-4-has-cross-progression">Do We Know If Borderlands 4 Has Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>We unfortunately can’t say for certain if Borderlands 4 has cross-progression.</strong></p>



<p>The FAQ covers a variety of topics in great detail. However, one aspect not covered is cross-progression: The ability to transfer your save file across different platforms. Free-to-play live-service games commonly have cross-progression, but for now, we’ll have to put a question mark next to this one until we get clarification.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Borderlands 4’s crossplay inclusions sell you on the game? Is the franchise the perfect multiplayer title? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Also, tell us which new Vault Hunter you have your eyes on.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let-me-love-you-crusader-kings-3.1286388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a problem: when I started working at Kotaku in February 2016, many of my coworkers were big fans of <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Even though a giant fantasy epic was very much not my kind of game, after listening to Luke and Kirk rave about it, I finally <a href="https://kotaku.com/help-me-finish-the-witcher-3-1791040756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it a shot</a> in January 2017. Things didn’t go so well at first, but eventually the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-finally-won-me-over-1791337357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won me over</a> hard. Even if I <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-got-the-worst-ending-in-the-witcher-3-1793040692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whiffed it in the end</a>, <em>The Witcher 3</em> is now one of my favorite games. The problem here is that ever since then, I keep thinking I’ll like games Luke likes, and then making a total ass of myself when I try to play them.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, Defector wrote <a href="https://defector.com/embrace-crusader-kings-iii-and-it-will-take-over-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article about <em>Crusader Kings 3</em></a><em>. </em>This got me thinking about <em>CK3</em>, a game I really tried to get into way back when because <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke</a> made it sound so fun. I <em>really</em> put my back into it. I watched the entirety of a lengthy explainer YouTube playlist Luke sent me. I played the tutorial multiple times. I read a bunch of game guides, and then I played the tutorial a couple more times, and then I watched some more videos, and then I accepted that I would just never figure out the sprawling history roleplaying strategy <em>menus</em> of it all, and I moved on to other things.</p><p>I made a wiseass <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lxncbrjh3c2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky post</a> about Defector’s article, which led to one person sending me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBm8xzpTp8Sp16E5C9y58nD7DF_B9em_L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends at the Table playthrough</a> that I started watching. Like Luke talking about the game, they made it seem so fun and rife with storytelling possibilities that I redownloaded <em>CK3</em> over the weekend. Maybe I’m ready for the game five years later, I reasoned; maybe I’m smarter or more patient, or my life now as a business guy has given me an aptitude for jargon I previously lacked. Maybe <em>this</em> time could be the time I finally become the kind of person who can play <em>Crusader Kings</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After ignoring the warnings of old saves titled things like “wwwhhhhyyyy” and “oh no” and, intriguingly, “do something about ulster,” I deleted them all and started a new game. I played the short version of the Ireland tutorial, reading slowly and nodding along. Then the tutorial pushed me toward a little war with a neighboring area, which it seemed like I was a shoe-in to win. Instead, I lost massively, watching my tiny guys get slaughtered by some other tiny guys while I stared helplessly at my computer screen trying to understand what had gone wrong.</p><p>Oh well! I deleted that save and started <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lxrpo3a35k2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>again</em></a>, trying the longer tutorial this time. I read even slower, sometimes aloud, and I hovered over all the tooltips and opened up all the menus and read all their tooltips too. I finally won a little war, taking over the entirety of Munster. Progress! I was playing <em>CK3 </em>like a big boy!</p><p>I’m not totally sure what happened next: for some reason I ended up with a hostage from Dublin, even though my war was against Desmond. The game told me I could declare war against Dublin, so I did that–<em>completely</em> forgetting about the whole hostage thing and pissing off <em>everybody</em>. I lost the shit out of that war, and now I have negative prestige (I am, fittingly, “disgraced”), everyone in and out of my court is furious with me, and I have basically <em>no </em>idea where to go from here. I tried going on a hunt, the only way to get more prestige that I could afford, but the hunt <em>also</em> went to shit, so now I am still “disgraced” but I also have less money.</p><p>I just want what everybody else has with this game: funny stories and interpersonal intrigue and wacky twists on history. But to get to all that I feel like I have to hack a path through a jungle of nitty-gritty bits and <em>so many people </em>and a zillion menus full of information that I feel like I’m constantly too new to the game to understand. Everything in the game connects to everything else, in a way that I understand a tutorial could not possibly encompass, but for me this means that I feel like the tutorial ends way too early. The introduction to the game feels like it’s either telling me how to use WASD to move the camera, or I’m outmatched by a list of chores to tackle and no one to ask for help, which feels way too similar to my everyday life as it is.</p><p>The way through this is probably to just <em>keep playing</em> the game, letting myself actually fail instead of quitting when I feel like I’m in over my head, but <em>CK3</em> feels like one of those games where I barely even understand what I’m clicking enough to keep moving forward. I get myself into situations I can’t understand through my choices and then don’t understand how to rectify things, or I set a little goal for myself and then have no idea how to go about pursuing it. I feel like I understand what’s going on in the YouTube videos I watch or the articles I read, but somehow that never translates into actually being able to play the game on my own.&nbsp;</p><p>What are you supposed to <em>do</em> in this fucking game, and how the hell do you <em>do</em> it? What is the path from where I am, lost and horrified, to the hundreds of hours of <em>CK3 </em>fun that Luke and Defector and so many of my pals rave about? Can those of you who are good at this game even <em>remember</em> a time when you weren’t, when you looked at <em>CK3</em> with the wide-eyed bafflement of a total newcomer like me? I’m playing Friends at the Table’s videos in another tab as I write this, and they’re laughing and plotting and sound like they’re having the time of their lives. How did they <em>get</em> that? How do <em>I </em>get it?</p><p>A friend has offered to watch me play the game, which I am 100% going to take them up on; maybe the only way to become a <em>CK3</em> guy is to have another <em>CK3</em> guy convert you, the way I understand you can do with religions in the game itself and which I badly want to do but cannot figure out how. But if you have any other tips, at this point it isn’t even about trying to impress Luke anymore, I just want to not feel like a total failure.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deftones-back-2-school-white-pony"><h3>Deftones Are Forever</h3></a><p>'Cause back in school we are the leaders of it all'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

			<p>Asobo Studios recently patched Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with Sim Update 3 to include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The technology allows owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards to achieve even higher frame rates, accelerating performance by 4.2x on average compared to DLSS off.</p>

<iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsrWR1ukPTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In two days, the third-person action/adventure game Hell is Us will also launch with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Of course, those equipped with older RTX GPUs can still activate DLSS Frame Generation and/or DLSS Super Resolution. Moreover, Hell is Us is among those games that have been initially selected to be upgraded for the NVIDIA RTX Blackwell update on GeForce NOW, which means GeForce NOW Ultimate subscribers will be able to activate NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation even on the cloud. By the way, Hell is Us received a great score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review on Wccftech</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences. With a rich atmosphere, stunning visuals, deep lore, wonderfully realized characters and a fairly solid combat experience, it's not a game to be missed.</em></p>



<p>On the same day, Thursday, September 4, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting its The Order of Giants DLC (on which you may read <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an exclusive interview with the developers from Gamescom 2025</a>). The free update that goes live alongside the DLC will add the long-awaited NVIDIA RTX Hair feature to the game, improving the quality of hair and other hair-related rendering elements for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-says-ps5-barrier-to-blame-for-slowing-monster-hunter-wilds-sales.1286361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has blamed something he calls the "PS5 barrier" for slowing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales, suggesting that the console and its ancillary purchases are at least partly responsible for the game's underperformance in recent months.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nikkei</a> (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DriftingSpirit</a>; we're using machine translation for the interview), Tsujimoto says that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' "main platform" is the PS5, but that the "barrier" for this platform is "unexpectedly large".</p>

<p>He says that the console costs around 80,000 yen in Japan (which works out at around $540), but that when adding "software and monthly subscriptions", that cost can reach about 100,000 yen (roughly $670). This, Tsujimoto says, is "not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=VUUTLu7G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=wDvpE_4i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' slowing sales are at least partly down to the "PS5 barrier", according to Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Tsujimoto, this situation isn't unique to Japan, but is "similar overseas as well". Relatedly, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us" rel="nofollow">increased prices for the PS5</a> in the US back in August, with all three major models of the console affected by the price hike.</p>

<p>Tsujimoto says that "sales will begin in the future", presumably pointing to discounts for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>on the horizon. He also says the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">successful launch</a> at around 50,000 yen proves the "high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers".</p>

<p>It's telling that Tsujimoto doesn't make reference to any of the other factors that might be causing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales to slow down.</p>

<p>Players have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">complained</a>, for instance, about the game's lackluster PC performance and lack of endgame content, prompting Capcom to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">move its plans for the latter forward</a> to an earlier patch in August and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">promise more PC optimizations this winter</a>.</p>




<p>It's entirely possible that word-of-mouth regarding these problems has put some players off buying the game, so perhaps when Capcom addresses these issues, sales might pick up. Of course, discounts in major storefront sales won't hurt, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158429/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> arrives at an interesting time in these early months after the release of Switch 2. There haven't been many AAA-styled heavy-hitters to push this system so far, certainly not in terms of action games, at least. And so, Titanic Scion feels like it should give us a reasonable idea of how the console is positioned to handle this type of experience.</p>
<p>And it's a rough first pass. The console's just out, and this is a big old game with a whole lot going on, so it follows, rather unsurprisingly, that some issues are present, and concessions have had to be made to get it running on Nintendo's machine. It turns out the Switch 2 really isn't a pocket PS5 after all! But we knew that, you and I. It just stings a little when your new console can't play the new thing as nice as some other, not-quite-as-new consoles.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158423/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Does it hurt the experience that it doesn't match the 60fps found on other machines? Yes, it does a bit. I've been switching between this and the PS5 demo the past few days and it's absolutely better playing at 60fps, because of course it is. However, the main takeaway I have from playing that demo is actually that, besides the drop in frames, there's a surprising amount of parity across the board with regard to tech issues and jankiness.</p>
<p>This has been useful, because Titanic Scion, as flashy as it is in its combat and its robot models, and as sweet as its vistas can look as you jet-blast across enemy-strewn deserts and through crumbling city-scapes, doesn't half have a bunch of low-res textures crammed in there. It's a bit janky to look at, on all systems. So it's not your Switch 2's fault on that front.</p>
<p>But let's rewind a little - let's cool the old thruster jets, as they say, and talk about what this game, with its ludicrous moniker, is actually all about. What does it want? For the uninitiated, let me break it down thusly: Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a semi-open world game that sees you blast around large locations in a customisable mech suit. It's like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/armored_core_vi_fires_of_rubicon">Armored Core</a>, especially the most recent one, in how it gives you basic story plot points and loads of side missions of the "go fight" or "go get that thing" variety, then boots you out the door to get busy kicking the life out of stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158426/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything here is, essentially, about the mechs. It's about finding weapons, upgrading, unlocking new skills — which is interesting in this one, so I'll get back to that — and making your big robot-self more powerful. You can play it in co-op online (which I couldn't for this review), and compared to the first game, everything here is bigger, more open, and more interesting. Heck, even the story, which is still fairly threadbare, is better. Which isn't saying much, mind, but progress is progress, comrades.</p>
<p>So, here you are, big robot person, brave and strong. And right at the start of the game you find yourself fighting back on behalf of humanity, a brave merc putting it all on the line against the Sovereign Axiom Empire (the traditional bad guys of the piece), whilst also having matters complicated somewhat by the arrival of...well...aliens who want to kill you.</p>
<p>Now, there <em>is</em> more to the story, but not much, so it's best you experience the rest of that for yourself without my spoiling. I should also point out that, whilst the narrative is no great shakes (and the English voice dub is a disaster, so get the Japanese on immediately), there are some very slick and stylish cutscenes holding it together, not to mention all of the fantastically cool mechs and sexy futuristic character designs there are to salivate over. It also does a good line in OTT pantomime villains who talk waaaay too much before I get to beat the crap out of them with a laser sword and a giant hammer. Which is something I always appreciate.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158425/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no real need to dwell on the narrative aspects here because, really, it's all about the robots. And in this regard, Daemon X Machina is a decent enough time. It can't match the likes of FromSoftware's Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (now there's a game I want to see on this console), because, quite frankly, not many action games can, but it finds a place for itself, regardless.</p>
<p>Where Titanic Scion excels is in presenting <em>solid</em> mech scraps that are quick and easy to get into, and this time around it presents them in open-world areas that are improved over its predecessor. This makes for a tighter core gameplay loop overall, as the exploration involved, whilst still fairly simple (you can scan areas to highlight most items), does provide enough hidden secrets, bases to run amok in and, most importantly, sweet loot to find, that the game doesn't feel like it's exclusively about making the attack stats go up. Oh, and you also get to ride around in cars, on horses, and on a motorbike that transforms into a gun. Every little helps.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158420/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I mentioned unlocking new skills earlier, and one of the big shifts in this sequel is that they've attempted, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-a-smart-evolution-for-mech-fans-and-a-good-early-test-for-switch-2">as I spoke about in my preview</a>, to make things a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter</a> this time out. You can chip DNA strands off bad guys, you see, and the bigger and stronger the baddie, the better the DNA will be. Once you've got some of these genetic markers, you can then get busy fusing different strands in order to unlock abilities - at the cost of some fairly hideous mutations to the look of your custom-built avatar. Hey, that's the price of being able to do a turbo kick into a mech enemy's head, mate.</p>
<p>This makes for a situation where you actively <em>want</em> to get into big fights, where usually you might avoid them (especially when you are me), and overall it's a smart addition that melds well with the undeniable depth that's already there in terms of customisation and weapon setups.</p>
<p>With left and right main weapon slots, two side slots, a shoulder and auxiliary slot for weapons, and varying sizes and styles of mech to get to grips with, there's plenty of scope for differing playstyles here at a basic level, and while the first few missions disappoint with lacklustre weapons, give it a few hours and you'll be rocking huge guns called stuff like 'Revenant' that can one-shot those annoying floating testicle things that had been the bane of my existence for a little while.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158424/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With plenty of scope to mix and match, the devs then bring suitably cool weapons to the party, and you can come at the battles presented in a surprising number of ways as a result. I've had a spell rocking a shield and laser sword, mostly because it looks cool to do that when you're a robot, but I also really enjoy dual-wielding machine guns to bother enemies as I circle them, wait for them to get a little tired and then blammo with my long-ranged sniper rifle.</p>
<p>The weapon slots on offer make it a breeze to switch between setups of this nature on-the-fly in battle, and even the CQC — with its hammers and shanks and even grabbing and throwing enemies — holds up, whether you're getting in for punches and timing your dodges to keep the pressure on, or hanging back and hiding and doing all the things that I like to do.</p>
<p>With a decent spread of enemy types and solid combat, this is better than its predecessor already, so if you enjoyed that one, you know you're in for a good time here. However, there are issues. Plenty of them, in fact.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158430/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of performance, even when making peace with the fact that you're looking at 30fps here, I can't help but feel as though I'm experiencing input lag of sorts. It feels mushy and messy at times. On the PS5 version, there's the same feeling; it doesn't feel quite as tight as it should, especially in its dodging, and I think the drop in frame rate on Switch 2 exacerbates this to the point that sometimes I could lose a scrap for reasons other than my own skill failings. Which is not okay.</p>
<p>It makes for a messy feel to the combat — the core of the entire thing — and whilst it's still very playable, and I've completed the roughly 80 hours of tasks it took me to see the end with little real problem, it's disappointing that it's not much slicker. There's also some slowdown as you pass into new areas. Again, this is also noticeable on the PS5, so it's not specifically a Switch 2 thing. Indeed, beyond the frame rate, there's nothing here that I'd worry was the fault of the Switch 2, overly. It's just a game with a lot of rough edges that needs a few patches.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And so, overall, whilst a bit clunky and messy in places, Daemon X Machina is still a reasonably decent time for folk who enjoy customising mechs with a side-helping of perfectly serviceable exploration for good measure, and especially in handheld, where the low-res textures aren't quite so blown up as they are on a big TV. However, the issues with stuttering, mushy controls, and general weakness of the story are hard to ignore, and go quite some way in knocking the experience down.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a decent mech game with plenty of depth in its weapons setups and lots of cool loot to discover in its large open-world maps. The combat is flexible, it's fast, and it's very often plenty of fun.</p>
<p>However, performance issues — which are also present on other platforms, so don't sweat it too much, Switch 2 owners — make for a janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback. It's just not nearly as polished as it could be in this respect. With stutters loading into new areas and low-res textures a common sight (again, also on other systems), the overall feeling here is of a game that needs a few patches and tweaks to get it where it needs to be.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-announcement-patch-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-september-4-announcement-is-not-related-to-new-patch-or-dlc.1286322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new announcement related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be made later this week, but it won't be about new content hitting the game, a CD Projekt Red representative confirmed.</p>



<p>Commenting on speculation made about the announcement on X, CD Projekt Red Senior Community Manager Amelia "Lilayah" confirmed the announcement won't be about a new patch or new DLC. The community manager also reiterated that no Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is in the works, unsurprisingly, so expectations should be kept in check regarding the game getting some new major content in the future.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch.</p>— Amelia "Lilayah" (@Lilayaah) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for what the Cyberpunk 2077 announcement coming on September 4 will be about, no one can say at the moment. This announcement was teased yesterday with an in-lore recruitment ad from the New United States of America, of which Night City is part, revealing a recruitment test for <em>"brave netrunners"</em> willing to join the nation's effort to overcome a mounting cybersecurity threat. Given how Project Orion, the second entry in the series, is still very far from release, could this be a colorful way to announce playtests for an upcoming, smaller project related to the series? Thankfully, the announcement is only a few days away, so it won't take much longer to find out what this is about.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-everwild-producer-joins-xbox-as-chief-of-staff.1286319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has been recruited by Xbox to serve as its new chief of staff, following the cancellation of that game earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in early July, Rare's <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> and various staff members at the studio were let go as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider layoff wave</a> at parent company Microsoft. However, it looks as though O'Connor is one of the Rare staffers who's managed to escape unemployment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, O'Connor, who previously served as an artist and animator at Rare before overseeing <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i>as an executive producer, will now occupy the position of Xbox's chief of staff, which means she'll be overseeing the gaming division's various teams and employees.</p>

<p>Her last credit with Rare is a special thanks nod on 2020's side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Battletoads</em>, with which our reviewer Austin was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battletoads-review" rel="nofollow">particularly impressed</a>&nbsp;(the game, that is, not the credit).</p>

<p>O'Connor also isn't the only Rare luminary to jump ship to Xbox in the last twelve months. She follows in the footsteps of former Rare boss Craig Duncan, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring" rel="nofollow">took the place of Xbox's Alan Hartman</a> as the head of Xbox Game Studios back in October last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many Rare staffers weren't as lucky as O'Connor or Duncan, with several employees losing their jobs as part of the aforementioned Microsoft employee cull, including long-time Rare veteran <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gregg Mayles</a> (again, according to VGC).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rare will announce next (if anything; it may end up going the same way as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>studio The Initiative</a>).
