<p>In Fallout 76, one of the peskiest things you’ll need to do is complete daily and weekly challenges. They might be to kill three Snallygasters or drink five Nuka Cola Cranberry beverages. It might be as trivial as picking up a handful of scrap items or something as challenging as laying waste to a horde of Deathclaws.</p>



<p>In this ultimate guide to Fallout 76 challenge locations, I’ll help you find everything you need to complete these challenges. As the challenges expand over time, so too will this guide, so be sure to bookmark it to keep coming back for more.</p>



<p>In no particular order, let’s start cracking through where to find these deliverables for Fallout 76 daily challenges.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-snallygasters-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Snallygasters in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>If you’re tasked with killing Snallygasters in Fallout 76 for a daily challenge, you’ll want to head to the nastier areas of the map, typically where you’ll find swamps, toxic pools, and other environmental hazards.</p>



<p>The best place to find a Snallygaster in Fallout 76 (or three) is the Flooded Trainyard.</p>



<p>If you head to the Flooded Trainyard in Fallout 76, you’ll be greeted by as many as half a dozen Snallygasters, ripe for the taking.</p>



<p>But where is the Flooded Trainyard?</p>



<p>Well, you’ll need to head out to the Cranberry Bog to find it:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best Snallygaster location in Fallout 76 is near Hemlock Holes in the Toxic Valley at the top of the map.  If you head south from Hemlock Holes, you’ll find Snallygasters and even a Grafton Monster.</p>



<p>Hemlock Holes can be found here:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-gulpers-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Gulpers in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It can be quite tough to track down a decent Gulper location in Fallout 76, but it’s not impossible. If you want to find Gulpers for a Fallout 76 daily challenge, you’ll need to head into The Mire and track through the dark and dingy forest.</p>



<p>The best place to find Gulpers in Fallout 76 is at the Gulper Lagoon – the clue is in the name, you see.</p>



<p>Here’s the top spot for Gulpers for daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Alternatively, you could wait around for Moonshine Jamboree to pop. That event is positively bursting with Gulpers, so you’ll complete this daily challenge to kill Gulpers in no time at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-teapots-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Teapots in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It might seem bizarre, but Fallout 76’s daily challenge structure can include a request to find teapots for no reason whatsoever. It’s one of the trickier daily challenges as it requires you to find something small in a <strong>very </strong>large map, and ground loot can often seem randomised.</p>



<p>Fear not – it’s not all that difficult to find a teapot in Fallout 76, and if you need multiple, you can try server hopping to see if more teapots pop up.</p>



<p>To secure the best teapot locations in Fallout 76, you’ll want to check out the Palace of the Winding Path. At this location, you’ll find more than a dozen teapots scattered around.</p>



<p>This is where you’ll find teapots in Fallout 76 with ease:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find teapots at the Palace of the Winding Path, you can try elsewhere. The next best location for teapots in Fallout 76 is Helvetia, the small town near Vault 76. Here, you’ll find half a dozen (or more) teapots lurking around:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-mirelurk-eggs-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Forget the Mirelurks themselves, some Fallout 76 daily challenges want you to find <strong>Mirelurk Eggs</strong>. As you can imagine, you’ll almost always find the two together, so it could be a case of killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>It’s easy to find the best Fallout 76 Mirelurk Egg locations, though.</p>



<p>If you head to Quarry X3 in the Cranberry Bog, you’ll find dozens of Mirelurk Eggs. Be warned, though – you’ll have to tussle with Mirelurks and even a Mirelurk Queen if you’re unlucky:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best location for Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76 is around the Ohio River Adventures site. If you explore the riverbanks around this location, you’ll find Mirelurk Eggs everywhere:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-rabbits-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Rabbits in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s tough to find Rabbits in Fallout 76 because they’re so small and they blend in well with the environment, but with a keen eye (and perhaps VATS), you’ll be able to find a few for your daily challenges.</p>



<p>The best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76 is near the Whitespring Bunker. Here, you’ll need to explore the area, but you should manage to find Rabbits easily and tick off some Fallout 76 daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any Rabbits near the Whitespring Bunker, you can try checking the Twin Lakes location in the Savage Divide. This is the next best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-bobblehead-in-fallout-76">Where to Find a Bobblehead in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Every Fallout fan knows about the Vault-Tec Bobbleheads. They’re everywhere throughout the series, and they come with some seriously helpful character upgrades.</p>



<p>In Fallout 76, Bobbleheads tend to spawn in static locations, which means they’ll always be there whenever you jump onto a new server – unless someone has grabbed one first.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76:</p>



<p><strong>On top of the mansion at Clancy Manor:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Camden Park, near the Minor Miner Zone Sign or on top of the Widowmaker rollercoaster</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Morgantown Airport, sitting in a quarantine tent and in the laboratory hanger near the airstrip</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are hundreds of Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76, but these are some of the most reliable. Let me know in the comments where you go to find Bobbleheads in Fallout 76.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-magazines-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Magazines in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Like Bobbleheads, Magazine locations in Fallout 76 are static, and you’ll find consistent spawns everywhere. Unfortunately, Fallout 76 Magazines are also in high demand all the time, so you’ll need to have luck on your side <strong>or </strong>have access to a private server to find one.</p>



<p>There are some top Magazine locations in Fallout 76 that you can try checking before you’ve even walked too far from Vault 76, which is nice.</p>



<p><strong>Check the south cabin and the treehouse in the Alpine River Cabins:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the main reception counter, the kitchens, and the bunk beds in Bolton Greens:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the airplane seats, the kitchen platform, and the cockpit of the plane at Horizon’s Rest:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of these locations yield multiple Magazines in Fallout 76, so you should be able to find at least one or two to resolve these daily challenges.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-wood-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Wood in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s a relatively mundane thing to track down, but many daily challenges in Fallout 76 revolve around finding building materials. In this challenge, you’ll be tasked with finding Wood locations in Fallout 76. It might seem easy, but it’s not – you can’t just go cutting down trees, after all.</p>



<p>The best location to find Wood in Fallout 76 is at the Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. This location can be found in the Savage Divide close to the Sons of Dane Compound, and it’s bursting with Wood for daily challenges in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-soap-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Soap in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Finding Soap in Fallout 76 is important, as keeping clean in the harsh, post-apocalyptic wasteland is something all explorers should be doing. Perhaps not, but that doesn’t stop the Fallout 76 daily challenges circuit from tasking you with finding stacks of Soap in the game.</p>



<p>It’s a little tougher to find Soap as it’s not guaranteed to spawn in many places. However, I’ve tracked down the best locations for Soap in Fallout 76, so you don’t have to.</p>



<p>The easiest location for Soap in Fallout 76 is at the Whitespring Resort. Here, you can access the Whitespring Mall, and from there, you’ll track down the Whitespring Spa. In the Spa, you’ll find up to <strong>seven </strong>Soap at one time:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any at the Whitespring Resort, you can find Soap in Fallout 76 by heading to Darling Sister’s Lab – just don’t ask me what they were doing with this much soap:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here, you’ll find <strong>seven </strong>Soap just sitting in a wheelbarrow.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-montage-lets-slip-that-two-fan-favourite-rifles-could-be-coming-back.1129299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Activision took to social media to promote International Women’s Day with a Call of Duty trailer focused on female characters. The punchy montage showcased some of the most popular female streamers and in-game operators, but it also let slip a few key details about the future of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In a couple of sequences in the montage, we see current operators running around with AMAX and Kilo assault rifles. These instantly recognisable weapons were firm favourites when Verdansk was rolling around in Warzone between 2020 and 2021, and it looks like they’re coming back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hit-the-nostalgia">Hit the Nostalgia</h2>



<p>It was mentioned recently that if Verdansk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">return to Warzone is a flop</a>, Warzone itself could be on the rocks and scheduled for closure. At the very least, Activision will scale back resources and prepare to keep Warzone afloat with a skeleton crew, as the downfall of the battle royale has been unravelling over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>When season three arrives in Call of Duty next month, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">a sizeable delay</a>, it should bring with it the original Verdansk map from 2020. That’s not all, though – according to the recent Call of Duty montage released by Activision, we’re also set to get some OG weapons back, too.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: The Kilo 141 and AMAX are officially returning to Warzone with Season 03! </p><p>Confirmed by todays IWD trailer posted by Call of Duty! <a href="https://t.co/RWxBbxw8zv">pic.twitter.com/RWxBbxw8zv</a></p></div>— Task Force News (@TaskForceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaskForceNews/status/1898397599930986953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I’m holding out hope that the Grau makes a return, but I’ll settle for the AMAX and Kilo. There are so many ‘meta’ weapons that Activision’s teams could bring back to Warzone, but I <strong>really hope </strong>the DMR and Mac-10 combination is kept well away from this iteration of the battle royale game.</p>



<p>It’s not confirmed, but featuring the weapons front and center in a trailer this close to the launch of season three is pretty telling. If the original timeline were being adhered to, we’d be just ten days away from the launch of the game’s third season. Instead, we’ll need to wait until April 3rd.</p>



<p>What weapons do you want to see returning to Warzone this year? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-too-easy-making-tougher/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-%E2%80%98too-easy%E2%80%99-and-blizzard-is-preparing-to-make-it-tougher.1129290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-too-easy-making-tougher/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>During a recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s developers working on Diablo 4 reflected on the most recent season, suggesting that things didn’t pan out as expected. They confirmed that the game has become far too easy and revealed that players are levelling up in ‘half the time’ compared to previous seasons, even on harder difficulty levels.</p>



<p>As someone new to Diablo, I can attest to that. I’m usually awful at challenging games, but even after cranking it up a few levels, I’m having no issues whatsoever with Diablo 4.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-hell">Prepare for Hell</h2>



<p>When the next season rolls around in Diablo 4, players will find themselves levelling up slower and facing a tougher grind compared to the current season, which is focused on the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>



<p>In the recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s Colin Finer revealed that players are ‘chewing through some of the content’ much too quickly, hitting level 60 and securing their Paragon classification far too rapidly and with too few struggles.</p>



<p>In season 8, players will find that they’re levelling slower through the first 25 levels of a new character and that rarer loot – such as Legendary items – will be much harder to find.</p>



<p>Here’s the full campfire chat with Blizzard:</p>

<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/536470/diablo-4-blizzard-too-easy-season-8-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The team revealed that ‘too many’ players have found their way into the highest difficulty level of the game in record time, which represents a kind of imbalance in the player base.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is — in this case Torment 4 — to be aspirational, and to us that means around 10% (of players).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, around 50% of the players in the Vessel of Hatred season have made it to the highest difficulty level. To battle back against that issue, Blizzard will be adding new, more challenging boss characters in the new season, and existing bosses will have their abilities cranked to the max.</p>



<p>It’ll be a while before all that arrives, though. The next season of Diablo 4 isn’t expected to drop until April 29.</p>

<p>In the latest trailer for the second season of The Last of Us, we’re given a brief glimpse at the expansion of the story established in the 2020 game. It has been known for a while that the sheer amount of meat on the bones has given way to the second game having a two-series split in terms of the live-action adaptation, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunners from creating fresh storylines.</p>



<p>In particular, we’re given an extended look at the attack on Jackson—Ellie and Joel’s home haven in the game—by vast swathes of infected. This sequence isn’t replicated in the game, but some of the perspectives are reminiscent of No Return, the additional mode added with the release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-galore">Content Galore</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part II has plenty of inspiration to draw from when it comes to creating extra content for the live-action adaptation. In 2023, with the launch of the first season, viewers were treated to an entire episode that explored the backstory of Bill and Frank – and that sequence alone won the show an Emmy Award.</p>



<p>In the latest trailer, we get the idea that Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, and everyone else involved is following a similar pattern in the second (and assumedly the third) season of the HBO show.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once again, the cinematics smack of the most faithful recreation possible, and we can now see that a fair amount of flashback content will be included in season two. For instance, we’ll be heading back to the prequel scenes that see Ellie and Joel explore a museum on Ellie’s birthday, ultimately discovering a building packed with dinosaurs, spacecraft, and <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<p>We also get an extended look at the Seraphites, but it doesn’t look like Lev and Yara are being revealed just yet. We do see some other sequences that suggest the Seraphites and their background will be explored further in the show, which would help to set up a little more lore for those uninitiated in the story thus far.</p>



<p>The WLF is front and centre, too – as is Abby’s band of antiheroes heading to Jackson for no particular reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two drops on April 13 in full – are you going to binge watch this one? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Retroid, the China-based company that makes the Pocket Mini, announced on Discord that it will accept returns of the device but only during a limited March 8th to March 14th window — and capped at just 200 returns from owners who live outside of China, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/its-official-retroid-pocket-mini-shader-issue-cannot-be-fixed/"><em>RetroHandhelds</em> reports</a>.</p><p>Earlier in the week, the outlet says Retroid acknowledged it couldn’t fix the issue, which affects how the screen shows scanline and pixel grid shaders used to give classic emulated games the appearance of being played on the CRT displays they were designed for. The effects can show up as “misplaced scanlines, uneven pixels, or a slightly distorted image,” <em>RetroHandhelds</em> writes.</p><p>In this morning’s message, Retroid says carrying out this return campaign is a “large and costly endeavor,” and that it expects “a lot of return requests outside of screen-related issues.” Retroid also mentions it is asking customers to pay to ship their returns, which it promises to reimburse. Finally, the company added that it will offer all Pocket Mini owners “a $10 stackable coupon” for two of its future handhelds.</p><p>As Russ from the Retro Game Corps YouTube channel notes in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1j6ohs3/how_would_you_address_the_rp_mini_screen_issue/">post on Reddit</a> asking for recommendations to pass along to the company for dealing with the situation, Retroid is in a hard situation as a small company that now faces having to pay for very expensive shipping on returns. But that doesn’t change the fact that many gamers who bought the $199 handheld specifically to play retro games are left with a device whose otherwise impressive display does a bad job with some of the oldest tricks in the emulation book.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The last of those is significant because the extent of Ellie’s knowledge about those events is kept  a bit of a mystery throughout <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and this version of the scene seems to take place in the Jackson settlement they both live in, rather than at the scene of the crime as it did in the game.

No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team needed some real-world data to help in their research so they went to the Arizona desert to ride in an off-road vehicle and take off over rocky terrain. This new ride doesn't take place in Radiator Springs, but instead it will be a thrilling rally race through the mountains, so they want it to feel just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From there, they worked with a motocross company to build a dirt track of their own to race around and used that to develop what will eventually be the ride vehicle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re using a customized production vehicle,” Hundgen continued. “It has sensors all over it, and we’re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These vehicles will also get some Disney and Pixar magic thrown in as each car will have its own personality, name, and number.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/08/cars-1741464991876.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Robert Downey Jr. Stops by Disney's SXSW Panel to Help Share More About the New Avengers Campus Attractions</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/08/rdj-20241219-071-v3-2048x1365-1741465033594.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland's Avengers Campus is getting two new attractions, including one called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disneylands-avengers-attraction-is-officially-called-avengers-infinity-defense-d23-2024">Avengers Infinity Defense</a> where guests will team up with members of the Avengers to take on King Thanos across multiple worlds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-microsoft-account/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new FAQ from Playground Games has revealed that to play Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation 5, players will need a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>The news, which has started to be picked up online (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra</a>), shows in the <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that the upcoming port will require a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>It reads, “Q: Do I need a Microsoft account to play Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation 5?”</p>



<p>“Answer: A: Yes, in addition to a PSN account you’ll need to link to a Microsoft account in order to play Forza Horizon 5 on PS5. This process begins the first time you start up the game on your console.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that an Xbox game coming to the PlayStation 5 has required an account, though, so this isn’t new. A Microsoft account is needed for the likes of Sea of Thieves and similarly, even for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft.</p>



<p>So fear not, this isn’t a new requirement just for Forza Horizon. However, we have contacted Xbox in the hopes to receive comment to clear the air just in case this was a mistake. Should clarification be given, we’ll update the article.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is set to release for the PlayStation 5 on April 25, 2025.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5? Let us know down below, and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-turned-hans-capon-into-a-superstar-streamer-in-one-month.1129101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the game’s most prolific actors, Luke ‘LordHansCapon’ Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-fit-for-a-lord">Content Fit for a Lord</h2>



<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and he’s front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second title’s most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, he’s a lovable rogue who you’ll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. I’m in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world 🫶 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> I’m coming for you bro 👊 </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, he’d streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. That’s one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Dale’s latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Marvel Rivals launched last December - here's its launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0veB7q9P4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst many players seem to get grief merely for playing certain characters (primarily Jeff the Landshark), others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk7gf9/">say</a> they regularly hear racist and sexist slurs, but "haven't gotten a ban notification for weeks" even when they report offending players (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-racism-no-username-moderation-called-out/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"The problem is that this takes a toll on you," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgj7stz/">explained one player</a>, responding to a suggestion that players should "mute, report, block" and move on.</p>
<p>"As a woman, I don't use mic unless with my friends. If I speak with random teammates I'll always get some insult or disgusting comment. I just ignore, report and block, but it's not nice at all. It's not like 'haha what a loser'. First time maybe. The third game you hear something like that you just want to stop playing even if you love the game.</p>
<p>"So in cases of racism, it's the same," they added. "Yeah, ignore those losers, but reading or hearing insults over and over again makes you really want to not play anymore."</p>
<p>"I'm sick of people telling women what they need to do to counter the harassment they're experiencing like that's their job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk4gxa/">added</a> another respondent. "That's just the digital version of telling women not to dress some specific way or they're 'asking for it'."</p>
<p>Black players also contributed to the thread, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjh1br/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjornc/">admitting</a> "comms stay off with randoms" completely, even in ranked play.</p>
<p>Other players have taken to X/Twitter, with this commenter writing: "Seriously?? MarvelRivals, wheres the moderation??" asked one player, including a <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878646544142086654">screenshot</a> of a grossly antisemetic username. "Big fan of the game but seeing this mid game is gross."</p>
<p>"Its even worse [because] I can't leave the match without being penalised and having my own gameplay experience suffer, so I just have to play with this person," they <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878647306997952674">added</a>.</p>
<p>"When you think about it, it's even weirder when it's in a Marvel game," said u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgkeiwq/">fistfightcrash</a>.</p>
<p>"Stan Lee was pretty clear that what the X-men was originally about was the civil rights movement. This is a Stan Lee quote from the 60s:</p>
<p>'Let's lay it right on the line. Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today. It's totally irrational, patently insane to condemn an entire race.'</p>
<p>"If you're racist, how could you possibly think this is your space?" they concluded. "Unless you're real old, Marvel was probably vocally anti-racist before you were born."</p>
<p>We've reached out to NetEase for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We also reminisced, eight years after the fact, about what made the launch of the Nintendo Switch so unforgettable, and gushed about why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ Rove is easily our favorite new game character so far this year. All these perspectives and more are served up for your lazy weekend reading pleasure.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8d753b7cabcfe8b865bca5cfd441264e" data-recommend-id="image://8d753b7cabcfe8b865bca5cfd441264e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Discord icon appears over a black background.

It’s the default place for companies to build communities around their games and for the people who play them to hang out with one another, coordinate gaming sessions, or just shoot the shit about whatever’s going on in life. It’s one of the least crappy social media platforms out there right now, but it might not stay that way for long.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="335d899c377996583d8eb756ffcd381b" data-recommend-id="image://335d899c377996583d8eb756ffcd381b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 walks through an underwater area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 walks through an underwater area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="335d899c377996583d8eb756ffcd381b" data-recommend-id="image://335d899c377996583d8eb756ffcd381b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 walks through an underwater area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has all the makings of a modern turn-based classic. After playing a few hours of Sandfall Interactive’s dark fantasy RPG, I can say that <em>Expedition 33 </em>grasps the melodrama of modern <em>Final Fantasy</em> and marries it with the tactical turn-based combat fans of that series have been craving a return to for decades. On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I’ve gotten has me eager to try the full meal. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-recommend-id="image://61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-format="png" data-width="1219" data-height="685" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Suikoden 1 and 2 protagonists stand at attention.

<p>That's not all, either - Update 3 also brings the "highly-requested" return of the Western theme.</p>
<p>As for Update 4? Frontier's still being coy, but so far it's revealed players will able to build their own restaurants in which you'll have to "satisfy multiple guest needs and tolerances", Frontier Workshop extra features such as a Featured Creators list, alerts, and a What's Hot list, plus career maps in Sandbox mode in Act 2.</p> <div>

<p>We can also expect stock coasters (part 3), an as-yet-unannounced additional ride, plus "franchise mode improvements" and "ongoing stability and performance enhancements". Expect more details as we get closer to April.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC, whilst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-outlined-bringing-more-rides-and-continued-performance-improvements">February introduced new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars</a>.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," Matt wrote in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, awarding it 2 out of 5 stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A highly regarded roleplaying game from the original PlayStation era, it’s renowned for its sprawling storyline and huge cast of playable characters. That also makes it pretty intimidating, and I’ve had a copy sitting on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">my PS Vita</a> just waiting for when I might have the free time to finally dig in. After all that waiting, I’m now playing a new remastered collection that includes the first two games in the series instead. And it made me realize that, for the past several months, my personal gaming time has been dominated by classic, turn-based RPGs — an experience that has really made clear the genre’s realm of possibilities.</p><p>It started with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">excellent new version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a>, which launched last November. That game was the equivalent of video game comfort food: an exceedingly straightforward fantasy adventure that has been spruced up with gorgeous visuals, a lush orchestral soundtrack, and some very welcome quality of life tweaks. Soon after that, Mistwalker released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">an updated version of <em>Fantasian</em></a>. It’s technically not an old game — it originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">debuted on Apple Arcade</a> in 2021 — but it has the soul of one, with <em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi using it as a way to explore new ideas in presentation and combat. Then, to top it all off, the “pixel remaster” version of the very first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade"><em>Final Fantasy</em> hit Apple Arcade</a> in January.</p><p>These were all games I had played before, but digging through them again in quick succession made me appreciate their strengths. <em>DQ3</em> and <em>FF</em> embody a true sense of adventure. Both have straightforward stories that are easy to follow (or ignore, if you don’t care about that sort of thing) but locations and systems that make venturing into towns, dungeons, and the wider world exciting. <em>DQ3</em> made that type of experience incredibly approachable, with its beautiful new presentation and streamlined gameplay, while I’ve discovered that <em>FF</em> is quite possibly the ideal mobile game: something deep enough to keep me engaged but also an experience where it still feels like you’re making progress when you only have a short window to play.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em>, meanwhile, is like a modern reinterpretation of what a classic turn-based RPG could be. In a lot of ways, it’s classic <em>FF</em>, from the amnesiac protagonist to the the world that’s a mix between fantasy and sci-fi. But it also has some clever twists on the formula, like battles that let you aim attacks and a tool for delaying random battles for when you just want to explore. This is all on top of the headline-grabbing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">visuals made of real-world dioramas</a>. And while I’m only a few hours into playing <em>Suikoden</em> for the first time, I’ve already been struck by the ambition of its storytelling, which manages to cram a lot of political intrigue into the confines of a traditional RPG structure.</p><p>That’s all to say that even at a time when there’s plenty of impressive, big, and modern RPGs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review"><em>Dragon Age</em></a>, there’s still something distinct and interesting about the classic turn-based formula, and it’s exciting to see all the ways that various studios have utilized it over the years. That’s true whether you’re replaying a new version of something old or, like me, trying out <em>Suikoden</em> for the very first time. Even better: there’s still more to come. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension">Sakaguchi told me</a> earlier this year, when it comes to his studio’s next game, their “goal is to create something old but new at the same time.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Buckle up, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s Bleasdale House has had a terrifyingly good makeover.</p>
<p>The farmhouse - one of the first maps to launch with the hit horror in 2020 - gets a whole new look with 10th March's update. With 21 rooms spread across two floors and an attic space, developer Kinetic games said, "Bleasdale is an ideal location for budding ghost hunters to settle in for a potentially horrifying evening".</p>

<p>Following "major alterations", the house now boasts an all-new layout, brand new areas - including a new tea room and trophy room - and a new visual design, although the fan-favourite touches, such as the fireplace, piano, and loop-friendly dining table remain.</p>
<p>"The new dining room will be larger than before, and plays host to a large dining table in the centre, with lots of fragile new items for ghosts to play with," Kinetic teased. "The living room will feature a large fireplace, a grand piano, and some plush red leather sofas, perfect to hide the bloodstains for a cozy night in.</p>
<p>"Players will also be able to explore the new tea room and trophy room, each filled with a variety of intriguing collectors items - that is, if you find pet plate collections and ominous relics intriguing."</p>
<p>Perhaps most intriguingly of all, however, is Bleasdale's all-new garden, which now counts as a ghost room… which is bad news for babies like me, who play the entire game cowering in that doorway.</p>

            <p>Parents have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games for allegedly creating "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO" with its store items.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">Polygon</a>, two parents have filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">a claim with a San Francisco court</a> on behalf of their children, citing "deceptive practices employed on a massive scale in one of the world’s most popular video games [Fortnite]".</p>

<p>"Some items, such as the ultra-rare Renegade Raider outfit, were offered briefly and have not been offered in more than six years," lawyers wrote. "Others disappear only to reappear weeks later. These offerings and their schedules are subjects of intense interest to Fortnite players."</p>
<p>Taking issue with how the Fortnite Store rotates items on its digital storefront, the complaint reads:</p>
<p>"But, when their countdown timers expired, Fortnite’s Item Shop products did not disappear or return to full price. They remained available for purchase, often at the same purportedly discounted rate, for many days or even weeks at a time. This was an unlawful scheme.</p>
<p>"Fake sales with made-up expiration times are deceptive and illegal under state statutes proscribing unfair and deceptive trade practices, which prohibit misleading advertisements concerning the reasons for or existence of price reductions and representing that items have characteristics or qualities they do not have. Numerous courts have found that fake countdown timers like Epic’s run afoul of these and similar prohibitions."</p>
<p>This is likely referring to a similar lawsuit in the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games is currently appealing a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator</a>, which similarly accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". At the time of writing, that decision is still pending.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Epic Games said: "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes">Last year we removed the countdown timer in the Item Shop</a> and we offer protections against unwanted purchases. This includes a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/updates-to-fortnite-purchase-cancellation-and-social-settings">hold-to-purchase mechanic</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">instant purchase cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">self service returns for shop purchases</a> and an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.</p>
<p>"When a player creates an Epic account and indicates they are under 13, they are unable to make real money purchases until a parent provides consent. Once they do, we offer industry leading parental controls including PIN protecting purchases. We will fight these claims."</p>
<p>Earlier this week we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-suing-prolific-thief-who-stole-and-sold-player-accounts-on-an-industrial-scale">Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts</a>, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
