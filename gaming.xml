			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440900/Conan_Exiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a> is getting a huge update that introduces fully-voiced companions. The new update, Age of Heroes, is the third season of expansive updates to the game. While they are adding this update, it won't be available for players until October.</p>
<p>The first half of the massive update will arrive in October. This update adds a new type of companion that players can recruit and accompany on their adventures in this sandbox survival game. These companions will be fully voiced, adding an extra level of immersion to Conan Exiles in the Age of Heroes update.</p>
<p>There are two fully-voiced companions that you can choose from in this update. They are Freya, the Aesir Warrior, and Liu Fei, the Khitan Sorcerer. Both companions come with a story that players can explore and learn more about as they journey. In addition, the companions' abilities are shaped by what happens throughout their journey and the player's decisions.</p>
<p>While the player can choose from only two companions, more are planned for future updates.</p>
<p>In addition to companions being added to Conan Exiles through the Age of Heroes update, a major change is coming to chapter one of the Age of Heroes season. The Living Settlements update transforms thralls into living, animated inhabitants of the player's base.</p>
<p>This means they will go around the base while performing basic tasks, emoting, and tending to their needs, such as food and sleep. However, if their home is threatened, they will also strive to defend it.</p>
<p>In addition to these two major updates in the first chapter of the Conan Exiles Age of Heroes update, there will be plenty of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>While the Age of Heroes season has only two major updates listed, plenty more are planned, with minor updates occurring between major updates. These minor updates will add new events to the game and focus on tweaking it to make it more accessible to the player base.</p>
<p>One of the main changes <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-dev-talks-age-of-war-chapter-3-additions-promises-support-for-as-long-as-there-are-players/">Funcom</a> has made to Conan Exiles is getting rid of the Battle Pass. Instead, the items from the Battle Pass are being redistributed across the game, with the Bazaar Shop still remaining.</p>
<p>There is no definitive date for the Age of Heroes update at the moment; other than that, it will arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass in October 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group, the holding company that currently owns the rights to&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>in the gaming world, has announced that it's currently prototyping several games set in Middle-earth.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-828-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest financial report</a>, which covers the first quarter of 2024 (from April to June), Embracer says that it's "actively testing and prototyping multiple new game concepts" that take place "within the Middle-earth world".</p>
<p>Embracer goes on to say that these projects will explore "a wide range of immersive and authentic gameplay" and that they'll take "an honest and tactical approach to world-building and authentic storytelling".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-middle-earth-embracer.jpg?itok=n_Rs3eNK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-middle-earth-embracer.jpg?itok=jhKQKNnP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If any of these prototypes come to fruition, then more&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way. With games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>&nbsp;on the way, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-steam-xbox-release-date">recently-revealed Steam and Xbox release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>has a pretty stacked plate in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Of course, Embracer doesn't go into detail regarding any of these prototypes, nor does it name the studios developing them. Since the projects are prototypes, it's entirely possible none of them will ever see the light of day, but hey, at least more&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be coming!</p>
<h2>Embracer Group's sales are down overall</h2>
<p>It's been a bit of a punishing quarter for Embracer on the whole. According to the financial report, the company's net sales are down 24%, with PC and console games being the hardest-hit outside of the Entertainment and Services category.</p>
<p>CEO Lars Wingefors puts this down to "a lower release activity" for the quarter, pointing to upcoming releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date"><i>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</i></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>, and more content for&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>as chances for the company to turn its fortunes around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group.jpg?itok=vYtCiSPT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group.jpg?itok=pO1gSLmU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Embracer's upcoming slate includes&nbsp;<em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The report also notes that Embracer currently has 127 projects in active development, as opposed to last year's 141, so it looks like 14 projects have been canceled within the last year or so.</p>
<p>Embracer's total headcount has also dropped from 12,069 last year to 10,844 this year, showing the brutal results of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">company's restructuring program</a> (which is supposed to have concluded, although the project cancellations tell a different story).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-dlc-saves-fromsoftware-parent-company-from-cyberattack-losses/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The parent company of FromSoftware released an <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym6/161906/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a> today revealing that Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved them after incurring “extraordinary losses” from the recent cyberattack.</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/390795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBiz</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftwares-parent-company-reports-major-growth-despite-serious-losses-from-cyberattack-with-elden-ring-dlc-powerfully-driving-its-whole-game-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa’s sales increased by 11.9% year on year, operating profit rose by 84.5% year on year, and ordinary profit saw a 26.2% year-on-year increase. However, the company experienced an unfortunate <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-group-hack-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyberattack</a> in June, resulting in a loss of “approximately 2,000 million yen” (around $13 million). This cyberattack led to a 10.1% decrease in net profit for FromSoftware’s parent company.</p>



<p>The results in the gaming segment “were driven powerfully by the strong domestic sales” of Elden Ring’s DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, which also helped in the repeat sales for the base game. The net sales for the gaming segment were up by 80.2% yearly, with operating profit up by 108.1% year-on-year. It is worth noting that this number only consists of sales till June 30, and Shadow of the Erdtree was released on June 21; the actual number could be way higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you look at the records Shadow of the Erdtree managed to accomplish, it’s no surprise that the Elden Ring DLC saved FromSoftware’s parent company. The DLC sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 million copies within the first 3 days</a>, became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-highest-rated-dlc-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated DLC of all time</a> and more. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-to-ditch-2k-launcher-alongside-civ-6.953904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>won't use its proprietary launcher, and what's more, said launcher has also been removed from <i>Civilization 6&nbsp;</i>on PC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1esesqi/2k_launcher_has_been_removed_from_civ_6_and_will/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Reddit post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>subreddit, community manager Sarah Engel confirmed that the launcher "has been removed from&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>and will not be implemented for&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>".</p>
<p>The launcher won't appear when you boot up&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>on Steam, although if you're playing on the Epic Games Store, you'll still see it for a while. Engel says there are plans in place to remove the launcher on the Epic version of the game "in the near future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6.jpg?itok=YAkRnYyy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6.jpg?itok=Mxr5-SUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 2K Launcher won't bother you when you're launching&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6&nbsp;</em>anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>No reason was given for the launcher's removal, either in Engels' post or in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/289070/view/4362384695881028068" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>Steam page</a> that also announces the change.</p>
<p>However, a quick look through the comments on the Reddit post shows that the launcher wasn't exactly popular with players, with commenters describing it variously as "less than worthless", "useless", and "a chore". Ouch.</p>
<p>Amusingly enough, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>on PC won't use the 2K Launcher is near enough the first bit of news we've had about the game for some time. It's due for a Gamescom reveal next week, though, so we'll learn more about how&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>will actually play then.</p>
<p>What we do know is that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will continue the series' tradition of combining historical events (and an increasingly liberal interpretation thereof as games progress) with deep strategy. Hopefully, it'll also let you amass an arsenal of nukes as Gandhi again.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> for the game is being pretty coy as well, which you'd expect from a game that hasn't had its first gameplay reveal yet.</p>
<p>In any case, stay tuned for more information on&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>&nbsp;and everything else 2K-related. If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6</em>&nbsp;on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">you can do so here</a>, and don't forget to check out our article on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/best-civilization-vi-mods">the best <em>Civilization 6&nbsp;</em>mods</a> to make your experience even more fun.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-rising-remaster-no-longer-gives-you-points-for-erotica-creepshots-because-its-not-required-or-appropriate">the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster</a>. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.</p><!--more-->
<p>The Lacerator is as good at Lacerating as Max is at shagging. If he catches you trying to leave his sordid, trap-filled hideout, he'll try to chop your appendages off. Losing a limb isn't game-over, however: it just seals off certain routes and approaches, forcing you to improvise. It's the basis for a schlocky, Manhunt-adjacent escape room experience, which seemingly offers <em>at least</em> four ways around any given obstacle.</p>

<p>There's no release date yet, but there is a pre-alpha demo. I've just had a quick go, and while I have yet to meet the Lacerator - a roaming nemesis in the tradition of, well, Nemesis from Resident Evil - I am already in need of a new left arm, thanks to a guillotine surprise I really should have anticipated. The branching possibilities of dismemberment aside, The Lacerator feels like an old school survival horror with authentically tanky handling. You can play from a modern, over-the-shoulder perspective, but the true connoisseur/sicko will of course prefer the game's fixed perspectives.</p>
<p>So far, the game's static camera composition feels pleasantly unhinging. There's always a blindspot to worry about, always the monstrous murmuration of something unseen, always the suspicion of an item or terrain puzzle component tucked away in some feculent background surface. You also have an inventory to manage, with consumables including bandages (which restore health, but not limbs) and lockpicks. Given the requisite bodily accessories, Max can punch and kick both the Lacerator and other, maddened prisoners. There are also a few weapons to unearth, such as a pistol.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped in soiled PS1 textures and skin-crawling VHS crackle. There's a choice of graphics options, ranging from "Fucked Up" to "Sexy", but The Lacerator always looks like it's been chiselled off the bottom of a toilet seat. See for yourself via <a href="https://fromtheabyss.itch.io/the-lacerator">Itch</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339330/The_Lacerator/">Steam</a>. It's the work of Brazilian studio Games From The Abyss, whose other creations include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2485080/Death_Elevator/">Death Elevator</a> - a one-hit-kill FPS in which time slows down when you're in danger.</p>
<p>The delicate question you are probably entertaining is: does the dismemberment extend to any actual, you know, members, and what role might Max's... professional fixture play in his escape? DreadXP aren't saying, and I am not going to speculate because I am a coward. If you like the cut of The Lacerator's gibs, I suspect you'll also enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-top-down-indie-horror-game-is-all-about-escaping-monsters-who-have-half-eaten-you-already">Endoparasitic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sad-cat-studios-reveals-13-minutes-of-replaced-in-new-gameplay-overview-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EimYM1xxBys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay overview</a> released today, developer Sad Cat Studios revealed over 13 minutes of footage from Replaced, its anticipated sci-fi platformer.</p>



<p>Today’s overview shows meticulous camerawork that features dynamic reactions to your gameplay, such as “focusing your attention on what matters.” It also teases that players will need to “hide, fight, and even talk yourself out of danger.” </p>



<p>The devs also mention that the combat is “inspired by the Batman Arkham series.” It will focus on countering and reaction, and the game includes “multiple difficulty settings.” </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Replaced: 13-Minute Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EimYM1xxBys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Today’s gameplay overview closes with some details on the free roam aspect of Replaced. The game allows players to explore some open-ended locations “at certain points in the story.”</p>



<p>Replaced does not have a concrete release date at this time. Just yesterday, developer Sad Cat Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed the Replaced launch</a> until sometime in 2025. </p>



<p>Sad Cat Studios did not break down the exact issues. However, the devs cited that “we need more time to ensure we meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves.” They also want to “meet the expectations of our fans.”</p>



<p>The anticipated 2.5D cyberpunk platformer Replaced will be available on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. It’s also coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and it will join the Game Pass. </p>

                <p>You don't need a lot of space to enjoy virtual reality gaming, but a good chair certainly can elevate the experience. That's where Roto is aiming to make a mark, as it recently unveiled what it calls the first gaming chair designed specifically for Meta Quest headsets. Made in partnership with Meta, the Roto VR Explorer is designed to take advantage of the "look and turn" technology in Quest VR headsets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L23jW5mh5sg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L23jW5mh5sg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a nutshell, this allows you to move around a VR environment more seamlessly, a feature that does work well considering that the Quest headsets are wireless. The downside here is that the system doesn't work too smoothly if you're seated, and flicking the analogue stick for quick turns can be jarring. With the Roto VR Explorer chair, you've got a secure seat with 360-degree movement, allowing you to quickly move around environments without having to worry about accidentally booting a pet.</p><p>The other cool feature is that the chair has a built-in rumble pack, allowing it to sync with a dongle connected to your headset, register actions, and send a jolt from the base through your entire body. Roto says the gaming chair is compatible with over 400 games and apps from the Meta Quest store, and for build quality, it has back supports, adjustable seat height, a footrest, cable management, and a high-quality leather finish. It even has a modular design that supports a range of accessories, if you own them.</p><p>Ideally, this should make navigation in games feel far smoother, although the chair will have a hefty price tag of $800. For VR enthusiasts, this could be a good investment for comfy gaming sessions, especially with games like Assassin's Creed Nexus, Synapse, or the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-story-trailer-pits-bat-against-rat/1100-6524019/" data-ref-id="1100-6524019">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>. Preorders are now open on Roto's website, and the chair is scheduled to start shipping out in October.</p><p>If you've been looking to dive into virtual reality, the Meta Quest 3 is arguably the best consumer-grade VR headset on the market right now. It has plenty of power, the controllers are comfortable, and the experience of wireless VR gaming is very fun, especially with games like Beat Saber and Arizona Sunshine 2. There aren't any deals right now, but you can get the entry-level <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 with 128GB of storage capacity</a> for $500.

Then it's your lucky day, because that's precisely what alternative controller game designer Julia Makivic rustled up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Running a through a list of some of her favorite and most despised tiny screens during a fleeting Hyper Talk, Makivic sought to pass on some wisdom to other developers fascinated by the prospect of building video games that incorporate bitesized displays. She explains that tiny screens have become a "huge part" of her process, and that's pretty damn neat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also incredibly frustrating at times, because they weren't designed with video games in mind. "They were designed to maybe display readings from a sensor or other information about the board itself," she explains. "So my whole journey has been trying to adapt these annoying little screens to do what I want them to do–even though they weren't designed for that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, as ranked by Makivic on a bespoke ten-point scale from 'most annoying' at one to 'least annoying' at 10, here are a bunch of tiny screens you might eventually come to cherish or loathe.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ardunio MEGA + Adafruit HX8357 (6/10)">Ardunio MEGA + Adafruit HX8357 (6/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The first project I ever did used the Adafruit library with the HX8357 screen on the Arduino Mega and I would rate this a solid 6/10 experience. It's actually really big for a tiny screen. It's like five inches," says Makivic. "But it doesn't work with transparencies. That's annoying. For sprites and also when it renders images, it renders them line by line rather than the whole image at once. [...] That's not good for practicality. It also has too many pins. Neither SPI or I2C&nbsp;protocols require that many pins."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Picographics + Pico Display Pack /Tufty 2040 (3/10)">Picographics + Pico Display Pack /Tufty 2040 (3/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The next one is the Picographics library with the Pico display.

No," Makivic says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They use this JPEG coding library where you have to have a particular format of JPEG. But they don't tell you what the format is or how to define it. All I know is that when I use JPEGs from ProStudioPaint it likes them but when I use JPEGs from Photoshop it gets mad. That's okay because Adobe is evil so maybe they're right about that."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Adafruit GFX Bitmaps - ST7789 (5/10)">Adafruit GFX Bitmaps - ST7789 (5/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The next one is Adafruit GFX and Bitmaps on the ST7789. Solid 5/10. I liked that the ST7789s are kind of small. They're cute. They are pricey though, but come in round shapes too, which is cool. Also Adafruit–it has good documentation. They will tell you to do what you need to do in order to get the thing you want to do. Excellent. That's a huge plus," continues Makivic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But, one thing you do have to use with these screens is bitmaps. I had to learn what fucking bitmaps were in order to do this. So a bitmap is an array that represents an image. Each value in the array represents a particular pixel in the image. So you have to break that bitmap into a grid and then see when you're going to use that part of the bitmap in a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's cool to manipulate an image on that kind of pixel level. But there might also be an easier way of doing this–I don't know. And just like all of these other screens, bitmaps cannot be transparent. So your white background has to match your game background, and that's just a huge hassle for everyone. Also, I need to know the size, width, and height of the bitmap. I had to do math in order to do this–which like, why? It also gets mad when you try to use too many bitmaps at the same time."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ESP32 + ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01 (8/10)">ESP32 + ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01 (8/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Finally, I would like to move onto the best one. We've left the dark ages where you can't use transparency and entered the modern world where you can use transparency on images. I'm using the ESP32 microcontroller with various screens including the ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01," says Makivic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Honestly, it has been great. It's so easy to use and I recommend it. The only downside is that you kind of have to leave the beginner pool and jump into the intermediate pool. ESP32 is maybe not as intuitive, but it's also really not that bad.

            <p>
The Plucky Squire, one of Eurogamer's most anticipated games of the year, will launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S on 17th September, publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> has announced. 
</p>
<p>
It'll also be a day one launch via PlayStation Plus, for anyone signed up to Sony's subscription service.
</p>
<p>
An innovative 2D and 3D platformer based in and around the pages of a picture book, The Plucky Squire is the first project from All Possible Futures, the indie development studio set up by former Pokémon artist James Turner.

<p>
I got the chance to watch a demo of The Plucky Squire last year at Gamescom 2023 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-ftc-microsoft-acquisition-done-deal-1-1">came away rather besotted</a>. Chris Tapsell then went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-first-hands-on-with-the-plucky-squire-was-one-of-the-most-joyful-experiences-in-ages">hands-on at Summer Game Fest back in June</a>, and dubbed it one of his "most joyful experiences in ages".
</p>
<p>
A mix of 2D and 3D platformers, adventure games, side-scrollers and more, The Plucky Squire follows the exploits of young storybook hero Jot as he leaps in and out of its pages.
</p>
<p>
"The Plucky Squire is joyful and delightful and inventive, but it's also a game that's been made with indisputable care," Chris wrote. "The kind of care that quite literally leaps out of the page."

<p>The DLC will also introduce “new ultimate attacks, animated cutscenes, and a new playable character.” That includes the new team member Metis, an android resembling Aigis. </p>



<p>PlayStation also released a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/15/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-launches-sept-10-hands-on-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog</a> today, elaborating that Metis even claims to be Aigis’ sister, and attacked the dorm to protect her.</p>



<p>Atlus’ new trailer showcases both cinematics and gameplay, including a variety of combat and upcoming mechanics.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-and-delay-revealed.953808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date, but it's landing a little later than you might have expected.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>officially launches across PC and consoles on February 11th, which the studio admits is a "long wait". The game was previously slated to arrive sometime this year.</p>
<p>Despite the extra wait time, Warhorse says there's plenty of stuff on the way to whet your appetite for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, including gameplay footage, a collector's edition, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay-party.jpg?itok=tXb-ZZM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay-party.jpg?itok=Y_X5LJzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fear not, revellers, for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Warhorse PR manager&nbsp;Tobias Stolz-Zwilling <a href="https://x.com/T0_8I/status/1823951710206722306" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;the dev team was "this close" to releasing in 2024, but eventually made the decision that it needed "a tiny bit more time". He also echoes the studio's excitement with regards to what's coming up for&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2</em>.</p>
<p>First up, a showcase demonstrating over 20 minutes of gameplay will air at this year's Gamescom, which is due to start later this month. Following that, the collector's edition of the game will be revealed at some point, and previews from various content creators and press outlets will also begin to appear.</p>
<p>In short, even though<i>&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>has technically been delayed, there should still be plenty to keep you busy between now and its February release date, however far off that date currently seems.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">hugely popular medieval RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the sequel will also revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, and this time he's "caught in a gripping tale of revenge, betrayal, and discovery". Sounds like an average day in 15th-century Bohemia to me.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 11th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

However, Atlus has opted to include all that delicious new shit <em>woven throughout</em> the original game, meaning that to see some of <em>Royal</em>’s best stuff, you have to play through the entirety of <em>Persona 5 </em>again. This means little to those who wait until the definitive editions are out before playing a <em>Persona game</em>—but for people like me who jump on a new one the second it’s out, playing the entire game all over again has always been a big ask.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196394,196055" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s why <em>Persona 3</em>’s <em>The Answer</em> feels like the ideal scenario, looking back on the original PS2 game.

The demon-fighting high school team S.E.E.S. is mourning the loss of their leader following his sacrifice during the final battle, and it seems like they are ready to go their separate ways. That is, until Aigis, the shadow-killing android of the team, meets another android named Metis claiming to be her sister. She attacks the group, and Aigis awakens to the trademarked <em>Persona </em>protagonist power of swapping between different summonable creatures at will to face any foe they might encounter.<br></p><p>Aigis becomes the hero of the story when a portal to a new, shadow-infested world opens below the dormitory, and S.E.E.S. is forced to once again take up arms against the monsters. As the group descends, hoping they can find answers for why they’re being dragged back into the fight, they find a series of procedurally generated floors overrun with shadows. It’s back to <em>Persona 3</em>’s usual dungeon crawling, but there are a few tweaks that make Aigis feel different than the original protagonist.</p><p>The main change is that Aigis, being an android who uses firearms, is able to preemptively attack enemies from a distance, which Makoto from the base game can’t do as a swordsman. However, it does feel a little imprecise and finicky compared to a simple sword strike in the base game. You don’t aim down sights when playing as Aigis, you just wait for her reticle to appear on an enemy when you’re at a close-enough distance. It’s not a foolproof system, and perhaps it will become more manageable with practice, but it definitely sticks out as an early complication.</p><p>Besides that, however, a lot of <em>The Answer </em>seems like more of what made <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> a successful remake earlier this year. It still feels as effortlessly stylish as the main game, its characters are still lovable (even if they’re maybe not as happy to see each other as they once were), and the chain-centric turn-based combat is still full of challenges that it feels like more recent <em>Persona </em>games have gotten away from. I haven’t played the original <em>Answer </em>in over a decade, and I’m excited to revisit it with fresh eyes. <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>brilliantly captured the hopeful melancholy of living for the ones you love, even against terrible hardship. I’m eager to revisit <em>The Answer</em> and see if S.E.E.S. learned that lesson once more when the DLC launches on September 10.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"The development time and costs would not have been manageable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'm really sorry to all of the fans who were holding out hope.</p></div><p>"Persona 3 Reload has just released, and there is currently a lot of player interest, so if we are to do an additional release, it has to be now. But since it is not possible for us to release Persona 3 Reload with the female protagonist in this window, we just can't do it. I'm really sorry to all of the fans who were holding out hope, but it is likely never going to happen."</p><p>Persona 3 Reload is the fourth iteration of Persona 3 (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-4-golden-and-persona-3-portable-will-be-released-on-modern-consoles-in-january-2023">or the fifth if the port to modern consoles is included</a>). The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/25/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-review">base game</a> launched in 2006, followed by an enhanced edition called <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/22/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-fes-review">Persona 3 FES</a> in 2007, and a PlayStation Portable version aptly called <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/06/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable-review">Persona 3 Portable</a> in 2009.</p><p>It was in this latter version the female protagonist was released, so when Atlus announced a full remake promised to be a "complete experience," many fans were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-wont-include-content-from-fes-or-portable-including-the-female-protagonist">it wasn't planning to include FES or Portable content</a>.</p><p>The release model of Atlus, particularly of the Shin Megami Tensei (of which Persona originated) and Persona franchises, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-fans-slam-expansion-pass-as-a-cash-grab">is starting to frustrate some fans</a>. It's common practice for the developer to release the base game and then, a year or two later, released essentially a better version with extra content at full cost. Persona 4 received Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 received Persona 5 Royal.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Persona 3 Reload Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Fans therefore took issue with Persona 3 Reload releasing without this content, not just because it was missing, but because they expected Atlus to release an enhanced edition soon after that would include it.</p><p>Looking to quell those concerns, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-wont-get-an-expanded-golden-or-royal-edition-anytime-soon-dev-says">Wada promised fans in March 2024 that Persona 3 Reload was a "complete experience,"</a> but just one month later Atlus announced an expansion pass. This would add a handful of cosmetics alongside Episode Aegis — a 30 hour epilogue added to Persona 3 FES — but no female protagonist.</p><p>Further frustration came as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-wont-be-sold-outside-the-expansion-pass">Atlus confirmed Episode Aegis wouldn't be available as a standalone</a> but only as part of the $34.99 expansion pass. The "complete experience" promise therefore fell through, with fans actually having to pay a total of $104.98 to play every part of Persona 3 Reload. This still won't include all the Persona 3 content ever released, of course, and seemingly never will, as the female protagonist and other additional content remains locked in Persona 3 Portable.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Multiple new Lord of the Rings games are in the early stages of development, Embracer Group--the company that owns Middle-earth Enterprises--has confirmed. As part of Embracer's <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-828-million/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings briefing</a>, the company said it is "actively testing and prototyping multiple new game concepts."</p><p>Embracer said its efforts in this area include "exploring a wide range of immersive and authentic gameplay within the Middle-earth world."</p><p>The publisher went on to say it will take an "honest and tactical approach" to making these games with an aim of creating "authentic storytelling."</p><p>"We believe that engaging deeply and early with the community is essential to creating experiences that truly resonate," Embracer said. "We have been diligently working with our own creative teams, other world-class creators, and our passionate fanbase in laying the foundation and strategic long-term planning for [The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit]."</p><p>Before this, Embracer's Lord of the Rings boss, Lee Guinchard, spoke about how <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he wants there to be a renaissance for Lord of the Rings games.</a></p><p>Embracer is working with Amazon Games currently on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-lord-of-the-rings-games-on-the-way/1100-6514561/" data-ref-id="1100-6514561">new MMO in the Middle-earth universe</a>. Another upcoming Lord of the Rings game is the cozy-looking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire</a>, which releases later this year. As Guinchard said in the interview mentioned above, there are multiple other new Lord of the Rings games in the works that have yet to be announced.</p><p>There have been many iconic Lord of the Rings games over the years. In particular, some of the early movie tie-ins were well-received, while the more recent Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War were enjoyable as well. On the less-serious side, there are also Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego The Hobbit titles that are fondly remembered. Check out the gallery below to see some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-games-ranked/1100-6503738/" data-ref-id="1100-6503738">best Lord of the Rings games ever.</a></p><p>One not-so-fondly-remembered Lord of the Rings game was The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which came out in 2023 to very low review scores. Following the game's release, developer Daedalic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gollum-studios-next-lotr-game-canceled-dev-no-longer-making-games-at-all/1100-6515620/" data-ref-id="1100-6515620">canceled the next Lord of the Rings game it had in the works and announced it would no longer make any games at all.</a></p><p>Beyond video games, Embracer is working with Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on multiple upcoming films, including The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in Peter Jackson's original The Lord of the Rings series, is coming back to direct this film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA is set to announce the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>release date later today, but it looks like the release date may already have leaked, along with the associated trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823957103859396777" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by Wario64 on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the trailer was uploaded to Streamable in its entirety earlier today. It's not a long trailer, clocking in at around 21 seconds, but it states the release date clear as day at its conclusion: October 31st.</p>
<p>The trailer isn't actually set to air until around 12pm Eastern, so it's possible that someone at EA accidentally set the video to go live at 12AM instead. Hey, mistakes happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=etsmhprc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=2atjFux7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is apparently set to release in late October.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em>) was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">formally unveiled in June</a>, speculation has swirled regarding its 2024 release date, but it now looks like that speculation can be put to rest.</p>
<p>It's been a strange journey for <i>Veilguard</i>. The latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-named-as-next-dragon-age-game">revealed as&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>back in 2022</a>, and the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-reaches-dragon-age-dreadwolf-alpha-milestone">completed its alpha development milestone</a> in October that same year.</p>
<p>Following that, however, BioWare fell relatively silent with regards to&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf</em>, until it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-be-fully-revealed-in-summer-2024">announced in December last year</a> that the game would be fully revealed this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studio held to that promise, and the game, along with its new name, got its first gameplay reveal in June. If you're a long-time&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fan, you might notice some changes around the place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-monuments.jpg?itok=Mz8N7OSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaked-monuments.jpg?itok=Vd09Vu-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>has had a long and strange journey.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">lean further towards action</a> than even its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>did, so if you were hoping for a return to the classic real-time-with-pause CRPG combat for which the first game became known, you're out of luck, sadly.</p>
<p>However, if you're just hoping to start up a loving relationship with one of your companions, you'll be pleased to know they're all romanceable, a move about which&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>creator David Gaider <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-creator-veilguard-romance">has expressed reservations</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>launches on October 31st, if the above leak is anything to go by. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">check out our preview of the game here</a> to find out how it plays.</p>

            <p>I was all set to plunge into Blackbird and Gearbox's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a> this spring when I received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">a slightly underwhelmed intergalactic transmission from Nic</a>, praising the game's atmosphere and story while ruminating over fussy controls and a want of tactical depth. Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles. </p><!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure if <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1840080/eventcomments/4513255804484823645?snr=1_5_9_">today's free Homeworld 3 update</a> is the one I'm waiting for, but it does encompass "a host of gameplay improvements, bug fixes, [and] free Skirmish maps". It will launch alongside the Kalan Fleet pack DLC, which adds two new fleets to the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim's roguelike War Games mode, including the Kalan Raiders from the story, along with three new ships.</p>
<p>The Kalan Raider fleet are a mix of Kalan and repurposed Hiigaran ships. The other new fleet is the Capture Fleet, who blend Incarnate with Kalan vessels - guess what they're good at. If you guessed "stealing other people's frigates", then go away and sulk, for I have no medals to give out. The DLC also includes 11 new challenges and 40 Artifacts. I don't get the sense that all of this will address the complaints I'm reading on the Steam forums about the single player campaign and - oh wow, the current Steam user review consensus is Mostly Negative. Is it <em>really</em> that bad?</p>
<p>Revealed to much rejoicing in 2019, Homeworld 3 has had a troubled gestation. It was repeatedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-delayed-till-may-to-incorporate-player-feedback-to-war-games-demo">delayed to address player feedback</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-the-homeworld-3-devs-are-improving-the-game-after-delaying-release-over-demo-feedback">the controls proving a particular bugbear</a>. Creators Blackbird <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-studio-blackbird-interactive-hit-with-layoffs">laid off staff in February this year</a> following some unannounced project cancellations.</p>
<p>According to Blackbird's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-dlc-plans-revealed-alongside-collectors-edition-with-model-spaceships">season pass roadmap from April</a>, we can expect another paid Homeworld 3 DLC in October which adds a new playable faction, starting fleets, faction artifacts and challenges. There's also a further free update in the works with maps and challenges for around the end of the year. A third paid DLC pack and free update combo are planned for 2025, with a similar balance of goodies.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine all that moving the needle of player reactions to the story campaign, but still - best of luck, Blackbird. This is deep space survey ship USG Evans-Thirlwell, signing off until further notice.</p>
<p><em>Little update: the game's Steam user review consensus was Overwhelmingly Negative at the time of writing but had changed to Mostly Negative soon after publication. Given the timing, I've decided to change the headline and body copy to suit.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, developer Warhorse Studios announced that its anticipated sequel Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will launch on February 11, 2025. </p>



<p>Fans originally expected the game to release sometime in late 2024, following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-releasing-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak on IGN</a> in April 2024. </p>



<p>However, today’s post also included details on future reveals, including the developer’s plans for Gamescom.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios confirmed it will reveal a new gameplay showcase for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 with over 20 minutes of footage. This will release on August 21, along with a playable version, first impressions, and a Collector’s Edition reveal. </p>



<p>Fans got a small glimpse of the Collector’s Edition box during the video accompanying today’s release date announcement post.</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first gameplay trailer</a> for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 during Summer Game Fest 2024. </p>



<p>Although the devs acknowledged that February is “a long wait,” they also pointed out that it lines up with the release week of the first Kingdom Come. Fans remain patient and supported plans for a smooth launch.</p>



<p>Last month, Martin Ziegler of Warhorse Studios offered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some in-depth details</a> on the making of the game during a new interview. They revealed behind-the-scenes efforts to create something as authentic and immersive as possible.</p>



<p>Ziegler added that “we’re introducing many iterative changes to the combat,” aiming to add more depth and make it more accessible too.</p>
