            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-5th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time for another gaming business roundup, and this week, we've got green initiatives in gaming, as well as another round of acquisitions, more layoffs, and some slightly sobering losses for a couple of studios.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's been happening this week on the business end (so to speak) of the gaming industry!</p>
<hr><h2><em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>dev Arc System Works opens a new branch</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-system-works-gaming-business.jpg?itok=_wMSp7bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-system-works-gaming-business.jpg?itok=tjpwHzki 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Arc System Works now has a European presence.</figcaption></figure><p>Arc System Works, best known for fighting games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime">Guilty Gear</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BlazBlue</em>, opened a new branch this week, expanding its operations to Europe for the first time.</p>
<p>Catchily named Arc System Works Europe, the branch is <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.fr/en/news/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">based in Paris</a>, and its first endeavor is the European release of upcoming anime and manga tie-in game&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact</em>, which is coming to PC, PS5, and Switch later this year.</p>
<h2>Green initiatives abound in the gaming industry</h2>
<p>The environmental impact of game development is an issue that's becoming more and more pressing for the industry. Whether it's developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-dev-claims-gaming-nfts-are-harmful-to-game-design-environment">commenting on the harmful nature of NFTs</a>&nbsp;or indie devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saltsea-chronicles-climate-report">sharing reports on their climate impact</a>, the green question is one that pressingly needs to be answered.</p>
<p>This week, two new initiatives sprung up that aim to contribute to this conversation.</p>
<p>The first, Make Green Tuesday Moves, sees not-for-profit <a href="https://www.planetplay.com/mgtm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">climate organization Planet Play</a> bringing new DLC to games like&nbsp;<em>Avakin Life&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Subway Surfers&nbsp;</em>in order to highlight green initiatives and projects. The org's first partner is none other than 80s legend David Hasselhoff.</p>
<p>This week also saw the launch of the <a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sustainable Games Alliance</a>, a non-profit dedicated to making the gaming industry "the leader in sustainability" by setting new goals for environmental responsibility.</p>
<h2>Layoffs and losses</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-gaming-business.jpg?itok=YTvb-cxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-gaming-business.jpg?itok=hxHwvSZZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, the gaming industry is still looking a little gloomy, and that means some studios made layoffs this week, while others reported somewhat sobering losses that should give us pause for thought.</p>
<p>In the world of layoffs,&nbsp;<em>Watch Dogs: Legion&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Toronto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-lays-off-30-ubisoft-toronto-devs-so-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laid off around 30 employees</a> earlier this week, ostensibly an effort to "deliver on its ambitious roadmap". I'm not much of a fan of that kind of wording.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also confirmed layoffs this week</a>, letting around a dozen employees go and pointing to a "difficult time in the games industry" as its reason.</p>
<p>Two major companies also announced losses this week, the first of which was&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2&nbsp;</em>studio Techland, which <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1809128485043978480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lost around $25 million last year</a>.</p>
<p>It joins workhorse studio Tose, which <a href="https://x.com/gosokkyu/status/1808819444178956649" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revised its projection</a> for the financial year ending in August from a 20 million yen profit to a 450 million yen loss owing to the cancellation of projects by some of its partners, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">likely including Square Enix</a>. This one hits particularly hard because Tose hasn't posted a loss in 20 years.</p>
<h2>More acquisitions</h2>
<p>This week has also seen a number of studios being acquired or gaining new investment, beginning with legendary iconoclast Devolver Digital, in which publisher Kwalee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/kwalee-makes-minority-investment-in-devolver-digital" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now owns a 3.58% stake</a>.</p>
<p>Keywords, a large "technical and creative solutions provider" that counts studios like Hardsuit Labs and High Voltage among its roster, was <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34403122&amp;company=keywords" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired this week</a> by newly-formed UK company Houting UK for a whopping £2.2 billion (roughly $2.81 billion).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Capcom announced that it has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240701.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired two thirds</a> of CG production company Minimum Studios' shares, and sports media company Sporty Group <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sporty-group-acquires-sociable-soccer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Sensible Soccer&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Sociable Soccer</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Also in the industry this week</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warlander-publishing-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Ez23F1uk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warlander-publishing-gaming-business.jpg?itok=LzSyx8eI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warlander&nbsp;</em>is being published by its developer now. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>We've just got time for a little look at some of the other stories that have been circulating in the gaming industry this week.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of MOBA-come-hack-and-slash-RPG&nbsp;<em>Warlander</em>, you'll be pleased to know developer Toylogic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675900/view/4246413199423327840" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took over its publishing duties</a> this week, and if you love military warfare games, then&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks Blitz&nbsp;</em>passing $1 billion in revenue is sure to tickle you.</p>
<p>We also took a detailed look at two major stories in the industry:&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition">being acquired by Daybreak</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>studio Cloud Imperium being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">ordered to pay compensation</a> to a disabled employee over a discrimination claim.</p>
<hr><p>That marks the end of another gaming business roundup! There's lots to chew over this week, but make sure you join us again next week, when we'll be taking another look at the industry and all its goings-on.</p>

When used in tandem with the Lighting and/or Frenzyflame perfume bottle, the build was able to evaporate enemies pretty quickly, and in some cases, it’d even one-shot them. </p><p><strong>Spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss follow.</strong></p><p>This build became a particularly popular tool for players who were stuck on the DLC’s final boss fight against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-radahn-final-boss-tank-all-hit-run-1851566306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-radahn-final-boss-tank-all-hit-run-1851566306">Promised Consort Radahn</a></span>, who hits like a goddamn truck and kind of demands you use a cheese strategy—which are often dubbed cheap tricks because they rely on overpowered builds or exploiting something wrong with the game.</p><p>Now, players need to go back to defeating Radahn the good ol’ fashioned way. The update also nerfs the Swift Slash Ash of War (thank goodness) due to its <em>over</em>-effectiveness in PvP, as well as the new thrusting shield weapons, which began to take off in popularity. Guarding while attacking with them wouldn’t consume <em>that </em>much stamina, allowing players to spam attacks on the thrusting shields with little consequence.</p><p>While many new weapons were nerfed, the Carian Sorcery Sword actually had its Intelligence scaling tuned up higher, though its general attack damage was knocked down a bit. This should make it more powerful to use spells via the sword, while appropriately nerfing its raw damage, since that’s rarely the move for anyone prioritizing the Intelligence stat.</p><p>Though weapons are the focus of the balance changes in this patch, it also makes life a little easier as far as two of the DLC’s more demanding boss fights. Both Commander Gaius and the Golden Hippopotamus have had their spawn point fixed. Now, they should begin in a fixed point a fair distance away from the fog gate entrance, so as to not obliterate the player too quickly, which has become a common complaint among players for most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-boss-difficulty-combos-1851560177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-boss-difficulty-combos-1851560177"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s boss encounters</a></span>.</p><p>And so <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840">FromSoftware</a></span> giveth, but it also taketh away. Given the cadence of these updates, I’d expect a few more balance changes over the next few weeks before the developer decides everything is in its rightful place.

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1809239858587586624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gematsu</a>, a new <a href="https://x.com/tite_official/status/1809237306882089286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from the official Tite Kubo account hints that Bandai Namco could announce a new Bleach game during Anime Expo 2024.</p>



<p>Tite Kubo is popular for their work on the iconic source material, and their post confirms Bleach will appear at Anime Expo. It also teases the Bandai Namco Summer Showcase at Petree Hall, suggesting the two are related.</p>



<p>This is a fairly vague tease that does not officially confirm a Bleach game will appear. Still, Gematsu also pointed out a recent trademark filing for Bleach: Rebirth of Souls, filed last month.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1807936302140252559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that its Summer Showcase will return today, July 5, 2024, at 5:30 pm PDT. Fans will also be able to view the event on YouTube and Twitch. </p>



<p>In the same thread, Bandai Namco only confirmed some playable games for the event. Those will include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream, and Gundam Breaker 4.</p>



<p>With Bandai Namco potentially adapting Bleach into a game, some fans already speculate it could resemble Sparking Zero. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero recently got a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for October 11, 2024</a>, and Bandai Namco <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed its game modes</a> last month.</p>



<p>At this time, Bandai Namco has not issued a statement about a potential Bleach game or its appearance at the Summer Showcase.</p>

                <p>Coffee Stain Studios has revealed the launch date for its factory-building simulator, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a>. After several years in development, the 1.0 version of Satisfactory will launch on September 10, and to mark the occasion, Coffee Stain has released a new trailer celebrating the release date <em>and</em> confirmation of a sought-after feature that will be added in the 1.0 release: premium plumbing. At long last, players will be able to tinker with adding an advanced flushing mechanism in their personal space. And that stain is <em>not </em>from coffee.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=febekpSoEbA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/febekpSoEbA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Satisfactory was first revealed in 2018 and made its early-access debut in 2019. Available initially on the Epic Games Store, it eventually made its way to Steam and it received several substantial updates--including a shift to Unreal Engine 5--alongside hundreds of smaller tweaks. If you haven't heard of it, imagine a first-person take on Factorio where you string together machinery and assembly lines to exploit all the natural resources on an alien planet, like some sort of Rube Goldberg machine powered by late-stage capitalism.</p><p>Up to four players--or pioneers as they're called in the game--can band together to turn a natural paradise into an industrial hub, although they'll have to deal with hostile alien lifeforms and frequently research new technologies to keep their factories running. In early access, the game has sold over 5.5 million copies so far and it has built a dedicated community of pioneers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/05/house-of-golf-2-preview-minigolf-meets-micro-machines/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s two types of golf games out there: those that take themselves very seriously and try to be like big boy golf, and those that are in it for all manner of silly shenanigans, taking much more inspiration from minigolf in the process. House of Golf 2 is definitely in the second camp, combining minigolf with Micro Machines for something that you might like to call microgolf.</p>
<p>What’s that? You wouldn’t like to call it that? Well… to each their own, I guess.</p>
<p><iframe title="House of Golf 2 Announcement! (PS5, Xbox X/S, Steam, Epic)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mneUYgQGTAA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The fundamentals of House of Golf 2 are pretty similar to the menagerie of other minigolf games that have teed off in recent years –&nbsp;your Golf With Friends, and your Golf Gang, and all the rest –&nbsp;as you are represented purely by a ball in the game world, pick a direction and strength, then tap to send the ball flying in that direction. It’s far less technical than a PGA Tour game with multi-tap shot power, spin and all the rest –&nbsp;that said, a pull back to power option is there in the options for those that want it.</p>
<p>Outside of that, though, the Micro Machines inspiration and parallels are clear through the environments. Each hole takes place in a room from the titular House of Golf, and the course is defined by a mix of real-world objects for set dressing, and custom ramps and elements to help join things up. Compared to the leaning toward low complexity graphics and cartoony visuals, they’re using Unreal Engine 5 to give House of Golf 2 more of a premium feel.</p>


<p>It also gives you oil slicks and puddles of PVA glue, in classic Micro Machines fashion, but there’s a few other gameplay elements thrown into the mix as well. Big cannons can suck you in and shoot you out if you get into their radius, there’s boost pads to speed you up, portals, and even cranes that can come along, pick you up and then drop you off somewhere else. Just beware of hazards, like remote control diggers going round in a loop, which can easily push you out of bounds.</p>
<p>The way that each track is laid out with the realistic world objects also leaves plenty of gaps and places to get a bit creative with your shot selection. Sampling the opening few courses from the game, anyone with a keen eye will spot the tactically placed rubber that acts as a mini ramp to kick you up in the air for a chance at a hole in one, or the gap behind an open laptop that can skip a tricky half pipe. Heck, there was even a shot I took simply from spinning 180º at the tee – oh, and you can pick the spot within a tee box that you want to start from.</p>

<p>This game will absolutely be best enjoyed with friends, and while there’s sadly no support for online multiplayer, four-player couch multiplayer will be there from the start. Aside from that, regular leaderboard competitions will be held, and together with collecting medals within the stages, will reward you with a bunch of custom ball skins to show off.</p>
<p>Really, the only complaints I have are that Mulligans are a bit too powerful, the limited use ability to retake a shot penalising your trick score, but making it feel a bit too easy to get a low shot count. Combine that with the aforementioned shortcuts, and I feel for the level designers and artists who put plenty of work into arranging all the game assets for holes that zig and zag and sprawl all through a room, only for some jerk like me to immediately spot and use a shortcut on the first go.</p>

<p>It’s not the zaniest minigolf game out there, but If you’re looking for that next hit of minigolf to satisfy your needs, then House of Golf 2 should absolutely be on your watchlist for later this month. It’s coming out for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 25th July.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi says he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14.</p>
<p>At last month's Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that - after a period of Apple exclusivity - Sakaguchi's latest game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creators-fantasian-heads-to-switch-after-apple-exclusivity">Fantasian, was finally coming to Switch</a> under the banner of his former employer, Square Enix.</p>
<p>It marks the first time Sakaguchi has worked for his former studio in over 20 years.</p>

<p>"I felt if I kept too close of a relationship, then it might actually affect how Square Enix treats Final Fantasy," Sakaguchi told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-03/-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-reunites-with-square-enix?srnd=technology-vp">Bloomberg</a>, reflecting on why he had intentionally kept a distance from Square Enix and the games he'd created for over two decades.</p>
<p>But as the franchise neared its 30th anniversary, Sakaguchi was asked to participate in panels and interviews, and "that's when [Sakaguchi and Square Enix] started to meet up" and "grew closer".</p>
<p>When he was asked to attend a Final Fantasy 14 event back in 2021, Sakaguchi "loaded up the game" to see what it was like.</p>
<p>"It started off as a courtesy," he said. "Now I almost live in Final Fantasy 14."</p>
<p>Sakaguchi has sometimes been caught playing instead of attending work meetings. "On a rare occasion - I want to stress 'rare occasion' - sometimes one of the Mistwalker team members will hop on Final Fantasy 14, and I'll see a message saying, 'Hey, the meeting's started'," he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, this means Sakaguchi has also spent some quality time with Final Fantasy 14 producer and director, Naoki Yoshida. But given the time away from the franchise, Sakaguchi's keen to maintain a professional distance from the series he created because he's essentially now "switched to a consumer rather than a creator".</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>
<p>Talking of which: Final Fantasy 14 director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for "issues" identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

            <p>The space industrialism of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> is distinct from other efficiency sims about making endless conveyor belts in two important ways. One: it's a mash-up with the first-person survival genre that sees you stranded on an alien planet, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. Two: there is a dedicated coffee cup item from which you can leisurely sip. It's been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-review-early-access">rather good</a>. We knew developers Coffee Stain were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-five-years-in-early-access-satisfactory-will-finally-launch-into-10-later-this-year">planning a 1.0 release this year</a>. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say. The complete version will include flushable toilets, a "much sought after addition to the game", we're told.</p>

<p>We still don't know exactly what fresh stuff will be included in the final version (aside from flushable loos, I mean). But a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTxziQw8fJQ">previous video update</a> from the developers promised "yet-to-be-seen content, fixes to some of the long-lasting issues we've had in the game, and a way to complete the game along with a narrative." Ah! Closure! I've heard that's really pleasant.</p>
<p>It has already seen a number of big updates since its earliest incarnation on Epic's store, to be fair. Since then the developers have added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-update-4-is-out-now">hoverpacks</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactorys-update-6-revamps-weapons-creature-ai-and-exploration">boomboxes</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-now-lets-you-create-blueprints-and-play-in-peaceful-mode">peaceful mode</a> that renders alien creatures non-aggressive. They added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-adds-trains-and-nuclear-environmental-disaster">huge trains</a> in an early update. Then gave the trains signal lights <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-adding-train-signals-train-timetables-and-train-crashes">so they wouldn't crash</a>. In other words, it has grown a lot since those first few belts of raw metal were gloriously stripped from the outstanding natural beauty of whatever this planet is called. What, you think I have time to learn a planet's name? I'm busy pumping all the water out of this river.</p>
<p>Satisfactory has sold more than 5.5 million copies, say Coffee Stain. Which feels well-deserved. Though I haven't been keeping track of it since it came to Steam in 2020, I did perversely enjoy my time stripping the alien planet of its materials like a horrendous capitalist pig. Where Subnautica makes you feel like an intruder in its ecosystem with an almost moral obligation to do as little harm as possible to its coral reefs, Satisfactory goads you into embracing an endless hunger for efficiency, until the landscape is covered in conveyor belts and the once-beautiful sky is full of smog. It feels unusually self-aware. </p>
<p>It also has one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cars-in-videogames">my favourite cars in video games</a>. And, in a stroke of summer luck, it is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">half price in the Steam Summer Sale</a>. At that cost it's pretty much an insta-recommend for anyone who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/zachtronics">Zachtronics</a> games, or  other automation sims. With the caveat, of course, that you will likely lose weeks of your life to it. </p>

The post is mostly about upcoming changes to the game’s many jobs, but in the intro Yoshida takes a second to thank Warriors of Light for exploring <em>Dawntrail</em>,<em> </em>and reveals the good news about player numbers. “With your support, we were able to reach a record number of concurrent users we’ve not seen since the release of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> in 2013,” he writes<em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417"><em>A Realm Reborn</em></a></span> was the relaunch of <em>FF14 </em>after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yes-final-fantasty-xiv-really-was-this-bad-the-first-t-1789996867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yes-final-fantasty-xiv-really-was-this-bad-the-first-t-1789996867">1.0 release</a></span> was shuttered at the end of 2012, although Yoshida doesn’t give any specific figures.</p><p>The news is pretty shocking to me, considering the variety in reception to <em>Dawntrail</em>. The expansion is something of a new beginning for the MMO, after wrapping up a decade-long story with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span><em> </em>in 2021. Rather than the universe-ending threats Warriors of Light have faced in the past couple of expansions, <em>Dawntrail </em>is a return to good-old-fashion adventuring, this time through the Latin American-inspired locale of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-turalism-site-rhys-darby-1851564573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-turalism-site-rhys-darby-1851564573">Tural</a></span>.</p><p>The new content has lower stakes than previous expansions, and makes the player a supporting character, allowing focus to shine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954">on new character, Wuk Lamat</a></span>. Due to these changes, the expansion has been incredibly divisive. Not to mention that unless you purchase a story and level skip, as a new player you won’t be able to dive right into the supposed “new beginning” of the MMO. I can’t quite figure out what it may be about <em>this </em>expansion that got everybody and their mother to play, as opposed to more critically beloved and widely talked about expansions like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span>. </p><hr><p>In any case, I’m happy to see the over-a-decade-old MMO thriving. Hopefully a good portion of these new and returning players stick around for whatever is to come after <em>Dawntrail</em>’s fresh start.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every year, players break good games and perform wild acts of digital acrobatics as they do speedruns for a good cause. And the best good thing was the goodest of good boys Peanut Butter, a four-year-old Shiba Inu, hitting a home run in <em>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball </em>on Thursday, July 4.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191404" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Suddenly, Everyone Wants To Remake Dead Space" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="129" data-playlist="191404,196923,196922" data-current="191404"><div><p>Suddenly, Everyone Wants To Remake Dead Space</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191404/191404_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191404/191404_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191404/191404_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191404/191404_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17318.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Peanut Butter and his owner JSR_ took the Summer Games Done Quick stage to swing a virtual bat around until the dog won a game for the event’s Independence Day show. The duo had a modified controller that essentially is a big button made to look like a baseball. A simple press of the device from Peanut Butter would throw a ball or swing a bat—as JSR_ fed him treats, PB pressed the button and played the game. The two have been part of Games Done Quick before, having participated in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684">Awesome Games Done Quick 2024</a></span> with a <em>Gyromite </em>run back in January, but they were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agdq-2024-dog-peanut-butter-speedrun-gyromite-twitch-1851170011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agdq-2024-dog-peanut-butter-speedrun-gyromite-twitch-1851170011">part of a remote speedrun</a></span>. This time, they were in the Minneapolis Hilton venue, and while Peanut Butter was distracted at a few points by his surroundings, he was mostly locked in for the game.</p><p>The whole setup relies on a combination of timing and chance. JSR_ tries to direct Peanut Butter to press the button just as a ball nears the batter, but it’s all dependent on if the sweet baby angel puts his paw down in time. There were definitely some ill-timed swings in the run, but everyone was rooting for the little king as he entered extra innings. And Peanut Butter managed to end the segment in glorious fashion by hitting a homerun to win the game. Of course, the Minneapolis crowd (and social media) went wild.</p><p>“I am so proud of this dog, man,” JSR_ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JSR2gamers/status/1809080297612341405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JSR2gamers/status/1809080297612341405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “This is the greatest moment of both of our lives. What a doggo.”</p><p>Summer Games Done Quick still has two more days of speedruns before it wraps things up on July 6, but the event has raised a cumulative $50 million in its 14-year history. Games Done Quick has raised money for different nonprofits over the years, including AbleGamers, the Organization for Autism Research, the Malala Fund, and the Prevent Cancer Research Foundation. This year’s Summer Games Done Quick is raising money for Doctors Without Borders, a nonprofit that delivers medical aid to people in crisis. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1809218861524201713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1809218861524201713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As of 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time</a></span>, this year’s event has raised over $1 million for Doctors Without Borders. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nothing beats the feeling of creating some content or playing games with premium equipment, and this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZYQW23?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech keyboard and mouse bundle</a> is a prime example of that feeling. Normally priced at $210, this set has been discounted to less than half that and is just $99 at Amazon. It includes a Logitech G Pro wired TKL mechanical keyboard and the excellent Logitech G502 mouse. Alternatively, you can pair the keyboard with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro wireless gaming mouse</a>, which is discounted to only $55.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329192-logitech-keyboard-and-mouse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329192-logitech-keyboard-and-mouse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329192"></a><figcaption>Logitech G Pro TKL keyboard and G502 mouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329192-logitech-keyboard-and-mouse.jpg"></figure><p>First off, the keyboard here is a solid slab of high-performance inputs. Its compact size makes it great for lugging around to events or taking up minimal space on your desk. It has a long 1.8 meter detachable cable, and GX Blue switches for solid and satisfying keypresses. Like other Logitech devices, you can install the free and official G-Hub software to play around with the lights on the keyboard.</p><p>The other highlight here is the G502 gaming mouse. This is an excellent mouse at this price, and since it looks like a Decepticon from the Michael Bay Transformers movies, there's more than meets the eye with this slick piece of hardware. It has a super-sensitive 25K sensor with 1:1 tracking, which allows for super-smooth movement and acceleration.</p><p>Thanks to the 11 customizable buttons, you can assign a wide variety of commands to it and the mechanical switches make it satisfying to click around with. The only drawback here is that this is the wired version, and its shape makes it awkward to use if you're left-handed.</p><h2>Logitech gaming deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329193-logitech-g-pro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329193-logitech-g-pro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329193"></a><figcaption>Logitech G Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329193-logitech-g-pro.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QQB9VCV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro TKL mechanical keyboard</a> -- $60 ($<strike>130</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro gaming mouse (wireless)</a> -- $55 ($<strike>130</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G502 mouse (wireless)</a> -- $86.40 ($<strike>150</strike>)</li></ul><p>If you're just looking for a mouse, there are some great options here, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless Logitech G502</a> is on sale for almost half its usual rate at $86.40 and the more compact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro</a> is currently available for an absurdly low $55 instead of its regular price of $130.

                <p>Capcom has announced that it is ending Exoprimal's seasonal updates as Season 4 comes to a close. However, online servers will remain functional and previous seasons will be rotating through the game monthly.</p><p>Season 4 ends on July 11, and then Seasons 1, 2, and 3 will return in a rotating order every single month. Additionally, Season Passes 1-3 will be available for sale again, which allows players to obtain items from all seasons.</p><p>All gameplay modes will still be available to play as well, including end-game content like the Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion. If players are alone or matched with only a few other players, AI-controlled bots will be added so that they can still fully experience the campaign and see the ending.</p><p>Exoprimal has seen several content updates and collaborations with other Capcom properties like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/exoprimal-monster-hunter-collaboration-gameplay-trailer/2300-6462780/" data-ref-id="2300-6462780">Monster Hunter in Season 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/exoprimal-official-mega-man-collaboration-trailer/2300-6463823/" data-ref-id="2300-6463823">Mega Man in Season 4</a>.

<p>As ever, a new character will also debut in this version: Emilie, a 5-star Dendro polearm wielder and perfumer. She's got a unique damage-over-time ability called the Lumidouce Case, which can be upgraded to deal extra damage if enemies are Burning.</p>

            <p>They get knocked down, but they get up again, and you’re apparently never going to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> studio CCP Games from trying to make an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the universe of their Excel(lent?) MMO happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-vanguard">EVE Vanguard</a> - the studio's admirable fourth crack at it - was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">last September</a>. Since then, it’s had several open betas and, according to a new and rather vague roadmap, should release sometime post this coming November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CCP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, the roadmap as it stands is effectively a yawping gap charting the time between now and the last open beta event, although there are a few details for plans (though not dates) moving forward. The wishlist includes establishing more economic links between the shooter and their long running MMO, which I still find very cool conceptually despite having no real interest in either. Also planned are more weapon customisation options, “diverse environments”, more progression options, and “expanded gameplay elements” which, y’know, you’d hope so yeah.</p>
<p>The intervening time between now and November-ish will also host a bunch of closed founder tests and dev diaries, culminating in a major update on the 16th of November.</p>
<p>As noted, EVE Vanguard is only the latest in a series of attempts at grafting a standalone shooter to the wildly successful and undeniably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-accidental-jump-later-one-of-eves-biggest-battles">storied</a> MMO. Dust 514 launched in 2013 for PlayStation 3, and shut down a few years later. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-legion-fps-announced">Project Legion</a> was announced in 2014, but never saw the light of day. In 2018, CCP were kind enough to fly me to Vegas to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-project-nova-2018">show off Project Nova</a>, but that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ccp-cancel-project-nova-but-havent-given-up-on-an-eve-online-shooter">canceled in 2020</a>. Vanguard has neither numbers or the words ‘Project’ in the title, so maybe it’ll fare better?</p>
<p>Last October, Julian Benson wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">why CCP haven't stopped trying to make an EVE Online shooter for 15 years</a>. “I can’t say if Vanguard will be what the team’s looked for for so long, but it has two things going for it that give it a greater prospect of success,” wrote Benson. “EVE Vanguard is described by CCP as a module of EVE rather than its own game, not because they run in the same engine but because you launch both through the same client. CCP are trying hard to make sure even if Vanguard develops its own player base, they will be well aware of its ties to EVE Online. Secondly is the ‘vE’ in Vanguard’s PvPvE’s pitch. Even if you were the only player in the world who booted up Vanguard, there would be a game for you to play.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NIS America has announced the&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest entry in the long-running JRPG franchise is making its way to the West in fall.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>launches on October 25th, and it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation. Sorry, Xbox owners; it looks like you're missing out on another JRPG.</p>
<p>All versions of the game will include both Japanese and English audio, and the PC version will go one step further by including a Japanese text option as well, just in case you prefer Japanese or you're trying to brush up on your language skills.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ys-x-nordics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=0R2vHGsU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ys-x-nordics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=bDw5UCCj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>is finally making its way to the West in October.</figcaption></figure><p>A Western release window for&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>was announced in February (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-western-release-window">on Valentine's Day, funnily enough</a>), but it's nice to know the game likely isn't getting delayed to 2025 or anything drastic like that.</p>
<p>Instead, October will bring what NIS America describes as "a milestone entry in the legendary&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series", complete with a new story to uncover, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-new-english-trailer">naval exploration</a> to engage in, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-character-trailer">new party members to meet</a>.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-reveals-tons-of-spectacular-action-jrpg-gameplay-ys-viii-figures-announced">fast-paced action combat</a> in which you can control protagonists Adol and Karja separately or team them up for devastating combo attacks.</p>
<p>Along with the release date announcement, NIS America has also released a brand new trailer to show off&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>and what you can expect when it lands in October. You can check that trailer out here.</p>

<p><em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>adventure to be coming to the West in the next year or so, either.</p>
<p>Recently, publisher Xseed Games revealed a Western release for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-for-switch-gets-english-trailer-but-its-not-what-you-think"><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em></a>, an HD remaster of 2005's&nbsp;<em>Ys: The Oath in Felghana&nbsp;</em>(which is itself a remake of the third&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>game).</p>
<p>You can check the trailer for that Western release out right here.</p>

<p>While you wait for that one to arrive,&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em>launches in the West on October 25th. You'll be able to pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007199" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Nintendo Switch.

            <p>Sony has revealed a new range of figurines called "The Shapes Collection" that includes characters from God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with toy company Spin Master, Sony says the "highly detailed figures deliver the interactive storytelling element of these titles in an all-new way, extending the gaming experience from digital to physical".</p>
<p>The six-inch figures themselves "take inspiration from details in each game", and include interchangeable accessories and "dozens of points of articulation to pose and display".</p>

<p>First up is a "deluxe" <a href="https://gear.eu.playstation.com/Product/1549530-Sony_Play_Station_6_ALOY?cat=SPIN#frm%3DSPIN%26p%3D0">Aloy</a> figurine, which can be pre-ordered now for a not-insubstantial £48. As well as Aloy herself, you'll get 12 accessories, including multiple face plates and alternative hands.</p>
<p>The accompanying Varl figure – as well as figurines based on Ghost of Tsushima's Jin Sakai and God of War's Kratos and Atreus – will open to pre-orders soon for a more palatable £29. These will have 24-34 points of articulation and two to four accessories, depending on the character.</p>

<p>As lead character artist at Guerrilla, Arno Schmitz, explained, the figurines are based on "the actual digital sculpts used for the game", and the development team worked with the figurine manufacturer to ensure "the many articulation points made sense and even the finest textural detail shows up on the figures".</p>
<p>"A personal highlight was the ability to provide different facial expressions for Aloy, which, together with those many articulation points (even her hair has some!), make her a very poseable figure," Schmitz said. "Also, the technique used to apply colour to the faces meant we were really able to maintain the likeness of actual models, something that was very important and adds a lot to the appeal of these figures."</p>
<p>Pre-orders are expected to ship from next month (August 2024).</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will soften the blow to Horizon fans who recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-series-no-longer-moving-forward-following-showrunner-allegations-report">Netflix's plans to produce a Horizon Zero Dawn series are "no longer moving forward</a>".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24191461/playdate-ereader-app-playbook-panic-teenage-engineering<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader">the Boox Palma</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24140675/light-phone-2-one-year-retrospect">the Light Phone 2</a>, it seems that everyone is looking for distraction-free reading, if only they had the right device. I don’t blame them: every time I pull out my phone to mindlessly scroll, I know my time could be put to better use. But as the owner of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">many fine gadgets</a>, I also don’t really want another device in my life, so I was pretty excited to stumble upon a partial solution with a gadget I already have: the Playdate.</p><div><p>Yes, I’m talking about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">little yellow Game Boy from Panic and Teenage Engineering</a>, the one with a crank jutting out of its side. Since the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">its on-device store</a>, Catalog, the handheld has become home to quite a range of experiences. I’ve been playing tiny <a href="https://play.date/games/mega-dystopia-micro-architect/">city builders</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/under-the-castle/">dungeon crawlers</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/touch-egg/">egg touchers</a>. Even still, I was surprised to discover <a href="https://play.date/games/playbook/">Playbook</a>, a full-fledged e-reading app. Perhaps even more surprising is that it actually works pretty well.</p></div><p>The app comes with a handful of classic books preinstalled, and I tested it initially by reading through most of <em>Frankenstein</em>. The Playdate’s black-and-white LCD screen is pretty great for displaying text, which shows up crisp and clear. The drawback is that it has no backlight for reading at night, and the screen is tiny. At one point, a single one of Mary Shelley’s sentences took up the entire display.</p><div><figcaption><em>Long sentences can take up the entire screen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Andrew Webster / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But, like the device itself, the app is also very charming. You can scroll through books using the crank, which is weird but fun in a tactile way (you can also use the D-pad instead). And instead of telling you what percentage of the book you’ve read or how much time you have left, Playbook has a candle that serves as a progress bar, slowly burning down as you read. It’s less scientific, but much more cozy, with the flame flickering every now and then.</p><p>There are missing features — there’s no way to jump around in a book without scrolling, for instance, and you can’t highlight passages — but the biggest hurdle might just be getting books onto your Playdate. It’s not as simple as syncing your Kindle library. Instead, you have to connect your handheld to a computer, put it in USB mode, and then drag and drop files into the right folder. Before that, you have to convert .epub files to .txt, which is relatively painless.</p><p>To test this, I grabbed a bunch of ebooks from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, including <em>Dracula</em>, <em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em>, and <em>The Turning of the Screw</em>. (In retrospect, my choices may have been influenced by the idea of reading by virtual candlelight.) Everything I added to the app worked just fine, with the exception of <em>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</em>, which caused my Playdate to crash every time I tried to open it, presumably because it’s so large.</p><p>Now let’s be real: a $5 Playdate app is not going to be your one-stop solution for reading more. It hasn’t been for me. I still keep a Kindle on my bedside table and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@andrewwebster/post/C82SB5Tv54Y">carry paperbacks wherever I go</a>. But just as the Playdate serves a complementary role, offering unique games that aren’t meant to replace a Switch or PlayStation, so, too, does Playbook.</p><p>The app isn’t my main tool for reading. But it works well enough and — crucially — is convenient enough that it’s great to have around in a pinch. Having a library of classic novels on a device the size of a credit card comes in handy — and, if nothing else, it’s helping keep me from buying another gadget.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom have announced that there will be no further new live service content seasons for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a>, the rad dino-slaying co-op shooter which everybody adored except for stinky RPS reviewer Edders, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exoprimal-review">branded it</a> "dull repetition for most" and castigated the game for its "baffling disrespect for one's time". Are you reading this, Edders? Look what you did. Look what you did. I hope a massive planet-extinguishing asteroid flies out of nowhere and lands in your tea, you Triassic tryhard, you blundering diplodocus.</p>

<p>"With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content has been finished," reads <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/">a teary-eyed post</a> on Capcom's official site. After the game's current, fourth season concludes on 11th July, the game will loop back to its first season, with season 2 seemingly to follow the month after. Exoprimal is, in other words, going into the live service equivalent of suspended animation, much like the velociraptors and other species of terrible lizard who erupt from portals within the game's rewindable testfire scenarios. You can follow the loop and plan your future visits to Exoprimaland using <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/other_20240705_001/">this schedule</a>.

</p><p>The developers are at pains to state that nothing is being taken away. "All gameplay modes will remain available to play," the post continues. "This includes the main Dino Survival mode, as well as endgame content such as Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion." There will also still be online bot support in the event that Exoprimal's never hearty playerbase wilts away to nothing.</p>
<p>If I'm honest, I agree with many of Ed's arguments about Exoprimal's repetitiveness, and to be fair to Ed, there were a few things he liked. In an unusual gamble that evidently hasn't paid off, Exoprimal hides a lot of its more enjoyable multiplayer features and scenarios behind plot points, and the surprise of discovering them is all the greater for the mild tedium of getting there, though I had a lot more fun with the Overwatchy class dynamics than Edders did. Perhaps if Exoprimal had sold better, Capcom could have taken some similar risks with the seasonal updates, rather than just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exoprimals-roadmap-reveals-a-crossover-with-monster-hunter-meaning-fantasy-dinos-are-on-the-table">adding skins from other Capcom games</a> and glaring silently whenever anybody utters the words "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> reboot". I guess we'll never know.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure if this applies in other countries, but in England we have this thing where you'll stroll down some random suburban street without a care in the world, and stumble on a house that has been absolutely overrun by garden gnomes. A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.</p>
<p>A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horticular">Horticular</a> is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Horticular is the work of developers inDirection Games and publisher Slug Disco, who were kind enough to send over a preview build. (There's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928540/Horticular/">a less substantial demo on Steam</a>.) I've played about 30 minutes, and good news, Xbox-360-loving sickos, this is sort of Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-hit-them-with-a-stick-and-candy-falls-out">Viva Pinata</a> but with isometric pixelart visuals. And gnomes. 
</p>
<p>
You start with a square patch of arid soil, and must set about converting it into a merry little garden by excavating terrain tiles to make lawns, ponds and flowerbeds, then introducing twee plants and props to attract critters such as bumble bees, goldfish and frogs. The more kempt and bountiful your garden, the more gold you'll earn to spend on construction together with upgrades, such as a metal detector for your shovel cursor, and new terrain types or plantables, such as fenceposts and flowing water. 
</p>
<p>
The music is affable, plinky-plonky stuff and the gardening elements are both restful and sinister in the context of the surrounding badlands, which are dotted with rocky ground you can't cultivate without upgrades, and various wizened, ever-so-slightly Lovecraftian curly trees. What do the gnomes want with this place? Apparently it's a source of magic. Why is it in such a hellish state? Well, the previous gnome overseer, Nightshade, has gone missing, and now there's some kind of Corruption at work that periodically blackens your plants and renders terrain tiles unusable.
</p>
<p>
There is ample room here for a Twist of some kind, augured by the ominous hush that descends at night. It Turns Out Your Cuddly Gnome Friends Weren't So Cuddly Or Friendly After All. Perhaps Nightshade is the secret hero of the piece, a cranky subversive hoping to overturn some interplanetary gnome extraction corporation, rather than the villain he's obviously framed as.</p>
<p>I personally would <em>never</em> trust a gnome, but again, as a rambling Englisher I have had too many surprise encounters with houses where the lawn ornaments have undergone a viral population explosion. Perhaps you like gnomes! You should probably try that demo, then. Horticular is out less than a week from now on 11th July 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-zenless-zone-zero-offer-controller-support-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I completely understand the desire to lazily slouch in your computer chair with a comfortable controller in hand instead of hunched over a mouse and keyboard. Some games just feel better with a controller, even on PC. So, does Zenless Zone Zero offer controller support? Let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-with-a-controller">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero With a Controller?</h2>



<p>You absolutely can, and perhaps should, play Zenless Zone Zero with a controller. It offers full controller support for both Xbox and PlayStation peripherals, thanks to its simultaneous launch on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>To use a controller in Zenless Zone Zero, ensure you have one connected to your PC before launching the game. ZZZ should automatically pick up on the input and swap controls automatically for you. But if you want to tweak the controller layout, you can find everything under the game’s settings. Hit “ESC” on your keyboard, then navigate to “Options” and “Input.” </p>



<h2 id="h-zenless-zone-zero-controller-controls">Zenless Zone Zero Controller Controls</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Interact</strong>: A</li>



<li><strong>Basic Attack</strong>: X</li>



<li><strong>Special Attack</strong>: Y</li>



<li><strong>Dodge</strong>: A</li>



<li><strong>Ultimate</strong>: RT</li>



<li><strong>Previous Character</strong>: LB</li>



<li><strong>Next Character</strong>: RB</li>



<li><strong>Chain Attack </strong>– Left: LB</li>



<li><strong>Chain Attack </strong>– Right: RB</li>



<li><strong>Lock</strong>–<strong>On</strong>: RB</li>



<li><strong>Run</strong>: A</li>



<li><strong>Inter</strong>–<strong>Knot</strong>: Y</li>



<li><strong>Messages</strong>: RT</li>



<li><strong>Travel</strong>: RB</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-better-with-a-controller">Is Zenless Zone Zero Better With a Controller?</h2>



<p>I would argue that Zenless Zone Zero is profoundly better with a controller. The action combat feels more fluid and responsive with an Xbox Series X|S controller in my hand than it did when I was using the mouse and keyboard. To repeatedly click to slash enemies felt bland, honestly.</p>



<p>But with a controller, it’s like you’re more in control of your character and their movements instead of just a third-party taking the reigns.</p>

		<p>Capcom has confirmed that Season 4 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a> will be its last, winding down the live service support for the over-the-top co-op dino shooter.</p>
<p>However, Capcom isn’t just leaving the game to fester, unchanging until the ends of time – or more accurately until the servers are turned off. No, they will instead start to cycle through the previous seasons, giving players the chance to work through the reward paths and obtain any items they might have previously missed. Season passes for all seasons will be on sale.</p>


<p>Season 4 concludes on 11th July, after which Season 1 will return. From there on, a new season will begin on the first of each month – So Season 2 in August, Season 3 in September, and so on. Exoprimal will also have routine missions cycling through on a weekly basis, which brings the&nbsp;Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion endgame modes in and out of the playlist.</p>
<p>See Capcom’s <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/other_20240705_001/">Exoprimal FAQ</a> for all the timings and details.</p>
<p>Exoprimal launched in July of last year, taking the team-based hero shooter and twisting PvE and PvP elements together to create one heck of a strange gameplay hybrid.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/24/exoprimal-review/">Exoprimal review</a>, Dom said, “Exoprimal is a multiplayer shooter with bags of potential. A good round has all the thrills of Overwatch’s PvP wrapped up with the brain-massaging mayhem of Earth Defense Force or Dynasty Warriors, but it’s so slow about getting you invested that some players might simply never get there.”</p>

		<p>As all manner of companies have pushed to find the next steps in personal computing over the past decade, there’s been a tussle between augmented reality and virtual reality for supremacy. Do you want to be fully ensconced in a rendered environment and cut off from the rest of the world? Or is it better to place objects within our living spaces, analyse the world around us and overlay them with more information and detail? For video games, it’s been clear that VR is the more appealing technology, but what if you blend the two together? That’s what Infinite Inside seeks to do, the next game from Maze Theory.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Infinite Inside kicks off with a suitcase falling into your living room, busting open and sprouting a strange stone pillar right in front of you. As you get up and walk around it, you spot gaps or handles for drawers to pull out, revealing 3D shapes that you can grab and then piece together to create a whole. Slotting those completed puzzle blocks into gaps in the front of the plinth eventually reveal little trophy-like statue that, as you grab it, whisks you away from the real world and into an entirely virtual setting.</p>


<p>Talking about the game’s inspirations, Maze Theory’s Chief Gaming Officer Russ Harding told us, “We always ask, when we play with new tech, what can we do now that we couldn’t do before? For us and our previous backgrounds working in VR and AR, combining the two elements together was something that we hadn’t been able to do before. We hadn’t been able to take you from your real world with augmented reality objects and then unlock a virtual world and take you in and out of that space. That felt quite unique and exciting for us to explore.</p>
<p>“Taking away controllers, what can you do just using hand interaction? How do you get around spaces? How do you pick things up?”</p>


<p>Now, it’s important to note that Infinite Inside is coming to all major VR platforms and catering to all their various capabilities. The game on SteamVR and PlayStation VR 2 will have a fully rendered VR living room as the hub, instead of using augmented reality, while Meta Quest 3 and Pico will blend reality predominantly with controller in hand. However, Infinite Inside launches alongside the Apple Vision Pro in Europe next week on 12th July, and that puts a rather different spin on things.</p>
<p>“We predicted ages ago that there would be an Apple headset,” Russ said, “and we wanted to be a part of the launch of that headset, but one of the things we couldn’t predict was how the UI/UX would work on Vision Pro until we got our hands on it. I think that once we did through some of the Workshops, we realised one of the most challenging things would be translating the controller or analogue hand interaction back into the UI/UX of Apple.”</p>
<p>Having gone hands-on with the game on both Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, the distinction is clear. Going controller-less on Quest 3 is possible, but the default will be to use the bundled controllers for hand tracking, reaching out and grabbing things with grip buttons and triggers, while on Apple Vision Pro you need to adapt your expectations and interactions away from what’s so common in other VR platforms. It’s more about looking and performing a pinching between finger and thumb – though you can still reach out and grab things, just performing this different action.</p>
<p>It’s fortunate that Infinite Inside is so well suited to this style of play, a much more relaxed and considered experience compared to high-octane shooting galleries and energetic rhythm action games. That allows the strength of the passthrough and augmented reality of this headset to really shine, and even ties in with the style of Apple’s own immersive environments.</p>
<p>“Obviously the passthrough is really high quality, you don’t get any warping [around your hand], it makes you feel very present and it really embeds objects in the world. It has things like dynamic lighting, where it takes on light from the room, which is difficult to see if you have a very bright room, but you do get those subtleties, and is a really nice touch.”</p>

<p>As you’re whisked away to a virtual scene, the interaction changes from pacing around your living room to one that’s perhaps a little more familiar to VR gaming. Locomotion is kept very simplistic here;&nbsp;there’s no free motion or slingshot teleportation, but rather floating stones on set paths that you reach out towards and grab to teleport around. Through this you explore a maze-like stone structure, searching for the plinths and places where you can once again physically investigate them, open draws and search for the puzzle pieces you need.</p>
<p>The story is kept light and minimal, but Russ told us that “There is a narrative in the world, as the plinth that arrives in your room has been created by a secret society, the character that you keep seeing in the game is one of the founders, and you kind of get to learn a bit about what that society is about.”</p>
<p>“There’s no voiceover in the game, and you’ll notice that as you go in and out of each chapter, you’ll get a very slight touch of story through the titling of the chapter as it’s introduced. It’s very much about experiencing the progression as you go through the plinth itself and start rebuilding it. You get hints of the echoes and their story.”</p>
<p>It amounts to a game that’s on the smaller and more constrained end of the scale, compared to Maze Theory’s previous games with the Doctor Who license and Peaky Blinders: The King’s Ransom. “Peaky really pushed the boundaries of our art production pipelines,” Russ said, “and for us that’s why we have a very stripped-back and focussed style for Infinite Inside.</p>
<p>“We’ve also tried to focus on just a few mechanics rather than lots of mechanics. We have been utilising App Labs to push out demos and stuff – we have a prototype team that pushes out prototypes to App Labs, so we’ve got a game on there at the moment called Freerunner that’s just looking at movement systems. Some of those we take into other games, but the idea is that we get community feedback. With infinite Inside, we put the demo out with the first two levels (obviously in alpha) and that was really well received. We got feedback about the traversal stones, how people were interacting with puzzle pieces, and it was really interesting to get that feedback.”</p>

<p>And getting a community that’s engaged is more important than ever for game developers – Russ proudly touts the 4.9/5 rating the Infinite Inside demo has garnered on App Laps. Yes, being on Apple Vision Pro is what’s drawn the headlines, but that’s the gateway for talking about the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>Russ told us, “For us, it’s really important that we do go out on everything – of course, it’s very demanding on our team. […] In VR we’re spread across platforms as an audience, and it’s a much smaller audience, so we need to be able to penetrate that successfully. Arguably a lot of platforms have been encouraging and supporting one another, supporting developers to go cross-platform, because sales on one will help sales on another. As an industry, if you can make a bigger noise on release, the better it is.”</p>
<p>Infinite Inside is out next week on 12th July across Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, Pico, SteamVR and PlayStation VR 2.</p>
