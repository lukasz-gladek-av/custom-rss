<p>The story behind the recent layoffs at 10:10 Games is more than just a case of simple restructuring. Insider Gaming has spoken to multiple sources who have provided new details about what led to the layoffs at the Funko Fusion developer, what they were told, and more.</p>



<p>According to those who spoke under the condition of anonymity, staff at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/details-funko-fusion-developer-1010-games-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found out about</a> the layoffs in mid-January and that there would be 19 jobs at risk. Those who were being let go were told by management that they would be “fully supported through this process”, including assistance with finding more work. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>As far as those let go, some were on Holiday—which the company had encouraged them to take. After being told while out of work, those let go were still expected to attend consultation meetings at the given time. That included those that happened to be abroad in different time zones.</p>



<h6>PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-playstation-doing-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is PlayStation Doing? — Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>“Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board,” one source said.</p>



<p>Once layoffs were finalized, meetings wrapped with those affected by the end of January. In those meetings, Insider Gaming learned that they were told there would be no real severance package. What they received was what one called “the bare legal minimum” that included notice periods and payment in lieu of any unused Holiday time. As mentioned above, Holiday time was encouraged to be used over the holiday season. </p>



<p>Many of those spoken to believed that the company knew they were going to be holding these layoffs and w anted to avoid paying it out after the fact.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-reason-given-to-10-10-games-staff">What Was The Reason Given To 10:10 Games Staff</h2>



<p>After the layoffs were announced, employees were—obviously—wondering what led to the decision. It’s understood that it all stems from 10:10 Games’ first release, Funko Fusion.</p>



<p>Sources say that Funko Fusion was a “complete commercial and critical failure”. Because of the poor performance of the game, the studio has failed to secure funding for more than one future project as of now. That led to lower-level staff being told that there “isn’t enough work to give the whole team”.</p>



<p>Layoffs were said to be based “entirely on the needs of the next project” which many who spoke to Insider Gaming believe hasn’t been  fully designed yet. It’s also believed that no senior-level or upper-management staff were impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that studio heads Paul Flanagan and Arthur Parsons initially told staff that they wanted to “own” the layoffs and take responsibility when it became public. However, the studio instead has passed it off to an external PR company with no official public statement on the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to contact 10:10 Games for response to what has been said regarding the layoffs. As of publishing, a response has yet to be received.</p>

The word spire is fairly vague, as it could be a physical building or something formed by nature. </p><p>Fortunately, you don't have to go too far from Thirdborn to find the missing cartographer in Shatterscarp. The cartographer is located to the east of Thirdborn, just above the large "Shatterscarp" text on your map. Go past Sailor's Rest until you reach a small island with a cylindrical boulder sticking out on top of it. Jump over the gap to reach the island and find the missing cartographer. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4444317-avowedscreenshot2025.02.14-01.02.02.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4444317" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4444317-avowedscreenshot2025.02.14-01.02.02.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4444317"></a><figcaption>The map location of the missing cartographer in Shatterscarp</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4444317-avowedscreenshot2025.02.14-01.02.02.64.png"></figure><p>The missing cartographer's name is Wilfrith, and their body is lying against the spire. You can loot Wilfrith's body for some valuable loot as well as pick up Wilfrith's Map that's sitting right to the left of them.

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> now awash with creepy dolls and luridly magenta jumpsuits courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-crossover-for-early-next-year">recent Squid Game collaboration</a>, Activision's FPS is ready for another pop culture invasion, this time from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.
</p>
<p>
The turtles' imminent arrival in Black Ops 6 and Warzone isn't, admittedly, that much of a surprise, given dataminers revealed as much a while back. But now, following in the footsteps of Shredder - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnts-shredder-slicing-and-dicing-his-way-into-call-of-duty">debuted in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone</a> back in 2023 - Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael are all officially on the way.
</p>
<p>
Activision shared the news by way of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmFLpEiKyE">brisk teaser trailer</a>, featuring the fraternal foursome emerging from beneath a manhole located on a palm tree-lined (and slightly smouldering) city street. Beyond the fact they're "coming soon", details are scarce - but expect them to arrive as part of Black Ops 6's incoming Season 2 Reloaded.

<p>
This mid-season refresh doesn't have a  release date yet, but we do know it'll introduce a remastered version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a>'s skatepark-themed Grind map. Promotional art for Season 2 has also previously teased the arrival of dual-wielded katanas, nunchucks, skateboards, and more - all of which would serve as an appropriate accompaniment for those (not traditionally trigger-happy) heroes in a half-shell.
</p>
<p>
The turtles have, of course, enjoyed something of a resurgence in recent years. 2023's Mutant Mayhem movie went down a storm and is getting a sequel in 2026; video game-wise, though, last year saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-shows-off-its-platform-brawling-in-first-trailer">launch of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</a> - to regrettably middling reviews - and there's also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pre-registration-begins-for-tactical-rpg-mecharashi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-registration window is officially open on PC, iOS, and Android for Mecharashi, a free-to-play tactical RPG that puts you in charge of outfitting and deploying a squad of mech pilots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time hearing of Mecharashi, it’s developed by BlackJack Studio and is focused on strategy and tactics. Every mech, both yours and your enemies’, is made up of four parts: a body, legs, right arm, and left arm. Each part has its own separate HP, and reducing each part to zero brings about different results.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/1-2-1738961819330.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"The core gameplay of our game is inspired by Front Mission," the dev team told IGN. "When we reviewed the design brilliance of Front Mission, the most striking revelation came from its groundbreaking choice in 1995: while other strategy games of that time were fixated on the rock-paper-scissors style of counter systems (e.g., “sword &gt; axe &gt; spear”), it boldly abandoned this easy-to-grasp approach. Instead, it introduced part destruction to create a truly physically meaningful battlefield."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mecharashi, destroying each enemy’s body is the ultimate goal, since that finishes them off for good. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you should focus all your attacks on that one area. Taking out the legs makes them unable to move, and as each mech’s weapons are equipped on their arms, destroying those can drastically reduce their firepower and prevent powerful charged attacks. You need to assess the threat each enemy poses, figure out the best way to neutralize them, and use the strengths of each member of your squad to make that happen.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/11/4-2-1739308239640.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have adopted the charming tactical chess logic from Front Mission because it fits perfectly with the mecha + tactical chess theme," the dev team said. "The strategic dimension has been significantly enhanced: Instead of focusing on memorizing attribute counters, players now rely on more realistic logic — destroying legs to limit mobility, breaking weapon pods to eliminate threats, and hitting the cockpit to disable combat capabilities. Each decision corresponds to tangible tactical gains."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Destroying different parts won't just have a strategic effect on battle, you'll also see visual differences depending on what part you destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We used the 3D standards of this generation to create mechs with realistic metal textures, dirt, and scratches. When a mecha's leg is destroyed, not only does it affect the movement range, but you can see the details of the broken surface and internal spark short-circuiting — visual depth that was hard to achieve under the technical limitations of 1995."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each pilot in your crew belongs to a character class that defines their role in battle. Fighters are melee specialists who have powerful attacks but limited range. Raiders use assault weapons to deal high burst damage. Snipers attack from range and can target a specific part of the enemy. Tacticians can also attack from longer distances and hit multiple targets at once. Guardians protect allies and limit enemy movement. And last but certainly not least, Machinists can repair allied mechs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/11/2-1739308844194.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can customize every pilot’s mech — including their individual parts, weapons, and color scheme — and can assemble various bodies, arms, and legs, which affect the mech’s appearance and stats. Different weapons provide different types of attacks from different ranges. Color schemes give you the option of choosing from more than 120 colors, and you can mix and match several colors at once to fully customize the look of each mech.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Front Mission hasn't had a new tactical chess game in many years, and mecha is a highly visual genre," the dev team said. "The realistic textures of mechanics and metals have strong visual appeal. Therefore, we invested a huge amount of art resources into the design of mechs and the construction of the world atmosphere."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/6-1738961874690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve equipped your squad to your liking, it’s time to deploy. You’ll be given missions in the gritty setting of Milkhama Island, where the discovery of a new mineral known as Arashium has led to factions forming and trying to secure it for themselves. And what does that lead to? You guessed it: violence and war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as a mercenary squad recruited into the government’s National Defense Force to help put down a rebel group known as The Ashes, but you’ll quickly realize that not everything is as it seems. As the story evolves, you’ll deal with corruption, complicated politics, deceit, and betrayal, and you just might become key players in a struggle that will change the course of history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story develops through fully voice acted chapters and sub-chapters, with each sending your team on a mission. Before each mission, you’ll have the chance to choose your combat party and their starting positions on the map. Combat is turn-based and progresses in phases until you’ve completed the designated goal for that mission. Those goals can include eliminating all enemies, destroying one specific enemy, or reaching a designated evacuation zone.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/3-1738961919918.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each mech has a movement limit and attack range, which are displayed as different colored blocks on the grid-based map. Some character classes and weapon types provide unique abilities that require a certain amount of AP to use. Each character starts combat with 3 AP and replenishes some on each turn, but many attacks require more AP than a unit can gain in a single turn, meaning you’ll need to bide your time to strategically build up your AP reserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Destroying enemy mechs will grant AP to whoever dealt the finishing blow, so part of your strategy will revolve around AP management to make sure each party member can consistently contribute without wasting any turns. You’ll also need to pay attention to enemy mech types and weapons, since they can counterattack if you hit them from a range they’re equipped for.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/5-2-1738962013730.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once your goal is completed, you’ll receive rewards and each member of the combat party will gain EXP. Rewards include Arashium, mech parts, weapons, Recruitment Tokens, money, and items you can give to specific party members to instantly give them EXP. Arashium is a special currency, while Recruitment Tokens are used to recruit new members for your squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between battles, you’ll return to your base, where you can upgrade your mechs and pilots. During the course of the story, pilots will unlock the Bionic Computer, which essentially acts as their personal skill tree. You’ll need to gather specific items in order to unlock each node, which can provide things like stat boosts, passive skills, and combat abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Mecharashi sounds like it’s up your alley, you can go to <a href="https://mecharashi.tentree-games.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official website</a> to sign up for pre-registration now on PC, iOS, and Android. It’s scheduled to release internationally later this year and will support eight languages: English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Thai, and Chinese. If you'd like to be part of the community, you can follow the game on <a href="https://twitter.com/mecharashi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mecharashi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In a talk at this week's D.I.C.E. Summit <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via PCGamer</a>, an industry conference took place where the theme was sustainability. At this talk, Obsidian Entertainment VP of Operations Marcus Morgan and VP of Development Justin Britch said that they want Obsidian Entertainment to make it to its 100th birthday. Considering the rocky state of the game industry at present, this seems like something that is highly unlikely. However, Obsidian Entertainment does have a history of making incredibly popular games, such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds, and most recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/"> Avowed</a>.</p>
<p>Obsidian is currently 22 years old, which means that the company has a further 78 years to go. The VPs think that this is incredibly doable as long as they stick to the ideas of staying lean, keeping talent, and setting realistic sales expectations. Compared to other companies, Obsidian is more focused on making games that sit well with the players and have an impact rather than focusing solely on the amount of money it can make.</p>
<p>One of the main pillars in the plan for sustainability is staying "lean and invested," with the company remaining small enough so that none of the employees at the company feel like a cog in a machine and still feel human and impactful in the company. However, it wasn't always this way, as Morgan and Britch stated that they had considered opening up studios internationally but decided not to go ahead with it in the event it weakened Obsidian's pre-existing work culture.</p>
<p>Instead of funneling all of the company's money into a single project, hoping that it will make a massive profit, Britch says that the studio spends time determining how much to invest in the project based on the assumption that it will be a "mild success," rather than a smash hit. This is something that companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft could learn from, as they have both recently funneled money into two major projects (<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-staff-says-game-was-referred-to-as-the-future-of-playstation/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, respectively.) with neither turning out quite the way they wanted.</p>
<p>While no names were mentioned during this talk at the D.I.C.E. Summit, there are some very clear examples that come to mind. Namely, the sales expectations of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game didn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/">perform nearly as well</a> as EA and BioWare were expecting. As a result, EA laid off staff at BioWare.</p>
<p>Thus far, from the three titles Obsidian Entertainment released in the 2020s, the company has been largely successful with its efforts. Both critics and the general audience have received Grounded, Pentiment, and Avowed positively.</p>
<p>If the company continues on this straight and narrow path, it stands a good chance of making it to its 100th birthday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-and-amd-both-plan-to-launch-more-affordable-gpus-in-february-and-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 are both very fast graphics cards—if you can look past the possibility that we may have yet another power-connector-related overheating problem on our hands. But the vast majority of people (including you, discerning and tech-savvy Ars Technica reader) won't be spending $1,000 or $2,000 (<a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-gv-n5090aorus-m-32gd-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-gddr7/p/N82E16814932760">or $2,750 or whatever</a>) on a new graphics card this generation.</p>
<p>No, statistically, you (like most people) will probably end up buying one of the more affordable midrange Nvidia or AMD cards, GPUs that are all slated to begin shipping later this month or early in March.</p>
<p>There has been a spate of announcements on that front this week. Nvidia announced yesterday that the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">previously introduced at CES</a>, would be available starting on February 20 for $749 and up. The new GPU, like the RTX 5080, looks like a relatively modest upgrade from last year's RTX 4070 Ti Super. But it ought to at least flirt with affordability for people who are looking to get natively rendered 4K without automatically needing to enable DLSS upscaling to get playable frame rates.</p>

<p>That said, if the launches of the 5090 and 5080 are anything to go by, it may not be easy to find and buy the RTX 5070 Ti for anything close to the listed retail price; early retail listings <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-5070-ti-listings-appear-on-us-and-eu-retailers-some-at-nearly-double-the-msrp">are not promising</a> on this front. You'll also be relying exclusively on Nvidia's partners to deliver unadorned, relatively minimalist MSRP versions of the cards since Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version.</p>
<p>As for the $549 RTX 5070, Nvidia's website <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/">says</a> it's launching on March 5. But it's less exciting than the other 50-series cards because it has <em>fewer</em> CUDA cores than the outgoing RTX 4070 Super, leaving it even more reliant on AI-generated frames to improve performance compared to the last generation.</p>

The steps you take to join with random strangers or team up with friends are rather different, though, as Wilds makes you jump through several hoops to add friends to your in-game list. Full cross-play might be a big step forward for Monster Hunter, but if you're holding out for cross-progression as well, you'll have to keep waiting.</p><p dir="ltr">We've broken down how Monster Hunter Wilds' cross-play works below, including what you need to do to play with friends.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How cross-play support works in Monster Hunter Wilds</h2><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds supports cross-play between PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, and since it has cross-play turned on automatically, you don't have to do anything special to get started. There are separate processes for playing in groups of random players or joining with friends, though. When you join or post a quest, Monster Hunter Wilds puts you in a lobby with up to 100 other players. You can join any posted quest or wait for others to join yours.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1733089281" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

You need to invite friends from your platform's friend list or use a link code Wilds generates for you, and once they've joined your party, you can add them to your Hunter Friends list. The steps involved might change in the full release, but during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-week-extended-due-to-psn-outage/1100-6529350/" data-ref-id="1100-6529350">Wilds' open beta</a>, you could do that by:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Opening the communications tab</li><li dir="ltr">Choosing Link Party</li><li dir="ltr">Clicking a friend's name in the Link Member section</li><li dir="ltr">Sending a friend request</li></ul><p dir="ltr">They'll stay in your Hunter Friends list after they accept the request.</p><p dir="ltr">Inviting friends from other platforms comes with additional steps. You can send them your Hunter ID, which lives under the Hunter Profile menu in the Info tab, or invite them using their ID. The steps in the beta were:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">In the Communication menu, choose Player List and Hunter ID Search</li><li dir="ltr">Input your friend's ID</li><li dir="ltr">Choose their name, and send a friend request</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The method might change in the full launch version, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Speak to Alma, the quest manager, at your campsite to post a quest, and any friend in your party will instantly receive the notification and a prompt to join.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is there cross-save progression in Monster Hunter Wilds?</h2><p dir="ltr">Capcom said Monster Hunter Wilds will not support cross-save progression. All DLC, story progress, and character data will remain locked to the platform where you first start playing Monster Hunter Wilds, so if you pick it up on a different platform, you'll have to start over.</p>

			<p>The Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year in Review</a> is now available, providing a look back at 2024, as well as sharing what's to come this year, including some of the most anticipated features of the store and some massive game releases. While there are a fair number of PC gamers who don't favor the Epic Games Store, the community has continued to grow to more than 295 million PC users (up by 25 million from 2023) and a total of 898 million Epic cross-platform accounts (up by 94 million from 2023.)</p>
<p>Additionally, players are more engaged with games than ever before, with the grand total being amassed to 2.68 billion hours of playtime with third-party games in 2024. With the use of Self-Publishing Tools and opt-in programs being available to up-and-coming developers, the Epic Games Store saw the catalog expand by a whopping 1,100 new games. Even for those who don't want to purchase games, the free games program provides a lot of new and fun titles for those who add them to their library, spanning from triple-A titles to hidden indie gems.</p>

<p>December was a significant month for the storefront, with <span>74 million MAU (Monthly Active Users). This was likely boosted thanks to the holiday sale (there's a new Winter sale <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-winter-sale-live-now-massive-discounts-for-many-great-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live now</a>, by the way) and the free games </span>given away to celebrate the festive season. In total, Epic offered 89 free games over the span of 2024, with 595 million free games being claimed by EGS users. This led to a total value of $2,229 per player, with a 76% average critic score across all free games provided.</p>
<p>As Epic Games continues to grow and flourish, it has been confirmed that the Free Games Program will continue to run on both PC and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently launched mobile store</a>, allowing players to experience games on handheld devices that they previously wouldn't be able to access.</p>
<p>While most PC gamers purchase their desired titles on Steam, $1.09 billion was spent by PC players in the Epic Games Store, with $255 million spent on third-party PC games available in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Looking toward the rest of 2025, Epic has some major plans for the year ahead. This includes focusing on the Epic Games Store Mobile App, which will allow for an enhanced App Library and Discover Experience with an ever-increasing catalog size. For the developers, there will be AAB file type support.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the storefront has continued to nurture new developers and help them publish games on the app, the store will also add mobile self-publishing tools, which are currently available on an invite-only beta. Some big PC games will be coming to the Epic Games Store this year, too, including Splitgate 2, 33 Immortals, Killing Floor 3, Borderlands 4, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/make-a-splitscreen-only-splinter-cell-demands-hazelight-boss-even-as-ubisoft-double-down-on-open-worlds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares has called upon Ubisoft to make a splitscreen-only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> game - a move that even I, with my absolute lack of business acumen, recognise as being comparable to demanding that Cadbury start making chocolate bars out of soot. He thinks it would be a "guaranteed success".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm not saying I dislike the idea of splitscreen Splinter Cell. Ubisoft's ancient military stealth series has decent form for co-op sneakery, with players of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory teaming up to synchro-stab the soldiery. But come now, Master Fares. I know you've got to uphold your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-takes-two-devs-are-making-a-new-co-op-game-called-split-fiction-coming-march-2025">reputation for slashing up displays</a> but please, have some dignity. Imagine the grim faces of the Splinter Cell faithful when Yves Guillemot rolls out footage of a splitscreen-<em>only</em> iteration, 12 years since the last one. Imagine the dozens of green laser dots slowly appearing on Guillemot's face. Imagine the glisten of a thousand karambits being drawn from utility belts.</p>
<p>"Other publishers aren't doing this, and it's crazy to me," Fares commented in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-director-josef-fares-says-ubisoft-is-struggling-and-should-make-a-co-op-splinter-cell-game-dont-chicken-out-to-do-single-player-just-say-this-is-split-screen-only/">GamesRadar</a>. "So many people are playing these games, and people love them. I mean, I'm looking at Ubisoft, and they're struggling now, and I hope someone [from there] listens to this interview, but why aren't they taking Sam Fisher and doing a split-screen-only game?</p>
<p>"Don't chicken out to do single-player; just say this is split-screen only," he went on. "Boom, that's it. You have success, and I can guarantee you that they will sell a huge amount of copies of that. Yeah, they don't even have to do it the Hazelight way; why don't they listen to this [interview] and be like, 'Oh, he's right.' That's a guaranteed success for them; it's for you, Ubisoft. You can get it for free from me."</p>
<p>It occurs to me that it's been such an age between Cells that some of you probably don't know or can't recall the premise of Splinter Cell. Here is a quick recap: there is a grumpy man in black pyjamas called Sam Fisher, with three green torches stuck to his head. Sam's job is to creep into places, stick knives and silenced bullets in terrorists, do the splits over hallways, and maybe hack a computer or deactivate a bomb. You'd think the terrorists would see Sam coming, given that he dresses like a broken traffic light, but somehow he always gets away with it, the scamp. Also he's voiced by Michael Ironside, who sounds like a sexy chainsaw.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have been working on a Splinter Cell reboot since 2021 - "rewriting and updating" the story for new players, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-be-rewriting-and-updating-the-story-for-todays-players">job posting put it in 2022</a>.  We've heard zilch of substance since, and Ubisoft's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">mass layoffs</a> suggest that they're in no mood to release anything as specific in its appeal as a stealth game. Let alone a stealth game that can only be played by two people sitting on the same sofa - as if sofas even exist any longer, in these days of live servicing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/">literally just told their investors</a> that they'll be doubling down on two "verticals" going forward: more of those online game-as-a-service things, and open-world action-adventures. Still, perhaps Yves Guillemot will find time amid efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">sell the company</a> to infiltrate Hazelight's offices and empty a bin over Josef Fares's head.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course Zelnick couldn’t talk specifically about <em>GTA 6</em>'s online multiplayer—which has yet to be revealed by Rockstar—but he did cite an old NBA game as example of how Take-Two has a track record of supporting games that people are still playing. </p><p>“I’m going to speak theoretically only because I’m not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn’t been made. But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles,” said Zelnick. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As an example, we launched<em> NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012 if I’m not mistaken. And then we launched<em> NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online</em>. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they’re alive and we have this massive audience.</p></blockquote><p>Zelnick continued, “So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p>While the Take-Two boss didn’t outright say “<em>GTA Online</em> will keep getting updates after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span> launches,” it’s pretty clear what he’s suggesting here. If <em>GTA Online</em> has a large enough audience still playing, the game will likely get more updates. I do wonder how Rockstar North—the main studio behind <em>GTA</em>—would balance that with supporting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em> </em>and any online modes it might include. Would Rockstar tap other parts of the company to support <em>GTA Online</em>, or maybe even an outside studio to take over maintaining and updating the aging crime MMO? <em>GTA Online </em>still makes a lot of money, and Take-Two ain’t going to walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars. </p><p>As for <em>GTA 6</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">earlier this month Zelnick seemed very confident</a></span> that the next title in the series will launch in fall 2025, telling <em>IGN</em>: “Look, there’s always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like ‘absolutely,’ you jinx things. So we feel really good about it.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-wasn%E2%80%99t-at-state-of-play.1109814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PlayStation State of Play from February 12 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">littered with announcements and trailers</a>, but nothing from Bungie about their upcoming PVP extraction shooter, Marathon. Marathon was one of a few prolific titles that weren’t featured, leaving fans confused as to why Bungie’s first big project post-Destiny wasn’t shown.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-was-marathon-not-at-state-of-play">Why Was Marathon Not At State of Play?</h2>



<p>According to Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb, Marathon wasn’t shown because Bungie is probably going to hold their own showcase event for it, likely in April of this year. During yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8&amp;t=1980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Mess Decides show</a>, Grubb said that this decision falls right into the Bungie playbook.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new Marathon game, not to be confused with the older Marathon trilogy from made by Bungie in the 1990s, was revealed in 2023. Considering the success Bungie has found with Halo and Destiny, and given their recent acquisition by PlayStation, expectations for Marathon are quite high.</p>



<p>Marathon is already going through the ringer during its development process. In 2024, the game’s director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly fired due to inappropriate conduct</a> towards several female employees. Barrett has denied these claims and has since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie. The last official update regarding the game itself came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this past October</a>, from new game director and former director for VALORANT, Joe Ziegler. Ziegler says there have been some “aggressive” changes to gameplay over the past couple years following several playtests. He also said that different parts of the game are at different stages of development.</p>



<p>Can Bungie’s Marathon live up to the hype? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

As mentioned above, this is a remake of the PS2 game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, which is arguably the best game in the franchise. It's a Cold War-era prequel that explains how Big Boss earned his title and reputation as a legendary soldier, and it includes numerous enhancements. </p>                      </div><p>While the story and setting are the same as the PS2 original, Snake Eater now sports an Unreal Engine 5 makeover and nearly every animation in the game has been completely overhauled. Konami says it only modernized gameplay elements where it made sense to do so, and you can choose to play it with the original control scheme or a modernized version instead.</p><p>This approach extends to an over-the-shoulder third-person viewpoint in New Style and a top-down viewpoint in Legacy Style that Metal Gear Solid purists will appreciate. Another neat quality-of-life upgrade is a quick-select menu to make changing your camouflage simpler.</p><p>Metal Gear Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will also be available for Xbox Series X|S and PS5, and on the Sony platform, you can expect a smooth and enhanced performance if you own a PS5 Pro console.</p><p>For more details on console preorders, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preorder guide</a>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-up-to-20-on-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-for-pc/1100-6529515/">Save Up To $20 On Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Preorders For PC</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Everyone in the gaming world is waiting for GTA 6 with bated breath, and there's one question that many are wondering about: Just what exactly is going to happen to the game we currently know as GTA Online when GTA 6 releases? While we still don't have the answer, in a recent interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick hinted that the current GTA Online could continue after GTA 6 releases as a "legacy title."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Zelnick said that the publisher has a history of "support[ing] our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles." He cites the 2012 example of NBA 2K Online in China, noting that the original game is still online and on the market, even after the release of NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. "...We've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>

<p dir="ltr">Zelnick was quick to clarify that he was speaking "theoretically," and that an announcement will be made in the future. However, this appears to be an important indication as to what Take-Two's future plans might be. GTA Online is a huge moneymaker for Rockstar and Take-Two in general, but it's been widely speculated by many that GTA 6 will bring a new version of GTA Online along with it. It's unclear how exactly this hypothetical new GTA Online would interface with the old GTA Online, particularly when you consider the amount of resources that some players have put into the game. Fans still don't have the clarification they seek, but this might mean they can rest a bit easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We still don't know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/">GTA 6's release date</a>, but Take-Two has said multiple times that it'll release in Fall 2025. Zelnick said in another interview back in late 2024 that Borderlands 4 and GTA 6 will probably not be released close to one another--Borderlands 4 releases on September 23, which might indicate that GTA 6 will come later in the year, assuming it doesn't slip to 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Epic Games Store Year in Review for 2024 is here, and according to Epic, PC gamers spent a pretty impressive amount of money in the store last year, although there could well be a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>Epic says that PC players racked up $1.09 billion in spending on the Store throughout 2024, but that figure is "including Epic's games", so it's likely that the number includes spending for battle royale juggernaut&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>The figure represents a 15% increase on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023" rel="nofollow">last year's</a>, but if the number is restricted to just third-party games, it's much lower; just $255m was spent on third-party PC games in the store in 2024, representing an 18% drop from 2023's total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-fortnite.jpg?itok=t9JYXZb0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-fortnite.jpg?itok=L_Y9J8AM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>PC spending on the Epic Games Store jumped to over $1b in 2024, but that probably includes&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, Epic hit a new high of 295 million total Epic Games Store PC users last year, representing a 25 million increase on a year-over-year basis.</p>

<p>However, the highest monthly active user total on the platform was 74 million, which Epic achieved in December 2024. That represents a drop of 1% over last year's peak figure, although I'm sure Epic won't be losing sleep over that.</p>

<p>Average monthly active users rose by 6%, as did average daily active users, and the total number of hours players spent playing games on the store was 7.72 billion, a rise of 10% over last year's figure.</p>

<p>Epic's free game program also continued throughout 2024, bringing games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">Hell Let Loose</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a>&nbsp;</em>to players for absolutely nothing. All in all, players redeemed almost 600 million free games via the store in 2024.</p>
