		<p>I do feel as though I was born in the wrong era. For all that there was no medicine, that you brushed your teeth with twigs, and pillaging was a daily possibility, the simple, arable life that existed in medieval England still sounds like a lot less pressure than the modern day. Working the fields or raising livestock would be popular choices, but blacksmithing must have been the top pick at medieval careers day. Particularly for the less sporty kids who couldn’t swing a sword.</p>
<p>For all those ideas, Bladesong’s opening is somewhat more high-pressure than I was expecting. You awake on your deathbed. The elderly woman who’s nursing you pours water down your throat, and you find yourself selecting your own backstory, telling her where you’ve come from, what you carry with you, and what drives you to stay alive. Is it ambition, continuity or compassion that you believe in?</p>
<p><iframe title="Bladesong - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVZrvOBVEdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Bladesong’s narrative plays out as an old-school text adventure would, giving you prompts to choose from as you awaken, remembering your past and setting forth on a new beginning. It definitely tickled away at my gaming memory, selecting the option to ‘Get your bearings’ and being told, “You’re in a tent. There’s no sign of your caretaker, apart from a half-empty water pail and a damp cloth on your brow.” This is absolutely what games were like when I first discovered them, and that literary edge is put to good use in Bladesong’s opening, forming a clear vision of its fantasy medieval world and your place within it.</p>
<p>You are a blacksmith. A half-dead one, but a blacksmith, nonetheless. Each day, you’re offered a selection of commissions, and you’re able to choose which of these you take on, with new ones coming in the next morning. Each commission uses up resources, including Action Points, Steel, Leather and Wood, depending on the task set out in front of you. Alongside the cost, commissions also make specific requests about the type of blade you forge, and you have to try to make something that matches their specification.</p>


<p>The first customer that approaches you wants a sword that’s two-handed, asking for something, “Good and long. I don’t like my enemies to be in hugging distance.” There’s no other requirements here, but later commissions might ask for a sword that hits hard, or one that’s viciously sharp. You then select abilities to start shaping the blade.</p>
<p>You start each sword with a billet, a chunk of steel, that you then have to physically hammer and mould into shape. You select the right ability, and then hammer away with repeated clicks of the mouse to bash it into the correct form, with clicks at the top of the hammer’s apex resulting in harder blows. One after another, you hammer out the length, then flatten it to the right thickness and width, before shaping the end into a point and working on the blade’s cross section.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the blade into the correct shape, you need to add a hilt, a grip and a pommel, because, well, a sword without those things looks silly. That, and it’s much harder to hold. There’s various options within each of these additions, so you can tailor your wickedly sharp creations to both the owner and your own tastes as well.</p>
<p>Each commission has its own narrative context, and you begin to build a picture of this mud-strewn, dangerous place that you start the game in. As a new blacksmith, you slowly build up your position within the encampment, attempting to make your way into the city beyond, though your business model may cause the odd moral quandary when your customers are definitely going to shove your creations into another person’s gut.</p>
<p>Each time you complete a commission, you earn a portion of XP, and as with all good RPGs, once you’ve got enough you’ll level up. This then grants you skill points, which you can plough into the smithing skill tree, giving you access to advanced smithing, the ability to engrave your creations, or even start to work with curved blades. You can see all of these options from the off, so if there’s a particular creation you have in mind, you can choose to work your way along that branch before testing the others.</p>

<p>If you want to see the kind of things you’ll eventually be able to create, the Creative mode immediately gives you every single one of Bladesong’s tools and attachments to play with. There’s three pre-built examples for you to lovingly spin around in 3D which you can dismantle as well, swapping out parts and making changes as you see fit, before embarking on your own design project. If you attempt this at an early point in the Campaign’s narrative there’s a daunting array of options, but as you become more proficient, you’ll soon learn how to construct your perfect sword. The UI mostly does a good job of supporting you in that effort, though there’s a few rough edges to polish up through Early Access, like being able to easily apply different materials to your blade.</p>
<p>The painterly artwork for each location really helps set the scene, and they shift in front of you ever so slightly to make it feel as though you’re actually looking at them. It’s surprisingly effective, and a clever way for a smaller team to manifest a bigger, living world. The swordmaking display is similarly straightforward: an anvil, hammer and blade existing within a black void. I’d love to see this develop through Early Access into specific places, viewing your commissions in situ within your tent, or possibly founding your own smithy as you progress, but it definitely works well as it is.</p>
<p>ughij</p>
<p>There’s something very compelling at work in Bladesong. The sense of desperation, danger and destitution run through the opening hours of the Campaign with alarming force, and in some ways the smithing and swordmaking is simply the means to explore and experience more of this world. I love the writing, and the classic adventure threads that run through each moment really help to pull you onwards.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s the smithing sections that let you truly embody a medieval craftsman, and Bladesong gives you the physical and narrative tools to decide exactly who that craftsman is. You learn to balance your own creativity with what your customers want, and as you become more proficient with a hammer, you forge your own place in Bladesong’s world. It makes for a unique, thoughtful and utterly engaging experience that’s bound to find a legion of fans.</p>

<p>Rosalina Returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-has-been-rated">rating</a> earlier this month, Nintendo has today given us another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a>, accompanied by a release date of <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases a bunch of new features that will be arriving in the 2023 platformer. First up is the Game Room Plaza, a location for some multiplayer mayhem which will offer six different 'attraction' minigames to be played either locally or online with up to 12 people.</p>
<p>The Toad Brigade occupy a new area called 'Camp Central', where you can participate in training challenges to hone your skills, earn patches, and raise your Brigade ranking.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us another look at the Koopalings! These notorious baddies have stolen the Bellabel Flowers and scattered them across the map, so add that to the list of collectables as you make your way across the levels.</p>
<p>And speaking of familiar faces, Rosalina is available as a playable character in this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition! You can even control a Luma as a 'co-star' in co-op, where Mouse Mode is an option.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the trailer wraps up with the big reveal that three (yes, <em>three</em>) Wonder amiibo will be launching alongside the Switch 2 Edition on 26th March — Prince Florian fans, rise up!</p>

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.

            <title><![CDATA[Big games are getting bigger — and so are the stakes]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/865219/ubisoft-reorganization-ea-playstation-big-games</link>
            <guid>1413049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ubisoft is making some massive changes to its business: As part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/865060/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-reorganization">a reorganization</a>, the company will focus its efforts on the big open-world games it’s famous for along with live service titles, and it has canceled six in-development games, including <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em>. It’s all part of a recent trend of the industry’s biggest publishers, including companies like EA and Sony, making fewer but bigger games to avoid risk.</p><p>Under its new structure, Ubisoft games will be developed by five “Creative Houses” focused on specific genres and franchises. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789721/ubisoft-vantage-studios-subsidiary-assassins-creed-far-cry">previously announced Vantage Studios</a>, for example, will develop Ubisoft’s biggest franchises to “turn them into annual billionaire brands,” including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>. Other Ubisoft studios are focused on competitive shooters, live service games, fantasy and narrative-driven “universes,” and casual games.</p><div><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy”</p></div><p>Ubisoft’s press release lists a lot of familiar series that will live under these studios, including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, <em>Just Dance</em>, and <em>Prince of Persia</em>, despite the <em>Sands of Time</em> cancellation. Even <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, the sequel to which has been in development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">well over a decade</a>, is included. But Ubisoft says that there are just four franchises that are actually new in development — and that it canceled three franchises in the works — indicating it plans to rely more on familiar brands instead of branching out. In addition to canceling games, the new structure has also meant the closure of several studios and will likely <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r">lead to more layoffs</a> in the future.</p><p>This structure puts more pressure on these games to be successful, as shown by the catastrophic failure of PlayStation’s <em>Concord</em>. That game, which was in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">about eight years</a>, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">reportedly expensive to make</a> and didn’t catch on right away. As a result, Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">took the game offline</a> just two weeks after it launched, and a few weeks later, it permanently shut down the game and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">developer Firewalk Studios</a>. Ubisoft obviously wants to avoid those kinds of fiascos, and by banking on known games and franchises, it reduces the risk of a bomb. And games that probably won’t be a smash hit, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667061/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-remake-release-date-by-april-2026">years-in-development <em>Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, seem like they won’t be a major part of the strategy moving forward.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy,” Joost van Dreunen, a New York University games professor who also <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">writes about the industry</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “When markets get choppy, large publishers retreat to what they know works: their established franchises. It’s a rational response to uncertainty, but it comes with real costs,” he adds, like recycling proven franchises instead of developing new experiences and potentially raising prices to justify big-budget sequels. “This strategy might work for publishers with deep catalogs of beloved franchises, but it’s not a guarantee of survival,” van Dreunen says. “It’s more like buying time than building a sustainable future.”</p><p>Ubisoft’s shift is similar to what we’ve seen from other big gaming companies. EA, even before the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">$55 billion deal</a> to take the company private, had been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">focusing more</a> on tentpole franchises with big online communities, like <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and <em>The Sims</em>. After <em>Battlefield 2042’</em>s rocky launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">a pivotal moment for the series and EA</a>, and it was also a huge undertaking, developed by multiple internal studios. That bet seems to have paid off as the game has been a massive hit, with EA proclaiming it to be “the best selling shooter game” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">of 2025</a>. Like Ubisoft, EA has smaller franchises, like <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, but it has also whittled down its library, canceling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">a <em>Black Panther</em> game in development</a>.</p><p>Sony is similarly focusing its efforts into fewer games that largely fall in two distinct groups. While Sony has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">scaled back</a> its live service ambitions and weathered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">some failures</a>, live service games are still a key pillar for the company — it even announced a new studio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662579/team-lfg-playstation-studio">last year</a> that’s spun out of <em>Destiny</em> maker Bungie. Meanwhile, Sony is also continuing to push the big-budget single-player exclusives that have become so closely associated with the PlayStation brand. Its known projects in the works include expansive single-player games that build upon what their developers did before: Housemarque’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843302/housemarques-next-game-is-getting-a-small-delay"><em>Saros</em></a> follows up the well-received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"><em>Returnal</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em></a> is the next game from <em>Spider-Man</em> maker Insomniac, and <em>The Last of Us</em> developer Naughty Dog is hard at work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p><p>In Wednesday’s press release, Ubisoft cofounder and CEO Yves Guillemot summarized the problem the AAA market is facing: It’s more competitive, has higher costs, and has greater challenges, but successful games have “more financial potential than ever.” The company, like many others, is making the bet that refocusing on bigger and known brands that are released on a more regular cadence will be a more stable business. That path may prove successful, but it’s also one saddled with issues, from lost jobs to less creative innovation. The future of blockbuster games is unclear, but it will be full of familiar faces. Get ready for even more <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/865219/ubisoft-reorganization-ea-playstation-big-games]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[UGREEN’s 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock Is Now the Cheapest Way to Upgrade Your Handheld Setup After a Deep Discount (Works With ROG Ally X, Legion Go, MacBoo]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-is-now-the-cheapest-way-to-upgrade-your-handheld-setup-after-a-deep-discount-works-with-rog-ally-x-legion-go-macbook-and-more-2000661995</link>
            <guid>1413037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you use a Steam Deck or another handheld PC for games or work, and want to switch to a bigger screen for a more immersive experience, a dedicated dock can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">Right now, the 6-in-1 Ugreen Steam Deck dock is on sale at Amazon for $30, down from its usual (and already affordable) $46 price</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on an option that packs a punch and offers solid compatibility across a range of devices. Shipping will be free for Prime users, so they’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comes With a Foldable Stand</h2>
<p>The dock supports HDMI 2.1 output with up to 4K@120Hz, plus VRR, FreeSync, and G-Sync. It’s made to deliver an incredibly smooth and immersive gaming or movie playback experience without screen tearing or noticeable lag. You’ll enjoy sharp, vibrant visuals on compatible displays for all your favorite titles.</p>
<p>There’s 100W PD 3.0 fast charging support, too. The Steam Deck dock delivers up to 85W to your host device, while also powering itself, which means you can keep the connected device charged and running without relying on an external power solution. This is also great for ensuring the secondary device doesn’t run out of power in the middle of an important session with friends.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re getting two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C data port, Gigabit Ethernet, and the HDMI output. These are more than enough to connect a bunch of peripherals, from controllers to keyboards and external storage solutions, without feeling limited. The thing plays nicely with gaming handhelds like Steam Deck, ROG Ally, ROG Xbox Ally, ROG Xbox Ally X, Region Go, and is also fully compatible with laptops, PCs, Macs, and phones.</p>
<p>Getting started couldn’t be easier. The dock offers a simple plug-and-play setup across Windows, macOS, Linux, and SteamOS, meaning there’s no need to worry about installing drivers or following complicated setup processes. Connect it to your device, and you’re good to go in no time. Just note that the dock is mainly designed for PC-based setups, so it is not compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Additionally, the built-in foldable stand holds your handheld safely in place as you teach the bad guys a lesson. It’s made out of aluminum alloy and PC+ABS, so it’s sturdy for both daily use and occasional travel.</p>
<p>You can now enjoy all these features and a lot more for just $30, which is basically nothing considering the convenience this dock brings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">The 35% discount is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon.</a> If you’ve been looking for a way to play your favorite titles better, now is the time to make the move.</p>

              <p><span>People who play gacha games sometimes tell me they’ve spent thousands of dollars in them over the course of years of playing, but in those situations at least they’re doing so on purpose and with full knowledge of their actions. </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span> players, however, were charged thousands of dollars for mundane microtransactions due to a Paypal glitch, prompting developer Hypergryph to take the option to make purchases through the service offline. Not a great start to the game’s launch today.</span></p>   <p><span>Players reported (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arknights-endfield-paypal-launch-issues/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>) multiple odd Paypal charges from the game in various currencies and amounts within hours of </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>’s launch, ranging anywhere from a few dollars up to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjj50k/comment/o0zecyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the equivalent of $3,300 USD</span></a><span>. The glitch seemed to </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultCooperativeAntDuDudu-5OOgZdEZo-lg2RNm"><span>charge players for other users’ purchases</span></a><span> if their Paypal account was linked to the game, hence why some players saw charges in different currencies from around the world, rather than solely in their own domestic currency.</span></p>

 <p><span>Developer Hypergryph was made aware of the issue and has since </span><a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888?s=20"><span>taken the game’s Paypal compatibility offline</span></a><span>, and recommends players use any other means of purchasing microtransactions for the time being.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have received reports that the PayPal payment channel is currently undergoing temporary maintenance and upgrades.</span></p> <p><span>All affected Endministrators are advised to use other available payment channels.</span></p> <p><span>Transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deduction will be handled accordingly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, it couldn’t possibly get any worse for launch day, right? God willing. Hopefully those four-figure charges weren’t too widespread. Hypergryph says it will be handling all these erroneous transactions, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the company also gave out some in-game currency or rewards as an apology. If you’re playing </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>, keep an eye out for any odd transactions for a bit in case this affects other payment options as well.</span></p>

            <p>Hypixel Studios has detailed the second patch for its Minecraft-like Hytale.</p>
<p>The forthcoming update covers a range of areas, including cosmetics and customisation, world generation, farming, audio and more. Rather excitingly, there is also new magic, the developer has proclaimed, along with a Necromancy grimoire.</p>
<p>For those with an aversion to snakes a la Indiana Jones (why is it always, snakes?), the studio is also going to implement an ophidiophobia accessibility mode.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-amd-ryzen-9-cpu-at-its-lowest-price-after-a-sudden-discount-16-core-32-thread-processor-2000661946</link>
            <guid>1412983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC hardware deals don’t always line up this cleanly, but this one is hard to ignore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">Amazon has dropped the price of AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X by 20%, knocking it down to $519 from its original $649 launch price.</a> For anyone planning a new gaming PC or looking to anchor a high-end upgrade, this discount puts one of AMD’s most powerful consumer CPUs firmly within reach.</p>
<p>Building a PC might look intimidating at first glance, but the real challenge usually comes long before a screwdriver ever touches a case. Sorting through spec sheets, comparing model numbers, and figuring out what actually delivers value can feel overwhelming. CPUs in particular tend to blur together when clock speeds, core counts, and generation labels start stacking up. Finding a processor that’s got power and long-term relevance that doesn’t break the bank is key. So please direct your attention to the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="870" data-end="911">A Flagship CPU Built for Modern Gaming</h2>
<p>Only a little more than a year old, the Ryzen 9 9950X sits at the top of AMD’s consumer lineup. With 16 cores and 32 threads. It’s designed to handle far more than today’s games alone. Paired with a strong GPU, this processor can comfortably drive high refresh rate gaming, including demanding titles running at ultra settings. High-resolution streaming, background apps, and content creation tasks won’t slow it down either.</p>
<p>Clocked at a base speed of 4.3 GHz, the Ryzen 9 9950X delivers excellent performance right out of the box. Anyone who like to squeeze out extra power will appreciate that the chip is fully unlocked for overclocking, with boost speeds reaching up to 5.7 GHz under the right conditions. That extra headroom can make a noticeable difference for video encoding, 3D rendering, and competitive gaming scenarios where every frame counts.</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software adds another layer of control. The utility provides real-time monitoring of temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, and memory timings, all from a clean interface. Custom profiles make it easy to switch between performance-focused settings and quieter, power-efficient configurations depending on the task. Keep in mind that the Ryzen 9 9950X does not ship with a stock cooler, and AMD recommends pairing it with a quality liquid cooling solution to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">At $519, the Ryzen 9 9950X is a serious investment, but also a smart one</a>. CPUs of this caliber tend to age gracefully, staying relevant for years as games and software continue to evolve. This is the kind of processor that can serve as the backbone of a system well into the next generation of PC gaming. With the current Amazon discount in play, now is an excellent moment to lock in elite performance at a much more approachable price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Now the Most Awarded Game of All Time, Surpassing Elden Ring Thanks to Wccftech GOTY]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/</link>
            <guid>1412965</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has broken a new record, <strong>surpassing FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> when it comes to <strong>overall Game of the Year wins</strong> from press outlets and industry associations. <strong>It did so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our own Wccftech Awards '25 prizes</a></strong>, awarded by staff and community both after extensive polls.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ResetEra user Angie, who keeps a detailed record of all the Game of the Year wins for each year, revealed how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had quickly dethroned <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong> at the third spot. Now, shortly after our announcement of the Wccftech Awards '25 winners, the ResetEra thread <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-now-the-most-awarded-game-of-the-year-ever.1411252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was updated</a> with Angie claiming that our GOTY awards were just enough to surpass Elden Ring's previous record of <strong>435 GOTY prizes</strong> in a single award season. </p>



<p>Sandfall's game now <strong>sits alone at 436</strong>, and the award season is far from over. The game is extremely well-positioned to win again at upcoming events like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DICE Awards</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>. The winners of the former will be announced by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</strong> (AIAS) on Thursday, February 12, 2026, during the <strong>DICE 2026 Summit</strong> in Las Vegas. We'll have to wait a bit more to know the winners of the latter, as the GDC Awards will be unveiled on Thursday, March 12, 2026, during the <strong>Game Developers Conference 2026</strong> in San Francisco. A bit further still, the <strong>BAFTA Game Awards 2026</strong> winners will be announced on Friday, April 17, 2026, in London.</p>



<p>Those are the major ones, but there are a few others. It's not inconceivable for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to reach <strong>450 Game of the Year wins</strong> or more, which would make the record quite hard to beat in the coming years. Records aside, what's more important is that <strong>Sandfall Interactive has earned the industry's unanimous appreciation</strong>, from professionals to fans. <span>Just a few days ago, a veteran developer like&nbsp;<strong>The Astronauts</strong>' founder and director,&nbsp;<strong>Adrian Chmielarz,</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated</a> that the game's incredible quality, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved with a relatively low budget</a> and a small development team, made him question everything he thought he knew about the limits of game de</span>velopment.</p>



<p>Of course, now Sandfall Interactive has everyone's eyes on them. Will they be able to stay humble and handle the inevitable massive hype surrounding their next project? Only time will tell, but we're certainly rooting for them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-optimized-microsd-card-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-at-under-0-16-per-gb-2000661937</link>
            <guid>1412962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>

<p>The <strong>ver. 2.6.0</strong> update arrived late last night here in the UK, and it seems that the main focus was on making things that little bit nicer to play. At least, we think that was the focus. As is so often the case with small Nintendo updates, the patch notes for this one are rather vague.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kmvwoj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Tetris 99 ver. 2.6.0 (Released 21st Jan 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong><br>
- Adjustments have been made to make the game more comfortable to play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, that's it. Now, as outlined above by @Oatmealdome over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3mcyhsxud4c2l">Bluesky</a>, select Tetris 99 updates in the past have been all about moving event themes from the game server into the files, and there's every chance something similar has happened here — the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tetris-99s-first-maximus-cup-of-2026-celebrates-animal-crossing-unlock-a-special-theme">Maximus Cup</a> wrapped up just two weeks ago, let's not forget.</p>
<p>Either way, make sure you've updated your game if you're after some bonus comfort.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch has arrived ahead of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">slightly delayed Redacted Regiment warbond</a> also making its sneaky debut today, January 22nd. In line with that warbond's stealthy shushness, this patch has seen Arrowhead add in new commando missions designed to reward those who know when to crouch-walk. They've also revealed that the slim build that's been in beta for a little while is finally ready to take the reigns from the standard version and its very chunky install size.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731129453?l=english">patch notes</a> describe the new commando missions as follows: "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> are going deep behind enemy lines where their normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option. Reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time." As such, knowing when to kill quietly or co-ordinate a rush with other players will be key.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to test out some tuning up of suppressed guns, which should now be "more valuable in stealth gameplay and attract less attention from enemies", as a result of firing noise radius tweaks. As part of that, foes like the devastator, berserker, spewer, charger, impaler, and observer have been made a bit more chill about bullets landing vaguely in their vicinity, so non-hits are less likely to instantly draw their ire.</p>
<p>Outside of the sneaky stuff, the slim build of Helldivers 2 which Arrowhead have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">beta testing as part of efforts to cut the 154GB game down to just 23GB</a> in terms of install size will no longer be in beta at some point soon.</p><p>"We are ready to make the slim PC build default for all players," The studio wrote. "We’ll keep the larger version online for a short time to ensure a smooth transition for everyone; so you’ll continue to have the option to switch back should you wish. Once this transition has been completed we’ll look to sunset the large build permanently in the near future." As of writing, no exact date for the initial switch appears to have been given, but it sounds like it'll be ASAP.</p>
<p>Rounding out this first drop of new Helldivers 2 stuff for 2026 was a promise that there's "much more to come in February and beyond", as you'd hope. For now, in the spirit of these sneaky missions, Arrowhead aren't giving too much away.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s efforts to break ground while Gittin’ Back To When Battlefield Was Gud continue with the announcement of two forthcoming maps in the EA shooter’s second season, which begins 17th February. One of the maps is Contaminated, a brand new field of battle that is comparable in scale to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>’s St Quentin Scar and Arras in Battlefield 5. The other is a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>’s Golmud Railway – a big, grassy vehicular affair, based on China’s actually existing Golmud-Lhasa railway line.
</p>
<p>
“In this next session, we’ll be testing content on one of Season 2’s new maps: Contaminated,” explains <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">an EA social post</a>. “We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries. We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.
</p>

“While we’re saving full details on the new map for a later time,” it continues, “we can share that in terms of size, Contaminated falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley, and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar (Battlefield 1) or Arras (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>).”
</p>
<p>
As for Golmud Railway, EA’s goal is “to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems”. It’ll be the biggest Battlefield 6 map ever. EA will release it first in Battlefield Labs so that they can “test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time”.
</p><p>
Speaking of those wily airplanes, the devs are also testing out changes to vehicle handling in the run-up to Season 2. This includes tweaks to the AH-6 Little Bird, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD_Helicopters_MH-6_Little_Bird">Killer Egg</a>, which looks much like how an egg might look if you mounted cannons on it and parked a bunch of screaming jarheads on each side. The fan favourite chopper appears in the game's singleplayer, and can be spawned in Battlefield Portal, but is not formally part of BF6 multiplayer right now. The devs are considering “how it fits within the broader vehicle ecosystem and how it performs across different combat scenarios”.
</p>
<p>
They’re also doing some initial testing on “Aircraft Radar, an important part of the aircraft gameplay experience and a system we’re actively evaluating as part of future air combat improvements”. As I understand it, this is a feature that extends your radar range so you can better track aircraft, which tend to be pretty fast. Unless I’m piloting them, in which case they tend to explode on the runway.
</p>
<p>
“In parallel, we’ll be exploring a tuning package focused on rocket and vehicle interactions, including early adjustments to weapons such as RPGs and TOW launchers, as well as vehicle handling considerations when countering rockets,” the devs continue. There’s some talk of testing improvements “to hit registration and overall combat consistency”, to avoid “scenarios where players may be eliminated after reaching cover, often referred to as ‘death behind cover’ or desync-related behavior.”
</p>
<p>
Last and maybe, possibly not least, the devs are doing more testing around solo play in the battle royale mode. They want to understand “where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences”. They note that there will never be a “single permanent configuration” for the game’s Plunkbat equivalent. It shall shift and alter like wind through the grasses of Golmund Railway when some absolute plonker crashlands a Killer Egg on take-off.

              <p>Today’s annual Xbox Developer Direct goes live today at 1 p.m ET, during which the focus is expected to fall heavily on Playground Studios, developers of both <em>Fable</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. Both are confirmed to be appearing at the show, alongside Game Freak’s non-<em>Pokémon</em> RPG&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">as&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>, it seems we now doubly know for sure one of the show’s intended surprises: <em>Forza Horizon</em>‘s release date. However, if any other games are to appear, Microsoft has achieved the unlikely and managed to keep it all under wraps.</p> <p>This isn’t the first time the May 19 release date for <em>FH6</em> has got out into the wild, although a second source certainly makes it seem all the more likely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807">Last week a Saudi X account claimed to have seen an accidentally released trailer</a> for the Japan-set racing game which featured the release date of May 19. <em>Eurogamer</em> now adds that renowned leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">billbil-kun has authenticated the date</a>, alongside the blatantly obvious news that the game will release in Standard, Deluxe and Premium forms. Despite only being a few months away, we’ve seen almost nothing of the game beyond <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658">a tease of Japanese mountains</a> and other culturally iconic artifacts. Microsoft is promising a “deep-dive” during the Direct, which will include “new features.”</p>

 <p>Microsoft also says the Developer Direct livestream will include a “first extended look at <em>Fable</em>,” the relaunching of the action-RPG franchise formerly developed by Lionhead Studios. Despite seemingly having been in some sort of development since perhaps as early as 2017, this will be the first time anything of depth will have been shown, following <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-4-reboot-gameplay-trailer-xbox-summer-game-fest-1849051021">2023’s somewhat obfuscatory trailer</a> featuring Richard Ayoade. No word has leaked about whether we’ll be seeing a release date for the oft-slipping game.</p> <p>The final announced game is quite the coup for Microsoft (and Sony, it should be said), getting a Game Freak title away from Nintendo for the first time since 2017’s, er, <em>Giga Wrecker</em>. (No, me neither.) That eventually saw a Switch release, meaning the last time the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> developer made a game that didn’t see a Nintendo version was 2015’s&nbsp;<em>Tempo the Badass Elephant</em>, and I think we can all agree: what? Before those two you have to go back to the 1990s. Anyway, action-RPG <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is due to come to PC, Xbox and PS5 (and&nbsp;<em>not</em> Switch) at some point in 2026, and today’s show will reveal “details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>

 <p>That’s all that’s confirmed, but I bet my right buttock that a fourth game will be snuck in there, even if it’s just a teasing glimpse (which you will <em>not</em> be getting of my right buttock.)</p> <p>You can catch the entire thing at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) via Xbox’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXn6bvU1Kh4">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> channels, or just stare at the embed below for the next few hours.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-drone-combo-with-4k-camera-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000661980</link>
            <guid>1412920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“The Drone Ban” sounds overly alarmist, but it’s real. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has instituted a ban on new foreign-made drones and drone components. Which, considering the huge market dominance of Chinese brands, translates into a “buy them now while you can” situation for hobbyist drones. While this ban prevents any new models from being imported and sold in the U.S., ones that are already here are still available for purchase and use.</p>
<p>DJI is the undisputed U.S. market leader for drone hobbyists, and they’re a Chinese company that’s subject to the new FCC ban. Thankfully this doesn’t affect current DJI products already in the country, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Amazon’s number-one-selling hobbyist drone — the DJI Mini 4K — is available and at its lowest price in 30 days after a 21% price drop down to $309.</a> There won’t be any upgraded versions of the Mini coming, so it’s wise to grab this one while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Beginner-Friendly Bundle</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K Combo that’s on sale at Amazon is comprised of the top-selling, beginner-friendly Mini 4K, its remote controller, two DJI Mini 2 Intelligent Flight rechargeable batteries, a propeller holder, and shoulder bag. The two batteries combine for over an hour of flight time, more than enough to use the Mini 4K’s UHD camera to take incredible aerial still photos and 4K videos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Mini 4K is exceptionally beginner-friendly — easy to learn, easy to operate, and built with failsafe features like GPS Return to Home, which automatically brings it back to its point of origin if the signal is dropped or you just feel like you’re losing control of the drone. Most of the commands are one-touch, including takeoff and a soft landing that prevents crashes. The DJI Fly app (available for download at the official DJI website) is packed with learning resources that will have you sending the Mini 4K up to 4,000 meters high, with video transmission of up to 10 km for long-range flight and photography.</p>



<h2>Tiny and Tough</h2>
<p>The Mini 4K weighs just over 8 ounces, and the four propeller arms fold back into the main body to reduce it to a neat palm-sized package. Even with such a small and lightweight body, the Mini 4K’s four brushless motors are powerful enough to battle winds of up to 23 mph while in flight, a vast improvement over earlier hobbyist drones.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the Drone Ban will be lifted and new advanced models from DJI and other foreign manufacturers will again be allowed into the U.S.? Of course — nothing is less predictable than what comes out of Washington. But there’s an equal or better chance that the ban will stick, and it could take years for U.S. manufacturers to catch up to where DJI is now. Bottom line: The last legal foreign-made hobbyist drones are on our shores now, and the DJI Mini 4K is among the very best for beginners and more advanced flyers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Take this Amazon limited-time deal and score yourself a terrific entry-level drone bundle for just $309.</a></p>

<p>Episode 7 is the upcoming continuation of Amazon’s Fallout Season 2. The smash-hit adaptation is currently on pace to outshine and dethrone S1 as the superior series, so make sure you don’t miss Fallout Season 2 Episode 7, with this release date and start time hub.</p>



<p>Video game adaptations are hit or miss. The Last of Us Season 1 is a masterpiece, whereas Halo bombed. Arcane is sensational, but Return to Silent Hill is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. Fallout has been a revelation, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2</a> continues to deliver for Amazon and fans.</p>



<p>If you’re looking forward to the follow-up to Episode 6’s ‘The Other Player,’ here’s the latest Episode 7 info.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-7-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a blast. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 will release on January 28, carrying on Season 2’s regular weekly release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Episode 6 was released on January 21, so Episode 7 is coming on January 28. Shows on Amazon and Netflix are very consistent with episode release patterns, and Episode 7 should be no different.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming will be on the ball and the first to update you if any Radroaches or Deathclaws decide you need to take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apply-for-fallout-shelter-reality-show-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(Fallout) shelter</a> for another week.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-7-start-times-amp-date">Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Start Times &amp; Date</h2>



<p><strong>Pacific Time-based viewers can start watching Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 from midnight on January 21, and it will be available later for everyone else around the world.</strong></p>



<p>While it would be good if the sun could somehow light up the planet in the same way worldwide, we have to settle for time zones, regions, and scattered releases.</p>



<p>Check out if your region is listed below and what time you can start watching Episode 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will soon get the Techmarine, its seventh playable class, and with it comes a unique ability that sounds very exciting indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Space Marine 2 game director Dmitry Grigorenko revealed that the Techmarine is designed to be a crowd control and area defense specialist, leaning on tech to get the job done, as they do in the Warhammer 40,000 lore and tabletop wargame upon which Space Marine 2 is based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In melee the Techmarine uses the Omnissian Axe for wide swipes. This is an upcoming weapon only the Techmarine will have access to upon launch. He also has mechanical arms and an automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Techmarine Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that while you’re actively fighting, you can use the Techmarine’s Combat Skill (Space Marine 2’s version of an ‘ultimate’ ability) to trigger the mounted Servo-Gun, which will lay down heavy fire without the player needing to aim it. “Just watch as Tyranids and Thousand Sons get vaporized before your very eyes,” Grigorenko teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the super interesting part: the automatic Servo-Gun frees you up by executing Gun Strikes for you. This is a big deal indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, in Space Marine 2, a Gun Strike is a powerful, quick pistol shot you perform after a perfect dodge or parry (or a heavy attack that stuns smaller foes) when a red reticle appears on an enemy, dealing significant damage and allowing for powerful follow-ups without needing to aim or use ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All other classes must manually do a Gun Strike for themselves. But Techmarine players, as Grigorenko put it, “will be free to continue aiming at other targets while their turrets stagger or kill their most pressing assailants.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Already fans are getting excited about this new ability, even though it’s limited to your Combat Skill (at least, that’s how the Xbox Wire blog post makes it sound). “Jesus Christ, I was already excited for this class, it just keeps on getting better,” said one fan. “I hope there’s a Techmarine perk or weapon perk that’ll help give more Gun Strikes to really take advantage of that.” Said another person who clearly knows their Warhammer 40,000 lore: “Get your blessing brothers, awake the machine spirit, refined the holy oil and praise the Motive Force, this new class looks dope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even more to the Techmarine. It also has the unique ability to locate and service Tarantula Sentry turrets during missions. “Though they can’t be carried or placed freely, these can provide much welcome support to your Combat Squad by attacking your enemies automatically until they either run out of ammunition or get destroyed,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine hits Space Marine 2 as part of Patch 12, due out in a few weeks. The new class will be available across all modes apart from the narrative campaign, as it centers around the story of Ultramarines Lieutenant Demetrian Titus.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming with Patch 12 is a 12th mission to the Operations and Stratagems modes, a new mission pick-up type, three new Hero weapon variants, and new customization options for Space Marine helmetless heads. If you own the Season Pass 2 you also get a brand-new Assault Champion Raven Guard skin and a unique cosmetic pack for the Carcharodons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As announced this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-close-out-january-2026-with-a-bolt-from-the-grim-darkness-of-the-far-future-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2 releases on Xbox Game Pass, with Xbox Play Anywhere support, on January 29</a>, so expect an influx of new players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But it's for his work with Retro Studios on the Metroid Prime series for which he's best known.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Dream</a> magazine, Tanabe has said that Metroid Prime 4 was his final game for Nintendo — meaning that he has left the series' story unfinished, and the fate of his villain Sylux uncertain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sylux has been built up as the next Big Bad of the Metroid Prime series, following his introduction in Metroid Prime: Hunters, and the end of the original Metroid Prime trilogy that pitted Samus against Dark Samus. During the interview, Tanabe said he saw Sylux as a way to "further expand the 'Metroid Prime Universe'" and create further games beyond the initial trilogy. Because of this, he implored developers to foreshadow Sylux's presence via cameos in Metroid Prime 3 and Metroid Prime: Federation Force, while keeping his full story under-wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A long time passed before I finally had the opportunity to make this game," Tanabe said of Metroid Prime 4 (via machine translation). "Considering my age, I felt that making this Metroid Prime series might be my last chance. Therefore, I conceived and planned this project as the 'first installment of the Sylux Saga.'</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I portrayed Sylux as a villain with a dark personality, deep resentment, and despicable methods; and from this game onward, Samus will realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable, and he must be completely defeated. Therefore, the final battle between Sylux and Samus is not yet over. However, it took longer than I had imagined to complete this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be able to participate in the production of the series," Tanabe concluded. "Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, [assistant producer Risa] Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is yet to comment on the report, or announce Tanabe's departure. IGN has asked the company for more detail today.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy delay, Metroid Prime 4 finally launched for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 last month, albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no official announcement on how well the game has sold. However, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">an unnamed Nintendo source</a> blamed the recent slowdown in Switch 2 sales over the holiday period on a "complicated" economic climate and the "absence of a major Western game" — despite the launch of Metroid Prime 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo," Tanabe reflected. "Metroid Prime 4 will be the last game I work on at Nintendo. However, we didn't deliberately do anything 'special.' Instead, like all previous Nintendo titles, we worked together with Retro Studios to create it, hoping to bring a fun and unique experience to players of all ages and types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it becomes a game that leaves a lasting impression on players who have played it, I will be very gratified. And for those who haven't played it yet, I hope you will experience the unknown planet Viewros through Samus' eyes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
