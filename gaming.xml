		<p>Any conversation about the best indie developers must include Capybara Games. With a catalogue that stems from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/might-magic-clash-of-heroes">Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes</a>, through Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, to Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked, they consistently turn out the kind of games that stay with you long after you’ve finished playing. Battle Vision Network is set to be their latest, continuing in the vein of previous puzzle-infused games like Clash of Heroes, Critter Crunch, and Grindstone, and just like everything that’s gone before, it looks like it’s going to sink its way into your synapses and have you playing out moves while you’re trying to drift off to sleep.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battle Vision Network – Official Trailer | Capybara Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lr18stnLCrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is a tactical puzzle Roguelike battler, with teams competing in an intergalactic contest for glory. Dan Vader, Capy’s Creative Director tells us, “A Roguelike run of the game is framed as a season of this sport, and of this spectacle that is the BVN show.” He continues, “At the start of the game there’s only one team available, but as you progress you unlock more teams and more captains, each with their own playstyle and abilities.”</p>


<p>You can see that play out in the gameplay trailer, where a piece of toast shaped like a cowboy faces off against a skeleton in a rainbow cape – that’s Texas Toast vs. Rainbow Sparkle, obviously. It’s not just extremely bright and vibrant, but there’s the same sense of humour and quirky art direction that made Grindstone so memorable.</p>
<p>Dan tells us that Battle Vision Network is a spiritual successor to Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, and anyone who’s played that classic title will be able to see the same gameplay threads running through BVN, with two teams made up of different units facing off in turn-based combat.</p>


<p>Different units have unique abilities and uses, such as Todd Thumb. This little finger fella can be stacked into a row of three, which sends a large thumb-based attack straight at the opposition. As you progress through a run, you draft more and more units into your team, until you’ve got a full roster, with a host of different abilities that will give you a variety of tactical options to choose from.</p>
<p>As you complete rounds, you’ll earn Bucks, which you can spend on upgrades for your team, or to upgrade specific units. You’ll also gain a Penant Flag through each round, choosing between three enhancements for your team, and leaning into that Roguelike structure and the random factor that can turn a mediocre run into a mammoth success.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network began life as a mobile-first, PvP, season-based concept, and Capybara were originally working with Netflix to bring it to their mobile game library. However, in 2024, it became clear that Battle Vision Network wasn’t fitting into Netflix’s overarching plan, and Capy were thankfully able to reassess and rework the game, altering how players progress, shifting the focus to a single-player campaign, more like Grindstone and Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes.</p>

<p>Dan honed in on some of the key changes when coming from a mobile title, saying, “OK, we’re going to make a PC widescreen game, and we know that kind of audience soaks up complexity and depth, and experimentation and optimisation, and we can lean into that. And for us, we’re getting older, I have a family, I have a very demanding job, I don’t get to play as many 100-hour RPGs as I used to, so it’s emerged over the years that I really love run-based games, because they’re bite-sized. I can pick them up, I can play a little bit, have a little run, or pause a run, and I don’t feel that I haven’t made a dent in the game. So, we were really enthusiastic to explore our mechanics in that format that we were loving, anyway.”</p>
<p>One of the main differences over Clash of Heroes is that your Captain isn’t just an icon in the corner of the screen, they’re a physical unit with their own abilities, effects and place on the board. They can make the difference between failure and success, but you’ll need to know when and how to utilise them to maximise their impact.</p>

<p>Beyond the gameplay, fans of previous Capybara Games will be delighted to learn that the soundtrack is a collaboration between two of their previous composers: Jim Guthrie, who penned the soundtrack for Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP and Below, and Sam Webster, who wrote the soundtrack for Grindstone. BVN could well be amongst the best-sounding games of 2026, just on that legacy alone.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is set to launch initially on PC and the team are targeting being Steam Deck Verified, which seems like the perfect way to experience the puzzling action. As a huge fan of their previous games, BVN has dropped its way straight into my most-wanted list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162121/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Published by Ysbryd Games and developed by brlka, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> is an arduous platformer presented primarily in a retro 4:3 aspect ratio. It follows a teenage girl named Maya as she wends her way through a lonesome, though artfully-depicted, castle and the surreal, twisted memories that haunt it.</p>
<p>The game begins as many platformers do: through a series of progressively more challenging areas, I’m introduced to our white-haired protagonist’s limited, yet effective, skill set. Maya is able to jump and high jump, but her main ability flips gravity, sending her feet-first towards the top of the screen. The obstacles in the early areas are the expected spiked surfaces, moving platforms, and simple puzzles amid a variety of dark, unusual stages.</p>
<p>While the art as a whole is one of Love Eternal’s more tantalising draws, I was particularly taken by the hand-painted backdrops for each level. They suggest an expansiveness that would be difficult to achieve with the shape of each screen alone, while the thinly etched netting visibly draped over suburban neighbourhoods and palm trees hints at a larger picture of Maya’s prison.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162104/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Flipping gravity certainly isn't a unique inclusion for a platformer (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> is one example), but Love Eternal makes it the focus of gameplay to an engaging degree. Once Maya 'flips', she can’t do so again until she’s landed on a surface. Sometimes there are red orbs that recharge the ability if you touch them mid-air, which make a satisfying glass-shattering sound when struck.</p>
<p>Many levels require you to navigate through a maze of deadly impediments, all without ever touching the ground. Recharging the gravity flip is what makes this possible, with the red orbs acting almost as bouncing points that guide the way. But flipping isn't instantaneous. If you're barreling towards a spiked surface and flips too late, your residual momentum will smash Maya against the ceiling with a crackling gasp. It requires an almost mathematical eye towards timing and acceleration that nonetheless begins to become instinctual after a fashion.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162118/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A subtly unsettling score underlines your explorations throughout the castle--a welcoming softness in the contrast to the sharper sound effects of so many deaths. And make no mistake, you will die. A lot.</p>
<p>The game's difficulty embodies the traditional rhythm of platformers. As soon as I'd painstakingly mastered every minor motion and each instant of precise timing in one realm, I finally escaped the prison I started to loathe and am unleashed upon a new level that I'll have to learn a fresh sequence of tediously ordered movements to defeat. For those who love punishing platform mechanics, this is probably a boon. Those who only grind through high difficulty gameplay to unearth satisfying story elements might have a more mixed experience.</p>
<p>Love Eternal bills itself as a psychological horror. It seems to deliver on this promise in the first half, but the tone segues into strange humour and meta-narrative in the latter part of the game. Beware: there are some story spoilers ahead. The set-up is brief but chilling. Maya begrudgingly sits down to dinner with her family before being asked to go answer the phone. She follows the ringing into the hallway, and picks up the phone only to find silence on the other end. When she returns to the dining room, everyone is gone from the table and the front door is open. Walking outside is when the game starts in earnest, as Maya finds her home is just one of many ruins amidst an eerie landscape.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162113/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As Maya navigates the labyrinthine environment, she stumbles upon bizarre versions of her life and family members. Soon, she begins to uncover memories of others who were trapped like herself, and eventually she is confronted by the very entity who is holding her hostage.</p>
<p>This is where both the tone and gameplay take a definitive turn. This lonely 'god' delivers a literal PowerPoint presentation featuring clip art which, while funny, still manages to be frightening. Unfortunately, the deity basically lays out her entire plan and motive for trapping people. As with horror in any format, the more the curtain is pulled back on the mystery the less scary everything becomes.</p>
<p>After a chase sequence challenge (actually one of the easier levels for me), the game format changes in a manner reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a>. Suddenly, it isn't a side-scrolling platformer, but a first-person point-and-click. Maya appears to be back in her regular life, but something's obviously not quite right. She has a brother instead of a sister, and her dad isn’t the same man that’s shown earlier in the game but instead another one of the god’s trapped pets. Most notably, the begrudged god has taken on the role of Lacey—a friend referenced in earlier scenes as having bailed on plans with her.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162115/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly, the gameplay in this section leaves a lot to be desired. Your actions are generally limited to “look,” “talk,” “use,” and “move.” Each scene requires you to select these to progress, but it’s an illusion of choice. I wasn’t even allowed to pour my cereal in the wrong order by putting the milk in first. Lack of control can be horrifying, but in this case it was more boring than anything else. Despite some genuinely skin-crawling moments, I didn't find this part enjoyable to play through and it disrupted the pacing significantly.</p>
<p>While she eventually breaks her way back out into the platforming side of the game, there is another framing shift towards the meta that comes later on. Essentially, the game starts over, but a streamer is “playing” the game. She narrates gameplay, but the player maintains control of Maya’s movements.</p>
<p>The streamer is given different levels to play than the actual sequence from the beginning of the game, including the final level. I know that I must have taken longer than intended to beat it because the streamer ran out of dialogue well before I was able to get through.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162112/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, I occasionally had an issue where the sound would cut in and out. Going without it highlighted for me how much I had been relying on the red gem sound effect to help time my movements. I found that restarting the game did restore the sound, but it still cut out a few more times during my playthrough.</p>
<p>The ending was more trippy than substantive, and it left me feeling like I'd missed something. There was yet another game within a game at the very end: a more old-school style action adventure. I’m sure someone will enjoy figuring out what happens if you can progress far enough within it, but by the time I got my “game over,” I was happy to leave my Love Eternal experience in its pretty grave.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The platforming elements of Love Eternal are delightfully frustrating fun with a limited set of mechanics put to creative and clean use. Multiple levels had me holding my breath, gritting my teeth, and cursing the wayward god who founded the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn levels are as beautiful as their challenges are frustrating. Unfortunately, an overly ambitious narrative coupled with a strange mid-game shift mars the game's myriad charms.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Thinks ARC Raiders Players are Defeating Matriarchs “Too Early,” Admits it Gave Players “Too Effective Abilities” Against the Giants]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-gave-arc-raiders-players-too-effective-abilities-take-down-matriarchs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When you start your journey in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, certain ARCs, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-guide-the-most-annoying-arcs-and-how-to-deal-with-them/"><strong>Rocketeers</strong> and <strong>Bastion's</strong></a>, can send a chill down the spine of any new Raider. You'll eventually learn how to take these machines down, but there's always something bigger waiting in the wings, and in this new extraction shooter, that 'something bigger' is the <strong>Matriarchs</strong>. </p>



<p>They're the closest thing ARC Raiders has to a boss encounter. You can't take them down yourself (not without some serious luck and know-how), and they're arguably the most deadly machines you'll face as far as the game's PvE elements are concerned. But that hasn't stopped players from figuring out how to take them down, and how to do it very, very quickly, especially when an entire server is charging the six-legged giants. </p>



<p>According to <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, however, that's not how fights against Matriarchs are supposed to go. At least, not when you're still early in your in-game journey. They're meant to be tough encounters that you'll struggle with, even with mid-tier gear. But since when have players done something precisely the way game designers intended them to?</p>



<p>As Embark Studios' design director, <strong>Virgil Watkins</strong>, admits in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-admits-arc-raiders-bosses-are-dying-too-fast-because-theyre-not-intended-for-the-full-server-to-go-up-against-and-we-gave-players-too-effective-abilities/">PC Gamer</a>, working with that assumption is on the team at Embark for making players "<em>too effective</em>" in the early game with the kinds of abilities they have at their disposal.</p>



<p>"<em>Even though [Queens and Matriarchs are] huge and deadly, they're not intended for the full server to go up against and get equally rewarded. It is meant to be, you know, a couple of dedicated squads, maybe working together while also dealing with other players,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's definitely on us to an extent...I think we gave players <strong>too effective abilities to take down these things too early</strong>. So they were tuned more for what I would call mid-game gear.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, this doesn't mean you can expect a future update where Matriarchs and Queens get a huge buff. That might be part of the solution for Embark, but it's not the whole picture. The team would rather have a solution that addresses the different playstyles they're seeing from Raiders to better address the problem.</p>



<p>"<em>Do we reward the people who might pick their moment well, and go get some scraps from part of the fight and then sneak away?...Are you going to be the guy who capitalizes at the end of the fight because everyone's worn down and out of ammo, or are you the one who's trying to pull everyone together and have the fight on even terms?"</em></p>



<p>It's not just these boss encounters that Embark is looking to tweak. The <strong>Hidden Bunker</strong> and <strong>Locked Gate</strong> activities are also something the studio wants to change, because it's noticed that players will just wait by the doors, waiting for them to be opened by someone else, rather than go out and properly engage with the challenge of crossing the map to get the appropriate keys themselves.</p>



<p>"<em>When we built them, we had an idealized way we hoped people would engage. And then, you know, as players always do, they find this sort of meta throughline,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's where we can go look at those existing map conditions...it's about us trying to keep the spirit of those, but adjust the mechanics."</em></p>



<p>Essentially, if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players signing on to play ARC Raiders every day, expect to see some changes to how the game operates going forward, with the game seemingly leaning towards becoming even more challenging. Hopefully, Embark is able to keep the game fun and engaging without overdoing it.</p>



<p>And if you're a player who took severe advantage of the coins duplication glitch, you can probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">expect a suspension coming your way</a> in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-toronto-splinter-cell-remake-lays-off-more-developers-fired-2000671331</link>
            <guid>1440529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>More cuts are happening at Ubisoft. The company has confirmed layoffs at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind games like <em>Watch Dogs, Splinter Cell Blacklist,</em> and <em>Far Cry 6. </em>But don’t worry, that long-in-development-and-still-totally-happening <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake is fine, okay?</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">as first reported by <em>MobileSyrup</em>,</a> layoffs hit Ubisoft Toronto as the company continues to cut costs as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">a larger corporate restructure</a>. That process started last year following an infusion of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion from Tencent</a> that saw the company assume shared control over some of Ubisoft’s key franchises, like <em>Assassin’s Creed.&nbsp;</em>As part of this big shake-up, many Ubisoft devs have been laid off and multiple projects, including a long-in-development remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,</em></a> have been cancelled. 40 developers were laid off, according to Ubisoft.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">first announced in 2021</a>, was still in active development despite the layoffs. That doesn’t really provide me with any confidence that the game will eventually ship, considering what happened to the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake earlier this year. And now it will have to be made with even fewer people to help.</p> <p>“Following the recent announcement of the final phase of Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the discontinuation of projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be reducing its workforce by 40 roles. This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected. Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance,” said Ubisoft in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the studio will continue supporting projects such as <em>Rainbow Six</em> as a co-developer. In an internal employees-only email shared with <em>MobileSyrup</em>, the company explained that Ubisoft Toronto will remain a “key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mamma mia, there’s a new <em>Mario</em> game available to play today. But before you get too excited, you should know that the just-released<em> Hello, Mario&nbsp;</em>isn’t a 3D or 2D platformer, sports game, or other zany spin-off. Instead, it’s a small app that lets kids play around with Mario’s face until he gets tired and goes to sleep, forcing your child to do something else, like load up TikTok.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hello-mario-switch/">Nintendo released <em>Hello, Mario</em> on Android, iOS, Switch, and Switch 2</a>. It’s less of a game and more of an interactive digital kids’ toy starring everyone’s favorite hopping plumber, Mario. Or at least his face. Players can yank on different parts of Mario’s head and face to get different reactions while also stretching the famed platformer in odd-looking ways. You can also tap on different parts of his head to give him sunglasses, play peek-a-boo, or even run a comb through his moustache. It’s similar to how you could mess with Mario’s head in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, if a bit less charming.</p>

  <p>At one point, I yanked on Mario’s nose and right ear, pulling them violently in different directions, and he shouted, “Oh, yeah, Mario Time!” I didn’t realize Mario was into this kind of stuff. We learn something new about him in each game, y’know? Anyway, after about 12 minutes, Mario stopped letting me squeeze and pinch his face and went to sleep. This is a feature Nintendo says will help limit screentime for your kids. But you can just do something else on the phone or even restart the app, and he’ll be up and ready to go again.</p> <p><em>Hello, Mario </em>is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/">part of a new brand line from Nintendo called “My Mario.”</a> Here’s how Nintendo describes this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>The My Mario collection is thoughtfully designed to bring smiles to the faces of young children, their parents, and caregivers while inspiring imaginative play. Select items have been developed in collaboration with a range of licensed partners, including Fisher-Price and TOMY.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s nice, but this really just feels like Nintendo trying to turn babies into good, loyal fans of Mario as soon as possible. It reminds me of the stuff Disney and other big media companies have been doing for years now by slapping their characters on baby food, diapers, tiny toys, etc. Get them hooked on some IP before they can even say their first word. Smart business. But also kinda gross.</p>

<p>Onto hardware now, and, as will come as a surprise to nobody, the Switch 2 is still way ahead of the pack. OLED sales surged last week, pushing up over the 20,000 mark and skewing things firmly in Switch 1's favour against the PS5 when combining the SKU sales — Switch 1 pulled in 26,521, while the three PS5 models got 11,588.</p>
<p>And let's give a shoutout to the PS4, which nabbed another 25 sales this week and <em>somehow</em> managed to outsell the Xbox Series X. Hey, that's the power of Yakuza.</p>

The Chinese Room says the partnership with the publisher builds on Lyrical's "commitment to backing distinctive, high-craft projects".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The Chinese Room CEO Ed Daly says the partnership will give the studio the "confidence and support to push creatively" in order to "stand out in today's market", while Lyrical head Blake Rochkind says the developer's next game has a "strong vision" and that his company is aiming to "remove friction" from development.</p><p>Assuming this project is next in The Chinese Room's pipeline, it'll be the studio's first game since last year's poorly-received <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">spent a long time</a> in development hell before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"rescued" by the British developer</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor reception, former Chinese Room head Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggested that the game shouldn't have been released</a> under the <em>Bloodlines </em>name, which created expectations the studio was unable to meet.</p><p>Whether Pinchbeck is right or not, <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released as <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-financials-bloodlines-2-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cdaf779b-8a75-48a8-9d81-99d3be95566b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">resulted in a pretty dismal year</a> for publisher Paradox thanks to its failure. It's probably safe to say that whatever The Chinese Room's next game is, it's not <em>Bloodlines 3</em>.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room might have been the outfit behind <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but the studio is usually better-known for its contemplative narrative games (which some might refer to as "walking simulators") like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c24b924e-d035-4ba1-a306-060800f9d7e1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</em>.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether this project is more like those games than <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but for now, it looks like The Chinese Room has secured a publisher, at least.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>When the website of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> suddenly began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-highguards-website-goes-dark-a-report-emerges-that-the-not-so-indie-shooter-was-funded-by-tencent">blaring that it was "unavailable"</a> not long after news broke of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">layoffs at developer Wildlight</a>, you could have been forgiven for thinking a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>-style pulling offline might be in the shooter's near future. That doesn't look to be the case, though, with the studio having just announced a couple of new additions set to arrive in the game this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These additions are a new base called Cloudreach and a raid toll called the Lockpick, both of which are set to arrive in a patch set to drop "later this week". The base is noteworthy for being home to a massive airship, which sounds like a key element in keeping battles on it varied. "The deck surrounding the airship overlooks the entire area, giving defenders an elevated position to snipe from, but allows quick repositioning to both generator rooms, where combat quickly turns close quarters," Wildlight wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lockpick isn't a lockpick. It's actually a dart gun you can fire to "open doors and windows, temporarily disabling them for the enemy and giving control to your team". I guess calling it the Handle's Worst Enemy instead would have been a bit lame. Anyway, the patch is also delivering a mount called a Moonbruin, which look a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Owlbears.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"We are also working on our next patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things," Wildlight wrote to round out their post.</p><p>So, the shooter's set to keep on trucking for the time being, with this patch news backing up an <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">admin on the official Highguard Discord</a>'s assertion earlier this week that the website being down was simply a matter of fixing it currently being "low priority".</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem spoilers are out in the wild, and while many are looking to avoid them, others are actively hunting them down to find out the fate of Leon Kennedy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> releases <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-times/" id="177650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 27</a>, and Leon Kennedy is one of two playable characters in the game, alongside Grace Ashcroft. While Grace is a new face in the series, Leon is an established name in the franchise, and his fate is a significant talking point.</p>



<p>If you’re actively on the hunt to find out what happens to Leon Kennedy, the answer is below. If you don’t want anything spoiled, look away now!</p>



<p><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. This is your last chance to leave!</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-does-leon-kennedy-die-in-resident-evil-requiem">Does Leon Kennedy Die in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fate is sealed. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The fate of Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem depends on the ending you experience, as there are two different endings you can encounter.</strong></p>



<p>Only one of these is the canon ending, however, which Capcom will use moving forward as the main timeline for the Resident Evil franchise. If you’re a fan of Leon Kennedy, the good news is that he’s not dead in canon, and will be around for future entries in the series.</p>

</ul>



<p>It is possible to have Leon die in your save, however, as the ‘bad’ ending results in his death. The ending ultimately comes down to a big choice of what you choose to do with Elpis.</p>



<p>If you choose to release Elpis, the ‘good’, and canonically, ending is shown, whereas choosing to destroy Elpis ultimately leads to the death of Leon Kennedy.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-to-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem">What Happens to Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p><strong>As mentioned, the ultimate fate of Leon Kennedy depends on the action you choose to take with Elpis, but both endings have a significant impact.</strong></p>



<p>In the ‘good ending’, Victor Gideon appears at the end of the game to kill Zeno, and Elpis is released. This cures Leon’s infection, resulting in him de-ageing and becoming younger. It’s not entirely clear where Capcom plans to go from here, but making him younger in canon opens the door for him to star again in the future.</p>

</ul>



<p>The difference in the bad ending is that Gideon does not appear to save Leon from Zeno, who subsequently explodes Leon’s head. He doesn’t survive either, however, as the platform they are both on collapses.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Ending Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> is packed with lore that slowly comes together across each chapter. There’s a core narrative to follow, but players willing to dig deeper will uncover layers of hidden details and disturbing revelations scattered throughout the game.</p>



<p>Many fans expected Chapter 5 to finally provide the answers, especially with speculation that it would serve as the series’ finale. Instead, it delivers one of the biggest cliff-hangers yet, raising even more questions about how Mob Entertainment plans to conclude the story.</p>







<p>If you’re trying to piece together what it all means, you’re in the right place—Insider Gaming has broken down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> ending and explored what it could signal for the future of the franchise.</p>



<p>It should go without saying, but just in case it was unclear, <strong>Major spoilers ahead!</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-ending-explained">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Ending Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>At long last. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ending kicks off with Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy finally being reunited with one another—that is, until the Prototype barges in. </strong></p>



<p>After evading him at Lily Lovebraids’ tea party, the Prototype is back with a vengeance, as they make swift work of Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy, practically killing them in the process—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though their fates remain up in the air</a>. </p>



<p>It’s every man for themselves at this point, and the protagonist swiftly boards the train in an effort to escape the hulking Prototype. However, the metallic, arachnid body manages to keep up, and after a back and forth across the carriages, the train explodes with the Prototype onboard. </p>

</ul>



<p>You didn’t think it’d be that easy, did you? Before long, he rises out of the wreckage and gives the protagonist the same treatment that they gave the Wuggys—a sharp stab through the chest. As if that wasn’t bad enough, you’re dumped into a vat of Poppy Gel and left for dead. </p>







<p>Thankfully, Giblet is there to save the day, as you’re revived and shocked back to life. It’s revealed that the Prototype took off with Poppy, and you might think that Chapter 5 would end there, but there’s still one more big reveal left in store…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-backup-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">What Is The Backup In Poppy Playtime Chapter 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>He’s back. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not over yet, as you and Giblet finally arrive at the Data Storage, where the ‘Backup’ is supposed to be. </strong></p>



<p>You’ve been searching for it all chapter, and now it’s right in front of you. An old computer lies there waiting to be turned on, and once you bypass the Override, it’s finally activated, only for a familiar face—or eye—to be revealed. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-cost-price-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-cost-price-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Much Does Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Cost? Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The Backup isn’t just some files or documents that might help you defeat the Prototype. No, it’s much worse than that, as it’s none other than Harley Sawyer—the man behind converting orphans into the monstrous toys you’re constantly evading. As the computer boots up, the same eye flickers, looks around, before dropping one final, haunting line to close out the chapter. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Well now, this is a rather interesting turn of events…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Will he be friend or foe? Does he know how to destroy the Prototype? And will he even be willing to help you? There are tons of questions left unanswered once the credits roll, and it’s going to be an excruciating wait before an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inevitable Chapter 6 rolls around</a>, but one thing is clear: Harley Sawyer is back, and you’re going to need his help.</p>

            <p>
If you're anything like me, the second Nintendo announced it'd be giving select Switch 1 titles a fancy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> makeover, you probably immediately starting compiling a wish list. The Xenoblade series was high on mine, but remained persistently unloved. Until now that is! Out of nowhere, Nintendo just released an upgrade for last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition - and better still, it's available now.
</p>
<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, follows similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some have been free, some (namely the ones with a bunch of additional content) have had a heftier price tag, while some updates have arrived with a nominal fee.

<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition falls into the latter camp, and owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the new Switch 2 Edition for £4.19/$4.99 USD. And what does that get you? According to Nintendo, 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. It doesn't sound like anything else is included, so you might well wonder why Nintendo hasn't followed previous form and provided this zero-content update for free (probably, money?).
</p><p>
Regardless, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-3026104.html">available on the eShop right now</a>, both as an upgrade and a full game. However, a physical Switch 2 edition is set to launch on 16th April, if you prefer your games small, red, and solid.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Now do Xenoblade Chronicles 2 next Nintendo, please.

		<p>With no build up or fanfare, Nintendo and Monolith Soft have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition…. edition, a paid upgrade to the game that brings technical improvements for the new generation hardware. Check out the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUGn2wulm_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrade is a fairly straightforward technical boost, now with a 60fps target through the game and 4K docked and 1080p handheld resolutions. We don’t know if Monolith has leant upon upscaling techniques or variable resolutions to get there, but this should make for a sharper looking, more responsive game in general.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can be bought all together on the Nintendo eShop or with a $5 / £4.19 upgrade for existing owners of the Switch release. A physical release will be available from April 16th.</p>
<p>One of the last Wii U cult classics to be ported to the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X arrived in March of last year. With it still fresh in Monolith’s memory, it’s understandable why they would return to this first, but fans of the series will understandably be pining for a similar Switch 2 Edition treatment to be given to Xenoblade Chronicles 2, 3 and the Definitive Edition of the Wii original. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 would probably receive the greatest benefits, as Monolith’s first effort with the Switch did have its struggles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">our review of the Switch 1 release</a>, Dom said, “With a smattering of improvements as it jumps to Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers up an epic sci-fi tale set in one of the very best open worlds.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Viral Hit 'POOLS' Surfaces On Switch Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/viral-hit-pools-surfaces-on-switch-next-week</link>
            <guid>1440451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Finnish dev Tensori's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pools1">POOLS</a> (sorry, POOLS) is a self-proclaimed walking sim with uncanny vibes. It launched back in 2024 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2663530/POOLS/">on Steam</a> and has racked up nearly 3000 user reviews in the time since, leaving it in the rarified "Overwhelmingly Positive" range on Valve's platform, and it's coming to Switch on 26th February.</p>
<p>As you can see from the trailer above — running native Switch footage, we're told — it looks pleasingly minimal and rather lovely, but don't go in expecting pure cosy vibes, or much else, for that matter, because the list of things this "liminal fever dream" <em>doesn't</em> feature is sizeable.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb, there's "no user-interface", "no dialogue", "no background music", "no typical story", "no characters to meet", no "notes" to find, "no hand-holding", and "no monsters chasing you or jumping suddenly towards you".</p>
<p>One for the misanthropes, perhaps? If you've had your fill of online chat and pings and squads and cosy character dialogue, a couple of hours' jaunt to your local '70s swimming complex — inexplicably and unsettlingly empty and pristine — sounds like just the ticket. And given the enormous number of monsters likely to be chasing and/or jumping suddenly towards you on just one day later on Switch 2 (courtesy of Capcom), a little genuine alone time sounds great.</p>
<p>For everything it <em>doesn't</em> have, Pools apparently contains atmosphere by the bucketload, using diegetic audio to ramp up the tension in these white-tiled, maze-like spaces where something's not <em>quite</em> right. This Switch (1) version includes the full OG game plus the "Chapter 0" free expansion, as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few more details and some docked Switch screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you explore and advance further, you start to notice that the game's world changes around you. Rooms look and feel different. Each chapter has something unique. Constantly you're exploring new places, each with its own kind of mystery.</p>
<p>POOLS is inspired by internet phenomenons "Liminal spaces", "Found footage" and "Backrooms" - specifically "Backrooms Pools" or "Poolrooms".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There'll be a demo available on launch day if you're not convinced by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-exquisite-liminality-of-zelda-skyward-sword">all this liminal stuff</a>. The full game will set you back $9.79 / £8.50 / 9,75€ or your regional equivalent.</p>
<p>Our friends over at Push Square reviewed the PSVR2 version, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psvr2/pools">awarding it an 8/10</a> and saying that "while it’s a short-lived experience, it’s one we couldn’t help but admire. It certainly caters to a niche audience, but it quickly creates a unique and tense atmosphere that plays with your head." We'll find out how Switch handles it soon enough.</p>

<p><em>It took great effort to avoid all the 'coming up for air', 'making a splash', 'dipping a toe', 'taking the plunge' metaphors on this one, just the surfacing one in the headline. Let us know if you're impressed by that and/or the game in the usual place.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/viral-hit-pools-surfaces-on-switch-next-week]]></content:encoded>

<p>The only unfortunate aspect of this week's batch of games is that only two of them are arriving as <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> titles, but at least both of those titles are brand new releases. The games in question are <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-review/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a></strong>, both of which you can check out reviews for on Wccftech.</p>



<p>On top of those titles, players will also be able to check out <strong>Norse: Oath of Blood</strong>, which, alongside the aforementioned games, also supports NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-styx-blades-of-greed-star-trek-voyager/">DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation</a>.

<p>No one ever thought the day would come when we would return to the bombed-out, decrepit remains of Raccoon City. Resident Evil Requiem gives everyone one more round, and if you’re ready to load the chamber again, find out when the Resident Evil Requiem release date is and expected release times.</p>



<p>There’s always a special vibe when a new Resi game is on the way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> isn’t <em>just</em> a new game; it brings back Leon Kennedy for his first new outing since Resident Evil 6 (not counting the remakes). Throw in Grace Ashcroft, a lot of combat, puzzles, and the odd zombie, and you know you’re in for a good time.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-resident-evil-requiem-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Resident Evil Requiem Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new, terrifying tale. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has set a date with destiny for February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When Requiem was first announced, there were so many questions: How will Grace differ from Chris, Jill, Leon, and everyone that came before? Then, with RPD being sighted, we wondered if Leon was going to make one final bow.</p>

</ul>



<p>So much has been learned since Requiem first came to light. Once the February 27 release date was locked in, it immediately became a date for the diary. Whether you’re taking a mysterious sick day or you’ve booked it off, everyone will be there on launch day for the next chapter in the mainline timeline. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-release-times">Resident Evil 9 Release Times</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could change. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to the PlayStation Store, Resident Evil Requiem launches at 9 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Companies generally only post release time sheets on social media a day or two before launch. Right now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has done no such thing for Requiem. On the plus side, the PlayStation Store is known for posting an early look at a game’s launch time.</p>



<p>However, it must be said that this isn’t 100% accurate. It could change, and if it does, check back in as the guide is updated with new information to reflect this.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Hey, who's enjoying their Thursday? And who's looking forward to playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> later today?</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly — Nintendo has just dropped the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, which landed on Switch in March 2025.</p>
<p>If you already own the game on Switch, the upgrade pack will cost <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or if you don't have the game yet, then you can grab the Switch 2 Edition on the eShop for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Those rumoured 60fps frames you thought would come eventually? They're right here in this upgrade pack. Docked resolution has also received a bump to 4K — if you have a TV that supports it. Otherwise, it'll just look smoother across the board.</p>
<p>A physical release will follow on 16th April 2026.</p>

While that version was a significant visual step up from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wii U</strong> original, it notably lacked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS gameplay</strong>, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/"><strong>high framerate mode</strong></a> being discovered hidden deep within its files.</p>



<p>As many speculated at the time, that discovery was clearly groundwork for the <strong><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em></strong>, which officially launched digitally worldwide today.</p>

The delay is being put into place so that Bungie can "include sizable quality-of-life updates".</p><p>Not only has the update been delayed, but it'll also be renamed now as well, so when it does arrive, make sure you're not looking for patch notes for Shadow and Order, because they won't exist.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Previously-announced features like weapon tier upgrading will still be included in whatever Shadow and Order ends up being called, but Bungie is also adding new features like tier 5 stats for Exotic armor sets, expanding Tiered Gear to raids and dungeons, and more.</p><p><em>Destiny 2 </em>isn't going to sleep between now and June, either; Bungie promises that the game will receive regular quality-of-life updates before then, as well as the Guardian Games event in March and "the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence" in April.</p><p>Don't expect too much more info about Shadow and Order anytime soon, though; Bungie says it'll reveal more about the update, as well as what's coming next for <em>Destiny 2</em>, "closer to launch", and doesn't provide a more specific date than that.</p><p>News of this <em>Destiny 2 </em>update delay comes as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-march-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06a260e7-cfea-4d2e-a2bf-946953eeac4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">release date for extraction shooter <em>Marathon</em></a><em> </em>rapidly approaches.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/880971/abxylute-n6-switch-2-hands-on-controller</link>
            <guid>1440397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Gaming accessory company Abxylute has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2">Kickstarter campaign</a> for its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/872223/abxylute-nintendo-switch-2-controller-n6-n9c-gamecube-retro">N6 and GameCube-style N9C Switch 2 dock-style controllers</a>. If the ergonomics of Nintendo’s Joy-Cons don’t jibe with you, these aim to be solid alternatives, particularly for people with medium-to-large-size hands.</p></div><p>Both of Abxylute’s new controllers have bigger, more comfortable grips than Joy-Cons offer, along with longer-lasting Hall effect joysticks. I tested a functioning prototype of the N6, and it has almost everything that people might be looking for to level up their gaming experience: full-size sticks, vibration, motion controls, customizable back paddles, and turbo mode for spamming commands.</p><p>What the N6 is going for isn’t anything new. CRKD popularized the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review">slide-in form factor with the original Switch</a>. It adds thick grips to your console to make it look and feel more like a Steam Deck. For as much as it added to ergonomics, it stood out as a solution for the Switch’s Joy-Con drift drama by offering Hall effect sticks that won’t degrade. The N6 doesn’t mess with that formula very much. It has full-size Hall effect joysticks that are grippier and feature a concave top so your thumb can rest instead of sliding off. It has thick grips that go around the console’s back to let your fingers spread out, and its triggers are bigger and offer more tactile feedback.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Adding more grip to the back of the console doesn’t mean I don’t want more surface area on the front. Also, the edges of the Switch 2 that stick out from the controller look silly.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The thing is, the N6 doesn’t feel like as much of an upgrade over Joy-Cons as the Nitro Deck, based on my time with a functional prototype. For one, the left and right sticks are too low for my medium-size hands to comfortably reach with my fingers fully extended around its grips, making the D-pad and any of the system-level buttons below them especially tricky to access in a pinch. People with larger hands would likely have more trouble.</p><p>You might not experience issues if you have small hands, and/or if you primarily play games that don’t require fast reaction times. The N6 can handle fast reactions, but I never felt confident enough in my grip to execute twitchy commands with precision.</p><p>The ergonomics could be improved if Abxylute made the left and right sides of the controller taller and spread out the sticks and buttons more. That would make it easier for more people to fully grip the N6 without struggling to reach the sticks or buttons. As it is, I have to hold it in a precarious claw grip to play some games. Taller controls would also cover the top left and top right edges of the Switch 2, which are inexplicably exposed by the N6’s design.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Where my thumb naturally wants to rest, which just so happens to be where the joystick is located on the Joy-Con.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Several aspects of the N6 remain in development, including how the rumble feels (strong, not attempting HD rumble, but also not terrible), and how the buttons and triggers sound (very pronounced — I’d get in trouble using this around my wife while she’s reading at night).</p><p>Abxylute proactively shared a list of known issues it’s working to address before the final release in April, which I think is a good move from a company that’s hoping to earn your pledge:</p><div><ul><li><span>Shoulder Buttons (L/R): You might hear a louder clicking sound or feel a slight wobble/instability. We are currently optimizing the components to ensure a more comfortable feel.</span></li><li><span>ABXY Buttons: On some units, these may feel stiff, have inconsistent travel, or make a loud rebound sound. We are switching to a new conductive silicone pad in mass production to ensure a consistent, quiet, and comfortable press.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Vibration/Haptics: The motor is currently too aggressive/noisy, and it may miss some subtle low-frequency vibrations. We are tuning the driver to fix this.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Cosmetics: For the Blue model, the silk-screen text on the back is currently too dark.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Build Tolerance: On individual units, you might notice slight inconsistencies in the feel of +/- buttons or a small gap on the right side. These will be tightened in production.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Also, a note from the author: the prototype gets firmware updates through its USB-C port (it included a female to male USB-C cable to update it), but the mass production models will get wireless OTA updates from your smartphone.</span></li></ul></div><p>Abxylute is asking HK$ 618, or about $80, for the N6 as an early backer special price. It offered a limited allotment at this price, and it has already sold through most of them by the time of publication. Whether it gets more expensive after crowdfunding or not, it’s within the price range of the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">$99.99 CRKD Nitro Deck 2</a> coming this Spring that offers many extra features. Based on my experience with an early N6 prototype, I’m not convinced it’s worth getting a controller that leaves much of your console exposed and struggles with ergonomics.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/880971/abxylute-n6-switch-2-hands-on-controller]]></content:encoded>
