The app will include scripted “kid-friendly” podcasts, interactive games, jokes, video recipes, crafting ideas, e-books, and original, exclusive streaming shows. One of these shows will feature the Chick-fil-A cows—stars of the chain’s long-running “Eat Mor Chikin” campaign—and another is <em>Evergreen Hills. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/SuGam8-iOng&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/SuGam8-iOng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the first trailer for <em>Evergreen Hills</em></a></span>, which appears to be an animated series about kids discovering some magical tree, and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/3IPMq4-mLd4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/3IPMq4-mLd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a series of ads from a few years ago</a></span>. </p><p> If you’re curious, the animated series starring cows will likely look a lot like this short released by Chick-fil-A a few months ago. I’ll let you decide if that’s a good thing or not. Also, just say the words “A Chick-fil-A Original Story” a few times out loud and really marinate in how bad this all is.</p><p>And now, here’s a human being trying to convince you that it’s totally normal and logical that a fast food restaurant that serves chicken sandwiches should also make TV shows for kids. From the press release:</p><p>“Hospitality and fun have always been at the core of the Chick-fil-A family experience, whether inside our Restaurants and play areas, or through our Kids Meals,” said Dustin Britt, executive director of brand strategy. “The Chick-fil-A Play App is a digital extension of that experience and another way we’re reimagining ‘Play’ for our Guests, in a unique way through entertainment that really encourages time together.”<br></p><p>That’s a terrifying amount of buzzwords and nonsense crammed into one paragraph, but it is October, so I guess it’s perfectly spooky. Anyway, if you want to watch any of this stuff or read books approved by Chick-fil-A, the app goes live on Apple and Android on November 18. Enjoy? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Similar to <em>Skyblivion</em>, a project aimed at remaking <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> using <em>Skyrim</em>, <em>Vault 13</em> was aimed at translating the original isometric, non-open-world <em>Fallout </em>into a modern Bethesda RPG. </p><p>The publisher has made clear it’s not working on a remaster or remake itself anytime soon, so fans took it upon themselves to reimagine the classic with all the bells and whistles of the most recent numbered entry in the franchise. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1actmxI6fM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1actmxI6fM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bit of this dream was even playable</a></span>. </p><p>But according to the latest status update from the team behind it, <em>Fallout: Vault 13</em> is officially mothballed. “Vault 13 was suspended due to a combination of factors, including burnout, difficulty in recruiting and retaining team members with niche skills, and personal life changes among core team members,” read a statement on their Discord via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-1-fan-remake-taps-out-just-2-months-after-it-got-a-meaty-demo-but-promises-its-not-because-of-infighting-or-bethesda-meddling/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-1-fan-remake-taps-out-just-2-months-after-it-got-a-meaty-demo-but-promises-its-not-because-of-infighting-or-bethesda-meddling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>. </p><p>While it might be easy to suspect that Bethesda was in some way to blame—the publisher has announced its own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1848153050734641370&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1848153050734641370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fallout</em> anniversary showcase</a></span> for October 23—the modders on <em>Vault 13 </em>say that’s not the case. “There was no infighting or cease and desist from Bethesda,” they said. “The decision was made to prioritize the well-being of project members.”</p><p>While <em>Fallout 1</em> getting an unofficial remake anytime soon is no longer in the cards, <em>Fallout 2</em> still has a shot.

<p>Whenever a brand-new survival horror hits the market, content creators and fans rush to finish it before spoilers wind up online. It’s often a race to the finish. But sometimes, players can’t get enough of the horror genre despite their insistent fear. They want to know how long it takes to complete a game like this. So, here’s what you should know about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">How Long to Beat A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?</h2>



<p>If you want to finish A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, expect to play for approximately 6 to 8 hours total. Most players finish the game in around 7 hours, give or take. However, you can stretch the experience by playing immensely carefully, watching your every step, and reading all the notes scattered throughout the environment for additional backstory. </p>



<p>My first playthrough lasted around eight hours, during which time I immersed myself in the environment instead of playing my usual run-and-gun horror game.</p>



<p>All that said, this is a straightforward, story-based survival horror experience without much side content. Besides a handful of collectibles, the odd note or drawing left behind by another survivor, and some valuable pick-ups scattered about the world, you won’t find much besides a linear path forward.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-multiplayer">Is A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Of course, a survival horror game with multiplayer would add considerable length to any experience, but sadly, that’s not happening here. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player game focusing on the story of Alex Taylor, an asthmatic college student doing her best to survive the end of the world. You won’t play co-op or versus in this tale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-dev-likely-revealed-as-octopath-traveler-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another mystery solved?</h2></div><section><p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership's mystery developer has finally been revealed, and it's not who many expected. While a number of fans guessed ILCA, Next Level, or even a new studio made up of former AlphaDream developers, the actual answer seems to be Acquire, co-developers behind Octopath Traveler.</p><p>We (probably) know this from various screenshots posted from one of the game's official pages being shared around online, which attributes the copyright to the game to both Nintendo and Acquire. While it's always possible all these images going around are doctored somehow, this is also how we found out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake was made by ArtePiazza</a>, so it's pretty unlikely.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CONFIRMED: Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership was co-developed by Acquire (Octopath Traveler, Tenchu, Way of the Samurai) <a href="https://t.co/MNZvtqdcPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MNZvtqdcPE</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Acquire is one heck of a storied studio. It's a Japanese company founded waaaay back in 1994 that made its mark with the Tenchu: Stealth Assassins franchise, and has since gone on to make a number of games across several platforms. It was especially productive on the PlayStation Vita and PSP, but its most notable contribution perhaps is as a co-developer on Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2. Over the years it's been acquired by GungHo Online Entertainment, which owned it from 2011 until this year, when it was picked up by FromSoftware owned Kadokawa Corporation.</p><p>This year alone, Acquire released Ancient Weapon Holly, C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield, Scars of Mars, and something called Hookah Haze. It also co-developed Amedama and All in Abyss: Judge the Fake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Given Acquire's track record, especially with Octopath Traveler, the news about Acquire's work on Brothership is being received fairly well, although with some surprise. This is Acquire's first time developing a first-party Nintendo title, and it's interesting to see Nintendo branching out to even more external developers beyond its usual stable of Game Freak, DeNA, Grezzo, Camelot, Next Level, Good-Feel, ArtePiazza, Intelligent, and others. </p><p>That said, it remains very weird that we have to play these goofy games of checking French copyright info to see who makes Nintendo's biggest annual titles. We did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake">Super Mario RPG Remake</a>, we did it with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-interview-reveals-host-of-new-details-including-confirmation-of-series-first-woman-director">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtimes-director-developer-have-finally-been-revealed">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, we even dealt with something like this when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-wonder-mick-wingert-nintendo">Mario got a new voice actor</a>. Just tell us upfront who the devs are, Nintendo! We promise we won't get mad.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

But like so many of the internet's other great joys, those posts come at an unseen cost. </p><p>While we've all been enjoying SMB's trivia for years now, I don't know if too many people ever stopped to think about the man behind the account, or the circumstances that allowed him to post so often,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAPGbeknudY" target="_blank">so it was certainly a shock last week to see Supper Mario Broth's current owner post an emotional video outlining their position</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he has spent the last few years caring for a number of sick relatives, including his mother, and that following the latter's sad passing recently he was not only facing a loss of income (he had received a pension as a caregiver) but even the prospect of losing his home as well.&nbsp;Unless...people could help him out.</p><p>The response to the video has been overwhelming. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/suppermariobroth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have flooded SMB's Patreon page</a> to pledge financial support for the account, and at time of posting over 3700 people had signed up for monthly accounts, transforming it instantly from a hobby (the Patreon page had already existed, but wasn't doing numbers like this) to a full-time occupation.&nbsp;Indeed it's so much money that he says it'll start being funnelled back into the account, telling fans "any additional support will be used to procure material and acquire equipment to make more and better Mario content".</p><p>This rules. Supper Mario Broth is one of the most enjoyable and authoritative&nbsp;Nintendo voices on the internet, and it's wonderful news to hear it'll be able to keep on posting for the foreseeable future. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the disillusioned noble Strohl to the songstress superstar Junah, <em>Metaphor </em>has a truly weird group of goofballs who are gathering together to try and make real change in the world of Euchronia. Though they’re all united by a desire to make the world a better place for its citizens, a lot of these folks could not be more different. How can one compare Hulkenberg’s gloomy struggles with tragedy to Eupha overcoming her naivete? Well, we’re certainly going to try. Here’s the <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>cast from least perfect and good to most perfect and good.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-recommend-id="image://75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-recommend-id="image://75a429a06dfa166b2b93dba2160d4a79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gallica waves at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gallica, our fairy helper, isn’t a party member in the traditional sense, but rather acts as a navigator for the team, checking for enemy weaknesses, and just generally being a companion to the protagonist. She’s a little sassy, but believes deeply in the group’s cause of saving Euchronia’s slumbering prince to ensure a better future for its people. Gallica’s best moments come late in <em>Metaphor</em> as she learns surprising truths about herself and those around her. But even as things get hard, she never wavers, and is there to support the crew through their darkest moments.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-recommend-id="image://92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-recommend-id="image://92e52e9b991e3c024270ac66bbfe7b0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eupha leans against a round window in the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you meet Eupha, she has the world on her shoulders despite having seen very little of it. She’s the priestess of the mustari tribe, and she, like the rest of her people, misunderstands what that means. Initially, she believes that she must be sacrificed to a dragon in order to protect her people. This is tradition on her island, and even though there’s a big world out there, this is all she really knows. Eupha spends most of <em>Metaphor </em>trying to figure out what a “better” world even means when she has little frame of reference for what the world is now. Having an outsider around to voice their perspective can sometimes help reveal that something is all wrong, because they might see things more clearly than someone who’s been embedded in a system their whole life. Eupha delivers that. Unlike the others, she hasn’t been taught that the injustices of Euchronia simply reflect “the way things should be,” so she’s the first person to ask questions, and those questions often force everyone else to realize how ridiculous what they believe in sounds when you hear it out loud.. Eupha leaves a home she believes to be fair and just, only to discover that isn’t the rest of the world’s MO. Trying to find your place in a world that’s both new to you and also harsher than anything else you’ve experienced isn’t easy, but Eupha takes it in stride.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-recommend-id="image://040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-recommend-id="image://040703a6fc8c292eae9a5cd7ecf5c2cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basilio looks at the camera without a thought behind his eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Despite towering over him, Basilio begins <em>Metaphor </em>largely living in the shadow of his older brother Fidelio. The duo starts off as lackeys for antagonist Louis before they are betrayed by their boss, leading to Fidelio’s murder. Up until this point, Basilio has spent so long following others, whether that be his brother or his would-be king, and in one fell swoop, he loses both of his anchors. He’d already been questioning the ways of the world, but he often had to look to his brother for permission to believe what he wanted. Now that he doesn’t have to answer to anyone, he has to decide what he even wants out of this life. Basilio embodies the type of person who has spent so long being told what to do and think that they’re not sure who they are sometimes. They can hear something that sounds logical and right, but there’s always that knee-jerk reaction to look to someone for approval. When Basilio loses that, he finds out who he truly is. Sometimes tragedy is the quickest way to find out more about yourself, and then you can crawl out of the hole, born anew. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-recommend-id="image://cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-recommend-id="image://cf50f601f14ef6f97ac286789482bb92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl falls from the sky but looks content because he did some cool stuff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Strohl is your ride or die. Your first party member is a disillusioned noble who has seen how the ruling class cares little for the suffering of those beneath them. Growing up in nobility and seeing how the people are treated when their homes are destroyed is a quick path to radicalization, and Strohl’s caring, headstrong nature means he’s always willing to jump in and help someone. But that gusto means that he’s also liable to get ahead of himself. Strohl is quick to insert himself into everyone’s problems and jump ahead of the chain of command without consulting others if he thinks he knows best. He’s as subtle as a boot to the face, but that means he gets results. That’s the kind of person you want at your side while you’re fighting for change. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-recommend-id="image://2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-recommend-id="image://2bf09ad418faafdf11fc7ea9cb1bd08a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junah looks sad at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Junah could have been a one-note (no pun intended) Taylor Swift in a fantasy world archetype (sheesh, sorry, these puns came from God, not me), but her entire schtick is subversion. She’s a widely beloved musician seemingly aligned with the enemy, but then it’s revealed that she’s an undercover agent who’s been slyly working behind the scenes to help save the prince. Junah presents herself as a starlet who is the epitome of grace and showmanship, but as a nidia, she’s actually using glamor to hide her true appearance as a childlike doll. Junah is full of surprises when she could easily have fallen into a number of predictable tropes. By the time she joins the party, almost everyone on the team has been dour and dramatic at some point, so Junah’s swagger is a welcome change. But she’s not without her own drama, and her carefree attitude is never at the expense of complexity. Junah contains multitudes, both in the way she presents herself to others and in who she reveals herself to be. While the world of <em>Metaphor </em>knows her best as a songstress, it’s in the moments that she reveals who she truly is that she’s the most memorable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-recommend-id="image://17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-recommend-id="image://17daaec746c576675df9bef1d7207c42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulkenberg stands in front of a smoke cloud in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a political drama, undying loyalty to the monarchy can often be a red flag.

But her love for the prince is not blind faith, it is a trust and love that was built brick by brick, weathering the storm of political strife and standing strong against the indiscriminate passage of time. Hulkenberg’s principles endure even when she’s been given every reason to give up on herself and those around her. She sees the good in the world because she sees it in the people around her, and is willing to do anything to get a person who upholds those ideals on the throne.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-recommend-id="image://d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-recommend-id="image://d1c37790f2fb0adeef5b073dc18f30ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metaphor’s </em>thief starts out lower than the rest of the crew.

<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest program has barely just begun, and leaks are coming out left and right. It took just minutes for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-online-playtest-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first batch of information</a> to leak out from someone on social media, and now, just hours later, more has been spotted via data mining.</p>



<p>A user by the name of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sky.femboyfurry.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sky</a> began posting the information on Bluesky on Monday morning. </p>







<p>Information found includes the playtest’s codename of “Rockstock” as well as a list of what appears to be mechs or vehicles and minigames. It was also shown to be being developed by Nintendo EPD 4, which is the development group responsible for games such as 1-2-Switch, Ring Fit Adventure, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. </p>



<p>Other things discovered were the song files from the playtest, text that would fit with a character creator such as setting skin tone or body shape, and even files to suggest both PvE and PvP within the game.</p>



<p>“I would like to grant you a Beacon… However, it seems that you cannot carry any more Pieces,” one string reads. “Prepare some empty space, then return to me.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the song files, Sky uploaded what appeared to be the full soundtrack for people to download and listen to themselves.</p>



<p>Nintendo has yet to confirm any information about what the playtest program could be about. When it was first having people sign up, the company asked people not to share information about what they experience online. It’s clear that many didn’t take that request to heart. Based on the information that’s come out in the last 24 hours or so, it seems clear that it might be some sort of MMO in development at Nintendo.</p>



<p>What do you think this Nintendo Switch Online playtest program is all about? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1057/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>: Vault 13 - the ambitious mod attempting to remake Fallout 1 in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> engine - has ceased active development in order to "prioritise the well-being of project members", but it'll have the chance to live on when a build is shared with the community soon.
</p>
<p>
Fallout: Vault 13, named after the first Vault players experience in the Fallout series, has been in the works since 2021, but it started to make headlines following the release of a demo in August this year. It was to feature five open-world areas, a "completely overhauled levelling system", voice acting, plus some "tasteful, lore-friendly additions" to complement the full roster of original Fallout 1 quests and characters.
</p>
<p>
But despite the excitement generated by Fallout: Vault 13's demo, its development team has now called time on the project "due to a combination of factors". In a <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468">statement shared on social media</a>, project founder and co-lead Culinwino explained, "After much careful thought and deliberation, we have decided to officially suspend development on Fallout: Vault 1. This was not an easy decision, but we believe it is the right step at this stage of our journey".

<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848159106588418216">follow-up post</a>, Culinwino cited "burnout" and "personal life changes among core team members" as some of the reasons behind the project's cancellation. "This was an ambitious project being made with limited resources by volunteers", they noted, adding the decision to end development was made in order "to prioritise the well-being of project members". Culinwino stressed "there was no infighting or cease-and-desist from Bethesda."
</p><p>
However, while Fallout: Vault 13 will no longer be developed by its present team, the entire project as it currently exists will be released as a build on Nexus Mods "in the coming weeks". Culinwino says this will "allow the community to experience" the work completed so far and "serve as a foundation for anyone interested in continuing or building upon it in the future." Additionally, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/85307">previously released demo</a> will remain available to download.
</p>
<p>
"While this may mark the end of active development, it's not the end of our journey together," the statement concluded. "Down the line, we are planning to release a retrospective that will take a look back at everything we've accomplished with Fallout: Vault 13, celebrating the highs, the lessons learned, and the passion that drove this project... Thank you again for being a part of this incredible experience. Your support means the world to us, and I look forward to seeing where the community takes Fallout: Vault 13 from here".
</p>
<p>
Although Vault 13 has, for the time being at least, reached the end of its journey, 2024 remains a banner year for Fallout fans. Fallout 4's long-in-the-works next-gen update finally arrive this April (albeit to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">mixed reception</a>), while Amazon's acclaimed Fallout TV series has<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months"> helped bring the series to a whole new audience</a>. And in the modding world, the hugely ambitious <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> - a brand-new fan-developed game built in Fallout 4 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">has been a massive success</a>.

<p>It has been quite the past few weeks, as many big esports teams have begun to announce all their new Valorant signings while preparing for the 2025 VCT season. Among these teams is team Vitality, which just announced one of its biggest signings, Derke.</p>



<h2 id="h-derke-joins-team-vitality">Derke Joins Team Vitality</h2>



<p>It is no secret that Derke is quite the decorated player in competitive Valorant. Back in 2023, the competitor helped Evil Geniuses win the VCT 2023: Master Tokyo event and even took the stage with Team Vitality back in July of 2024 for the EMEA Stage 2, where the team came first.</p>



<p>However, Derke competed with Sentinels in the VCT Champions this year.</p>



<p>Now, the player will be joining Team Vitality for the entirety of 2025, helping to give the team one of its best years yet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Very excited to join this team with very amazing and promising players,” said Derke on Twitter when announcing his signing to Team Vitality. “Next year will be very exciting for everyone and especially for me as it’s the first time I’m having big changes like these and I’m considering it as a good challenge. The boys already felt very welcoming and really hungry to win so I’m very excited for the next season.”</p>



<p>The Finnish/Russian player will be a massive asset for the esports team going into 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-s-record">Team Vitality’s Record</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has struggled throughout the past few years with its Valorant competitive side. The team has yet to take home first place in an S-Tier Valorant tournament, with its last first place being back in 2022 VRL France: Revolution Stage 2. </p>



<p>However, that does not change the fact that the team continues to sign some of the best names in Valorant.</p>



<p><strong>Team Vitality’s current Valorant Roster:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Derke</li>



<li>Less</li>



<li>trexx</li>



<li>Sayf</li>



<li>Kicks</li>



<li>ceNder</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-season-one-will-start-november-14-promo-claims.1015596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the terms and conditions of the Little Caesars Black Ops 6 promo, it was suggested that the first season of Black Ops 6 will commence on November 14. It was referenced in a single line that has now been edited out to read ‘later this year’, suggesting that it was either real and written up too soon or written entirely in error.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-first-pass">The First Pass</h2>



<p>For the first couple of weeks of Black Ops 6, which will be released on Friday, players will be settling in and getting to grips with all the launch weapons, ‘Omnimovement’, and the many maps in the game. They’ll also be completing the campaign, as this time around, there were no pre-order bonuses that granted early access to the single-player portion of the game.</p>



<p>Little Caesars is running a promotion that can earn players in-game rewards, which is common enough for a new Call of Duty game. However, in the promotion’s terms and conditions (as spotted <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_/status/1848421146317779228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by BobNetworkUK on X</a>), there <strong>was </strong>a reference suggesting the game’s first season would go live on November 14.</p>



<p>This was screencapped by Bob.</p>



<p>If you access that link again, you’ll notice that the reference to November 14 has been removed, and it now reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Please note the Battle Pass will be delivered in-game at the start of Season 1 for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, coming later this year</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s about right, though. Typically, each new Call of Duty game has a settling-in period that is followed by the first <strong>official </strong>season, which is when the game’s first battle pass will be made ready for purchase and the rewards will start flowing. It’s also when the <strong>grind </strong>begins.</p>



<p>November 14 sounds about right – are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275996/asmongold-palestinians-racist-rant-apology-twitch-streaming-culture</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer%E2%80%99s-apology-for-racist-rant-exposes-the-rot-in-streaming-culture.1015587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275996/asmongold-palestinians-racist-rant-apology-twitch-streaming-culture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Last week, top Twitch streamer Zach Hoyt, better known as Asmongold, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/467037/asmongolds-twitch-suspension-palestine-explained">went on a racist rant against Palestinians</a>, expressing apathy for the relentless military campaign against them that has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">claimed over 40,000 lives</a>, many of them children. “I don’t give a fuck,” he said. “They’re terrible people.”</p><p>Hoyt is known for his incendiary language, but reactions to this recent outburst were enough to give him pause.&nbsp;Shortly after the stream, Hoyt <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1845982422275367189">posted an apology</a>, saying, “Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing. My bad.” Twitch suspended his channel for 14 days, and Hoyt said that he would be stepping away from leadership duties at his media company, OTK, and its subsidiaries. In <a href="https://youtu.be/RSI-N-QHNTQ?si=sXPcvJAdxxXrd3uS">a video posted to YouTube</a>, Hoyt said streaming has had a negative impact on his personality and that over the last two years, he’s been, “slowly devolving into the most mean-spirited ... rude, nasty, callous, psychopathic version of myself.”</p><p>Hoyt’s video has unintentionally shed light on a major reason that being online can feel so miserable. It’s one of the rare instances of a person with such a huge following —&nbsp;1.8 million followers on Twitch alone —&nbsp;has acknowledged that the rise of reckless, racist, homophobic, and misogynistic behavior stems from streaming culture itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Popular creators have been relying on shock and outrage to generate views for years. In 2017, at the height of his popularity on YouTube, Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg paid a pair of individuals to hold up a sign displaying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14605060/pewdiepie-disney-deal-lost-nazi-anti-semitic-imagery">a violent antisemitic phrase</a>. One year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest">Logan Paul filmed a suicide victim in Japan</a>. More recently, these kinds of behaviors have become the rule rather than the exception. And the problem has grown with the shift to live platforms like Twitch where streamers exploit — sometimes intentionally, sometimes not — outrage farming for the attention it generates.</p><p>Jack Doherty, who originally went viral for flipping markers on YouTube, was banned from Kick earlier this month after a livestream <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/462915/kick-controversy-jack-doherty-car-crash">showed him crashing his McLaren</a> because he was texting while driving. He asked his camera operator to keep filming even as he and his passengers were pulled from the wreckage covered in blood. Adin Ross gained notoriety streaming <em>NBA 2K</em>, but he’s maintained it specifically because his streams are known for hosting <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/">racists like Nick Fuentes and alleged rapists like Andrew Tate</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Andrew Tate, seen here after his arrest by Romanian authorities on charges related to human trafficking, was a frequent fixture on Adin Ross’ streams and videos.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>The platforms bear some responsibility in this. More attention means more eyeballs, so platform operators are incentivized to attract, retain, and appease streamers however they can, even if that sometimes means permitting unsavory behavior. Twitch, the biggest name in the space, takes an aggressive approach to content moderation, ostensibly to maintain the platform’s “brand-safe” image to advertisers. But there are always other platforms willing to pick up its outcasts.</p><p>When it launched in 2022, Kick became the “anti-Twitch,” appealing to creators disaffected by the site’s monetization and content policies. But while Kick has exploded in popularity, offering creators an alternative in a landscape dominated by Twitch, it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/technology/kick-streaming-twitch-gambling.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">become known for creators and content that would be banned anywhere else</a>. Last year, Paul “Ice Poseidon” Denino hired a sex worker and then briefly prevented her from leaving <a href="https://www.404media.co/kick-ice-poseidon-sex-worker-escort-stream/">when she discovered the encounter was being streamed</a>. Ross showed pornography on his stream and has, on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-car-livestream-ocean-1.7134204">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-under-fire-for-asking-fan-to-slit-brothers-throat-for-money-2076537/">occasions</a>, offered money to fans to do dangerous stunts.</p><p>Then there’s the gambling. After Twitch banned the practice, Kick — cofounded by the same people who founded casino site Stake — became the de facto home of gambling streams. It uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938853/kick-nickmercs-gambling-contract-stake">enormous multimillion-dollar contracts</a> to entice big-name creators to the site, where their audience of millions can essentially watch them develop gambling addictions in real time. Félix “xQc” Lengyel — a streamer who started his career playing in the <em>Overwatch</em> League — has become one of the most well-known gambling streamers. In 2022, he <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/streamer-xqc-admits-to-dollar2-million-in-gambling-losses-last-month-gets-told-off-by-his-dad-on-stream/">admitted he was addicted to gambling</a> after disclosing on a stream that he had lost $2 million in a single month.&nbsp;</p><p>Kick cofounder Ed Craven knows his platform attracts thrill seekers and their escalating behaviors. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/technology/kick-streaming-twitch-gambling.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">an interview with <em>The New York Times</em></a>, he said, “I think people are realizing the more controversial they are, the more shock factor involved in their content, the more viewers they get, and it can sometimes be a dangerous mix in that regard.” But while he’s said that Kick is continuously evolving its policies and the site’s terms of service prohibit the usual bad behaviors, that hasn’t stopped its streamers from <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/nmplol-disgusted-after-kick-streamer-allegedly-sexually-assaults-him-at-twitchcon-2906436/">continuing to push boundaries</a>.</p><p>And when a streamer’s actions do cross the line, what happens next? Historically, the bigger an audience a streamer has, the more reluctant a platform is to enact meaningful consequences —&nbsp;and the less leverage the platform has against them. For smaller creators, an action like a suspension can be financially significant as they rely on consistent output to maintain their partnership status or to collect donations. But a Twitch streamer like Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff, who has millions of followers and millions of dollars in subscription revenue, doesn’t have that same concern. When Kolcheff was suspended earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196">after using a slur against transgender people</a>, he <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1806640207216664777">responded on social media</a> saying that he didn’t know the word that got him banned was problematic, then made another joke at the trans community’s expense.</p><p>The most serious consequence a streamer can face for their behavior is the permanent loss of their channel, but platform incentives ensure there’s always somewhere else to go. When Herschel “Guy” Beahm, better known by his persona Dr Disrespect, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch</a> for reasons that were not initially disclosed, he continued streaming, migrating his channel — and his 4 million strong audience — to YouTube. After Ross’ eighth and <a href="https://gamerant.com/adin-ross-permanent-ban-reason-twitch/">final ban from Twitch last year</a>, he went to Kick, where he continues his controversial behavior, recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/09/some-influencers-arent-leaving-florida-despite-hurricane-milton-sparking-online-criticism/">offering to pay creators to livestream Hurricane Milton</a>. For his birthday, Craven <a href="https://gamerant.com/kick-ceo-eddie-craven-adin-ross-rolls-royce-birthday/">gifted him a Rolls-Royce</a>.</p><p>Streaming and social media reward people for being their worst selves, and it’s starting to have noticeable effects. Hateful rhetoric, like the kind Hoyt used, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/technology/twitter-hate-speech.html">on the rise</a>. External political factors like the rise of anti-LGBTQ policies, political candidates, and sentiments contribute to this. Clips of streamers espousing discriminatory views get pushed on social media, creating the kind of viral moments streamers chase. With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">resurgence of Gamergate</a> and “anti-woke” reactionaries, streamers have found that appealing to — or at least not alienating — those who agree with those subjects can lead to an audience boost. Those communities are delighted to show up in force now that their opinions are no longer relegated to the fringes of the internet but validated by its biggest voices. Reactions to Hoyt’s apology across social media featured many comments stating that he said nothing wrong.</p><div><p>Top creators <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/1/17413542/burnout-mental-health-awareness-youtube-elle-mills-el-rubius-bobby-burns-pewdiepie">are burnt out</a>. MrBeast has warned aspiring creators <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxFujx1SuGYZAJNII5hKWuxmVddMeOke0y?si=KXLPR2aO7ov4AD67">not to follow in his footsteps</a>. Though he admitted to having an addiction, xQc continues his gambling streams, possibly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/business/twitch-kick-xqc.html#:~:text=kick%2Dxqc.html-,Twitch%20Star%20xQc%20Signs%20%24100%20Million%20Deal%20With%20Kick%2C%20a,relationship%20with%20its%20top%20streamers.&amp;text=Kellen%20Browning%20reports%20on%20the%20video%20game%20industry.">because of the $100 million contract he signed with Kick</a>. Even streamers who aren’t known for being assholes have to sprinkle <a href="https://x.com/itsavibe/status/1808675839568965633">over-the-top behavior into their content</a> to keep the views flowing.</p></div><p>This makes Hoyt’s apology unique, not only because it was a rare moment of sincerity — an emotion wholly antithetical to this new streaming culture — but also because a self-admitted asshole rarely engages in the kind of reflection he did. He explained that as streaming has become his entire life, it caused him to lose valuable perspective. “There have been ways that I have acted that are indefensible,” he said. “Looking back on it, it’s just disgusting.”</p><p>But the views must flow, so there’s a limit to Hoyt’s newfound perspective. On Reddit, his post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/comment/ls8zz66/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">explaining the apology</a> contained a slur once used to describe mentally disabled people — a word that is now experiencing <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/376401/r-word-slur-return-euphemism-treadmill-cycle">a noticeable and concerning comeback</a>. His post also clarified that his apology didn’t mean he was going to totally change his behavior, only that he intends for future streams to be more positive. “Don’t worry,” he wrote. “I’ll react to a DEI=DIE gaming video first day back to stream.” The comment had over 800 upvotes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And one of those features is the addition of smoothies!</p><p>Made at any of the smoothie shops around Hyrule, Zelda can mix up some delicious drinks by combining ingredients she’s found during your travels. These smoothies—of which there are an astonishing 70—can provide you with everything from simple heart replenishment to special effects like heat and cold resistance. Below, we’ll list our favorite smoothies that we think you should keep in your flask.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After creating a smoothie for the first time, you can go to any smoothie shop and opt to pay a premium to repurchase the same drink without using the ingredients, allowing you to keep a selection of smoothies on hand even if you don’t have the necessary materials to remake them. However, this costs a <em>lot</em> of rupees, so we don’t recommend making a habit of it. Stick to using ingredients when possible.</p><p>Click on to read the best smoothies in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Tough Mango + Golden Egg</p><p>The Golden Tough Smoothie makes use of exceedingly rare Golden Eggs to create a tasty treat that not only replenishes 20 hearts but also boosts your defense for five minutes. It’s a great idea to have a few of these around—but use them sparingly against only the toughest bosses to ensure you’re not left wanting when it matters most. Making more of these can be expensive.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-recommend-id="image://8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-recommend-id="image://8ee84ff6444ab8cec57531dd091b11f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Fresh Milk + Electro Apple</p><p>Sometimes you just need quick health recovery without exhausting too many of your rare resources or rupees, and the basic Mixed Milky Smoothie will get the job done just fine. By combining two relatively common ingredients, this smoothie nets you a solid recovery of 13 hearts, so that you can stay in the fight longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-recommend-id="image://e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-recommend-id="image://e1794e7ec74b1df0dc57996b7f8a0254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Fresh Milk + Rock Salt</p><p>Replenishing your hearts is usually the main reason for slurping down a smoothie, but what if you could also get back some energy while you’re at it? That’s where the Salted Milky Smoothie comes in. This drink gives you 10 hearts while also fully filling your energy meter, so that you can whoop ass with your sword some more.

                <p>The Steam Deck will not get yearly iterations a la the iPhone, according to one of its designers, though a Steam Deck 2 will likely happen at some point.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reviews.org</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275604/dont-expect-a-new-steam-deck-to-drop-each-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said, "We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that." He elaborated that he felt it was unfair to customers to offer only incremental improvements each year. He said, "...we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck."</p><p>This answer matches prior statements Valve has made. On several occasions last year, Valve employees stated that a more powerful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-deck-2-is-still-years-away/1100-6519084/" data-ref-id="1100-6519084">Steam Deck will be years away</a>--late 2025 at the earliest. Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais explained that part of the Steam Deck brand (at least for now) is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-have-to-wait-at-least-two-years-for-a-faster-steam-deck/1100-6517933/" data-ref-id="1100-6517933">every model can play the same games</a>; Valve doesn't want to change that until Steam Deck performance gets a significant boost without losing battery life. Later in the interview, Yang did note that Valve is working on a Steam Deck successor.</p><p>The Steam Deck did get an upgrade last year in the form of the Steam Deck OLED, which improves battery life and the display quality. The Steam Deck's popularity has resulted in a variety of competitors, including the Asus ROG Ally, which got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support/1100-6525778/" data-ref-id="1100-6525778">SteamOS support in August.</a></p>

                <p>Few games have ever been in development as long as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-has-been-purchased-by-over-1-million-players/1100-6508145/" data-ref-id="1100-6508145">Star Citizen</a> has, with its 12-years-and-counting cycle. But Star Citizen's standalone spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>, comes close with 10 years since the game was announced. At this year's CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium stopped short of saying that Squadron 42 will have a definite release date in 2026. But Cloud Imperium CEO Chris Roberts did say that he was "confident" it would be released in two years.</p><p>To back up his claim, Roberts presented an hour-long gameplay demo of Squadron 42, which had a few crashes along the way. But it did show off the Wing Commander-inspired gameplay and intense sci-fi action. There are also plenty of cutscenes in the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H-0x4xk2Xk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A lot of celebrity talent has lent their voices and likenesses to the game, including Wing Commander star--and Star Wars icon--Mark Hamill, as well as Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Henry Cavill, Gillian Anderson, Mark Strong, Jack Huston, Ben Mendelsohn, and more. Cloud Imperium certainly had the budget to attract that A-list talent, since Squadron 42 and Star Citizen have raised over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$700 million in crowdfunding</a> since 2012.</p><p>Prior to CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium reportedly forced its employees into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-is-forcing-employees-to-work-seven-days-a-week-report/1100-6526879/" data-ref-id="1100-6526879">a seven-day-a-week crunch-style schedule</a> to make its deadlines for the convention. Even with that extra effort, the demo had a buggy performance, and Roberts apologized for the crashes. Squadron 42 was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squadron-42-is-now-feature-complete-after-10-years-of-development-see-new-footage-here/1100-6518577/" data-ref-id="1100-6518577">as "feature-complete" at last year's CitizenCon</a>, but clearly a lot of work remains to be done.</p><p>As for Star Citizen, Cloud Imperium's flagship title is still in alpha, with no projected release date in sight. However, Cloud Imperium did offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-now-selling-48000-bundle-that-includes-every-ship/1100-6520120/" data-ref-id="1100-6520120">a massive $48,000 bundle with every ship</a> in the game earlier this year. Hopefully someday, players will get a full game to go along with all of those ships.</p>

            <p>
It's been nearly two years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> first surfaced, immediately dazzling the world with his distinctive underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management charms, but developer Mintrocket isn't done yet; the studio has now confirmed a story expansion is on the way, and perhaps even spin-off games for each of Dave's pals.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Dave the Diver creator and director Jaeho Hwang, who shared the news with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dave-the-divers-creator-wants-to-create-a-dave-cinematic-universe-of-games/">VGC</a> during Singapore's recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia. "I want to expand Dave the Diver IP itself," he explained of the studio's future plans. "I think that's every director's dream, since we have a relatable character." Hwang (who also serves as Mintrocket's CEO) added while the base game "didn't go really deep into the personal stories in Dave the Diver, because we wanted to keep the game very casual", he wants to start filling in some of those blanks.
</p>
<p>
It seems at least some of that will happen in "the story DLC [Mintrocket is] working on right now", but Hwang said he also wants to make "separate games about each character to show how they met, what they did before coming to the Blue Hole." He noted there's some precedent for this already, albeit in reverse, given Dave the Diver character Cobra's backstory is technically told in Evil Factory, one of Hwang's earlier games.

Hwang added spin-offs focussing on different characters could give the studio a chance to explore new genres within the Dave the Diver universe, and maybe visit Dave the Diver at a time in his life he had a different profession. "He's always been a diver," he continued, "so we really haven't thought about how we should move with Dave... I really want to show how he grew up, and how he became a diver, and how he ended up coming to the Blue Hole."
</p><p>
To date, Dave the Diver - which has sold over 4m copies since launching last year - has received three bits of post-launch DLC: the Digital Extra expansion feature various cosmetics, plus a digital art book and soundtrack, as well as a free Dredge collaboration and another focused on Godzilla. Hawng offered no hint as to when Mintrocket might be done with Dave the Diver's story DLC, but it should provide the perfect excuse to revise an already stellar game.

"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is Eurogamer described Dave the Diver in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">five star review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."

		<p>Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves have announced a publishing partnership agreement today, with Bandai Namco set to publish Rebel Wolves’ first game. That game is going to be a AAA action RPG called Dawnwalker, and it is supposed to be start of a new gaming saga. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves’ Tomasz Tinc said about the agreement, <em>“Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our Wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself. We’re looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide.”</em></p>


<p>Alberto Gonzalez Lorca VP for Business Development at Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, said, <em>“This is another key milestone in our content development strategy for the Western market. By combining our strengths, we will deliver this first game of the studio to a worldwide audience. We’re excited with the universe being created by Rebel Wolves thanks to their extremely talented team of developers, resulting in a great addition to our portfolio.”</em></p>
<p>Not much is known about Dawnwalker, except that it will be set in Medieval Europe, will be an action RPG and will lean into dark fantasy. One of the things <a href="https://rebel-wolves.com/#section-services">Rebel Wolves has written on its website</a> about Dawnwalker is that it wants to give player’s more agency within games. The quote says, <em>“Our goal is to give you plenty of ways to solve a problem and then let you have a go at it. There will be no right or wrong way to play the game – it’ll be up to you to decide what is your way.”</em></p>

<p>There is currently no release date for Dawnwalker, though the confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
