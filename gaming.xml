            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sports Interactive has released a new blog post detailing some of the core&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series features that won't be in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, and if you're a fan of Create-a-Club or Touchline Shouts, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>In the post, SI studio director Miles Jacobson says that the decision to cut certain features was made based on player numbers collected from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>player data.</p>
<p>The first, and biggest, feature that will be missing from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is Touchline Shouts, which "won't be back for the foreseeable future". Jacobson says he's "never been happy" with the shout system, but that they might make a return in the future "if and when we can do them properly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-cut-features-fm24-gameplay.jpg?itok=sr5AQKTb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-cut-features-fm24-gameplay.jpg?itok=xhqV7SF4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several features from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>will be benched for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The bespoke social media screen and Data Chalkboard features will also be missing from&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>, and perhaps most devastatingly, Create-a-Club is gone as well.</p>
<p>Jacobson acknowledges that 5% of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>players used the Create-a-Club feature, but also said that this percentage "has been steadily declining", and so it'll be skipping a year while SI improves it for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>.</p>
<p>Other features and modes that won't be included in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>include Versus and Challenge (the latter of which was predominantly a console and mobile feature). The Fantasy Draft mode won't be available at launch, but will be added in a future update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-cut-features-fm24-menus.jpg?itok=q4nLH-G- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-cut-features-fm24-menus.jpg?itok=lWp3eCBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24</em>'s menus could use some work, you're in luck.</figcaption></figure><p>Happily, it's not all about cut features.&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24</em>'s menus are getting an overhaul in&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>, with the new menus using something SI is calling a "tile and card" system.</p>
<p>The system will display tiles of information that have multiple different states, while cards contain more information that elaborates on what you're looking at in tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of other major UI and UX changes are also coming in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, alongside the series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">first partnership with the Premier League</a> and more. It's well worth reading <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacobson and SI's full post</a> for the complete lowdown.</p>
<p>We don't have a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date yet, but Jacobson says Sports Interactive and Sega will reveal the date in early September. Stay tuned for that and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-which-also-gets-nvidia-dlss-3-5.913083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 556.12) optimized for The First Descendant, the upcoming free-to-play third-person looter shooter game developed by NEXON.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered title will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction, ray tracing, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HDR10+</a> when it launches on July 2. Here's an excerpt from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-summer-game-fest-impressions-let-the-loot-rain-fall-on-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent hands-on at Summer Game Fest 2024</a>:</p>
<p><em>The First Descendant is a very mobile type of third-person shooter. Staying grounded in one spot and even strafing from side to side won't prevent players from catching a stray bullet to the face. Instead, adding in jumps and a sleek grappling hook helps the player bounce around the battlefield and circle to the backside of an oversized boss and escape attacks coming their way. Having the grappling hook set to the middle mouse button took some getting used to, but with a very short cooldown and a generous range, I could unload a full clip into the boss' weak point, grapple onto a nearby pillar, and hide behind it as cover while I reload. Gunplay is quick and snappy in The First Descendant and would be the main draw as a casual non-IAP, or truly free-to-play, player.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant | RTX On Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrO58UTTVis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The GeForce Game Ready driver also brings optimization for a few games that have added NVIDIA DLSS support, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAYDAY 3</a> (now with integrated DLSS Frame Generation, which doubles performance for owners of RTX 40 GPUs), Tribes 3: Rivals (which added DLSS Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex in a patch released earlier this month), and Riven. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/riven-unreal-engine-5-remake-to-launch-this-year-on-pc-with-vr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake</a> of the beloved adventure game originally released in 1997 is out now and supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As usual, the Game Ready driver adds one-click optimal settings for a few more games and fixes a few bugs. You can find those details below, straight <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/556.12/556.12-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the official changelog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Optimal settings via the NVIDIA app or GeForce Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bodycam</li>
<li>EA SPORTS F1 24</li>
<li>Pax Dei</li>
<li>Soulmask</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Gaming Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[The Last of Us Part 1] Out of memory error with 555.xx drivers</li>
<li>[Halo Infinite] Crashing during initial loading screen with 555.99 driver</li>
<li>[Valorant] In-game statistics incorrectly shows high latency with 555.xx drivers</li>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1806137312830800334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent post</a> on X, Capcom announced that a new Capcom Next summer showcase event is coming on July 1, 2024, beginning at 3 PM PDT.</p>



<p>The event will run for 25 minutes, “sharing info on 3 titles.” That will include the first details on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom just revealed</a> this week.</p>



<p>The other two featured titles are Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and the Resident Evil 7 Biohazard port for iOS and Mac.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a corresponding <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/next/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog</a>, Capcom elaborates on the showcase’s content. Capcom confirms that the event “will not include any updates on Monster Hunter Wilds.” </p>



<p>The event’s description on YouTube via the premiere feature broadens this. It states the event will not include “news or updates for other Capcom titles.” So, fans may not expect any surprises akin to larger showcases.</p>



<p>Capcom recently announced Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster with a release window for 2024. It could potentially get a smaller window or exact date for Capcom Next. </p>



<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is due out on July 19, 2024, for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. </p>



<p>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard will get its new versions on July 2, 2024. The original Resident Evil titles are also joining GOG, with the first title available now via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-resident-evil-joins-gog-sequels-coming-later-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new bundle</a>. Resident Evil 2 and 3 will release on GOG sometime in 2024, too.</p>

            <p>Often, one of the biggest problems in game development is knowing what you are meant to be creating.</p>
<p>Organisational psychologist and Team Sync founder Graham McAllister has been grappling with how to identify and solve this issue in recent years, inspired by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bioware-acknowledges-workplace-production-problems-report">Jason Schreier's article on the troubled development of Anthem for Kotaku</a>.</p>

<p>But the problem is not unique to that game. To pick one recent example, Creative Assembly's now-cancelled Hyenas <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cancelled-hyenas-was-segas-biggest-budget-game-ever-its-claimed/">is reported to have had a budget of around $100 million</a>, but developers who worked on the project – speaking anonymously – have said that the game's vision was unclear for much of the seven years it was in the works.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> boss Christopher Dring for GI Sprint, McAllister explains why aligning on a vision can be immensely challenging and also details ways that developers can overcome this problem.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">Why communicating ideas is hard</h2>
<p>The biggest problem when it comes to the early stages of game development, McAllister explains, is how you communicate what the vision for the project actually is. What is shared and interpreted by another person is often incomplete, lacking vital information and, as it is shared across a development team, deviates further and further from the initial vision.</p>
<p>Thanks to this incomplete idea, every single person can have a slightly different mental model of the game vision as they are different people with different experiences.</p>
<p>"The chance of that vision being created by everything interpreted the same way by every single person is very, very unlikely," McAllister says.</p>
<p>This problem is exacerbated by the language used to communicate an idea. There is conceptual language – high-level, ambiguous, and hard to interpret – and concrete language – specific, often referencing features a game has, while lacking how it is to play on a human level.</p>
<p>The third issue with communication is one specific to the games industry: how it feels to experience the final product. McAllister says developers often find it very difficult to describe the feeling of a game or how an experience is meant to make the player feel.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">It's vital to be aligned at the start of production</h2>
<p>McAllister says that teams must ensure that they have nailed the vision right at the start of production. His research – and reading work from the field of management science – shows that everyone has to know what they are meant to be making, or risk wasting time and money further down the line.</p>
<p>"70% of the costs for a project are tied back to decisions made at the concept stage," he explains.</p>
<p>"But [the research] doesn’t say that 70% of the costs are spent in concept. What it says is that the decisions that are made during the concept impact 70% of the total cost you will spend later on, such as the size of the team and the scope of the game. You're making all those decisions at the concept stage; what are we making? What size of the project? How much do we spend on marketing?</p>
<p>"If you get that wrong, you will rebuild that later on. Again, we look at how much it costs you to redo something later in development; it's about five-to-15 times the cost you originally thought, plus more time."</p>
<p>Often, developers fall into the trap of thinking that they can just work hard on an imperfect vision and it’ll figure itself out later down the line. The truth is you’re just going to end up redoing much of this work – there’s no point in running quickly if you are travelling in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>"I hear a lot that: 'We're too busy, we just have to go and make the game'," McAllister said.</p>
<p>"But, if you're just going faster but going in different directions, you're making things worse. That will have to be undone at some stage and done again. Some people like identity, and some people think that if they have had success in the past, they know what they're doing. They find they have to tell their team that they don't know what they're doing, which reflects badly on them. They don't want to deal with that so they want to appear confident and just say 'We're going this direction'."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Poor communication has a human cost</h2>
<p>Not all the costs involved can be measured purely in dollars. If someone is being asked to redo work because there was a lack of direction, or having to work overtime to meet a deadline due to wasted time, there is a human cost involved.</p>
<p>"[You can] burn through the goodwill of staff," McAllister says. "They're now demotivated. They'll say: 'We have to do it again' or 'We told you this was going to be a problem and you didn't listen'. When I was interviewing game developers about how they manage their game's vision, they said that because we're misaligned, people are experiencing friction, burnout, and erosion of trust. </p>
<p>"It has led to project cancellations. This is not just a technical thing – wasting time and money – this is essentially ruining the culture of the studio and ruining people's lives. People are unnecessarily experiencing conflict because they don't know what we're making and they're butting heads against each other to try and correct the problem.</p>
<p>"It's directly tied to the time you take, the amount of money you spend, the creativity of a project and the psychology of the culture of that team and studio… All of these things are directly linked back to that one single root cause. That's why all the evidence says this is the most important thing to a successful team, because it impacts nearly everything that a team does."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Know if you are not aligned on the vision for a project</h2>
<p>If you want to create a good game quickly, it's essential that everyone involved with its creation knows what the vision for the project is. To this end, McAllister has spent years creating something called the 'Vision Alignment Check', which does what it says on the tin – ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to what they are creating.</p>
<p>He has also created a list of "potential signs that your team might be misaligned."</p>
<p>"The first one on this list is: 'I feel we are taking longer than expected to find the vision'," McAllister explained. "Time by itself is not the solution. Other items include if there are repeating discussions with minimal progress around which features should be in or out of the game. So if you're spending time and concept, but you feel you're making progress, that's fine. But if you feel you're in an endless cycle, then that's unhealthy.”</p>
<p>The last sign that you are not aligned as a team during the concept phase is that everyone involved does not understand the field of vision for the game well. This includes stakeholders or other partners external to the development team.</p>
<p>"So if you're in co-development, for example, or you've got a publisher, is the vision understood equally by everyone on the team or parts of the team? This is a team sport that we're participating in."</p>
<blockquote>"The chance of that vision being created by everything interpreted the same way by every single person is very, very unlikely"

</blockquote>
<p>The team spirit also applies to your studio itself: you should feel comfortable challenging leadership if you feel like you're not aligned on the vision or you don't quite know the game you're making.</p>
<p>"I know this is difficult, but you need to challenge if you think you're not aligned on the vision of the game," McAllister says.</p>
<p>"This is a leadership problem. You need to have a culture where it’s completely okay – or better yet, encouraged, to say that you do not know what the game you are making is.”</p>
<p>He continues: "People might not feel comfortable speaking up in the studio if they’re quite new, and the company has hired some famous designer who's world experienced and has been in the industry for 20 years and has a load of successful games… Are you going to tell them that you have no idea what they are talking about? You should, but that's very difficult. Then we’re getting into the culture of the studio. They may say things that they encourage you to speak up; that’s easy to say, but really hard to do."</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Stop and play your game as a team</h2>
<p>One way to make it clear what the vision for your game is simply to play it. McAllister cites the development of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where staff working on the title would frequently play the game together.</p>
<p>This meant that everyone knew what they were working on and resulted in staff being much more efficient in what they were doing.</p>
<p>"[Nintendo was] trying to make Zelda: Breath of the Wild and they had to borrow 100 extra team members from another department to help finish the game in time for the Switch's launch," McAllister says.</p>
<blockquote>"The evidence says you shouldn’t be working in your own little silo. You need to build up a team mental model"</blockquote>
<p>"They said that the natural thing would have been to say they were busy, just work faster and work harder. But when they brought these 100 extra people onto the team, they stopped and played the game every few days to share knowledge. I think they called it 'horizontal information sharing' –  there are lots of psychology studies that say this works. Knowledge sharing is one of your greatest assets. It's also called 'team mental models'. The more I know you and the more you know me, the better that team gets."</p>
<p>Whereas being aligned on a vision for a game is called a task mental model, a team mental model is all about how you are performing as a group to reach your end goals.</p>
<p>"For example, [if] I know you work in art and I'm working on something that I think might affect you, I will give you a heads up that this may impact you, so you work more efficiently.  If you don't know what your team members are working on, and how they work on their problems, the knowledge isn't flowing around the company. The evidence says you shouldn’t be working in your own little silo. You need to build up a team mental model."</p>
<p>This doesn’t just apply to development-specific roles; everyone involved in the project's creation – such as those on business side of things – should be involved in playing the game together.</p>
<p>"Art sits beside programming, production, QA, the CEO, marketing, and so on,” McAllister says. "They're all looking at the same thing and saying: ‘Oh, that's the game you're making'."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the chilly city-builder now set to arrive in September to give the devs time to respond to user feedback collected during the recent beta period.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>&nbsp;directors&nbsp;Jakub Stokalski and Łukasz Juszczyk say that the user feedback from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-system-requirements-beta">the game's beta</a> contained "many keen observations on areas we could improve or add to the final game".</p>
<p>The pair say that in order to do justice to the information gleaned from the beta, more development time is needed, which is why the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>release date is September 20th, representing a delay of about two months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-city.jpg?itok=MynrmNhN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-city.jpg?itok=ltT3SD2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time to cook (or should that be thaw?).</figcaption></figure><p>To placate disappointed fans, 11 bit goes into some detail regarding what's changed and what will be included in the game owing to the extra development time.</p>
<p>Several game mechanics have been tweaked to ensure a smoother&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>experience, including temperature and heat, workforce management, and the addition of a brand new resource, plus more.</p>
<p>The game's UI and UX have been enhanced in an "extensive" fashion; it'll now have a clearer HUD, a new construction menu, and more clarity and readability when it comes to the Idea Tree.</p>
<p>Another new enhancement, Zoom Stories, allows you to zoom in on your citizens and follow their individual lives, seeing what they're up to so that you can feel more connected to the lives of those who live in your city.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=fU7mM3j- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=0YdoItKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new features will be added to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>as a result of the additional development time.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is the followup to 11 bit's popular 2018 city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with building and maintaining a settlement in the midst of a harsh post-apocalyptic winter. You'll have to scavenge for supplies, manage resources and citizens, and make difficult moral decisions that will have a lasting impact on your city.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>when it arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008442/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/frostpunk-2/9PN2K1LQN94D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 20th.

            <p>When the ageing, silent character you play in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selfloss">Selfloss</a> performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086620/Selfloss/">Steam demo</a> just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.</p>

<p>After chatting to a long man, reminiscent of a stretched, ghostly goose, I reach the crest of a bright hill, and meet a very large woman with fish earrings, who points toward a stony, somewhat desolate island atop which sits a ruined fort. I climb down the cliff face, hop in a wooden boat, and off I go.</p>
<p>There’s a web-like purple mucus plant blocking my way to the island. To get rid of it, I have to shine my light staff at some globules. At the ruins, I meet my first hostile creatures: lumbering meatball folk, who you deal with using the staff’s light beam. They go down easy, but there’s still something chunkily tasty about the haptic buildup (I’m using a Dualsense) and sound swell, culminating in a popped-spot crescendo.</p>

<p>I do reckon that if you’re not using a controller, you’ll miss out on a lot of what’s great in Selfloss’s moment-to-moment. Just moving around is imbued with weight and presence and all those other words that mean “pad shake make game feel real.” There’s a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a> about it, both in the genre sense and how much is communicated through the controls. The staff can be a little tricky to line up with the fleshy nobules you need to burst to navigate the place, but the simple act of aiming it using the analogue stick feels very natural, and you can even plonk the staff down to shine at yourself, washing off any poison goop you might have got over you during traversal.</p>
<p>I shine my staff at a totem, unlock a bridge, cross it, and ungunk a whale so it may return to the sky. Next meet a big man in a hut, and learn I’m in a place called Leeway - a sort of purgatory for those not yet ready to die. The big lady I met earlier is named Marena, and she runs things here. Sometimes, she imprisons people for years to do her bidding until they’re ready to, quote, take on the form of a fish to ascend. Ah, so the big whale I freed was a trapped soul? So many mysteries, most of them fish related.</p>

<p>I exit the hut through the back, which sends me tumbling through space. After a cryptic message about orcas, I find myself in a garden. Inside another hut, I find a note that explains what “Selfloss” means - its a ritual meant to “heal the wounds of someone who has lost a loved one”. To perform it, I’ll need an item of personal value and “the essence of the Loss fish.” I’m actually really into all this, despite the fact I can’t stop laughing at the idea of a.) a fish trying to emote the concept of bereavement and b.) the mental image of several fish arranged on a beach like ‘<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss">Loss</a>’.</p>
<p>I grab a backpack, a hat, and a sickle, hope in another boat, and it’s off to more adventure. I hope there’s fish and bet there will be, but I’m also very into Selfloss’s quite singular melancholic tone, and how it contrasts with what’s a fairly easy-going experience so far. Something you could play when you’re physically exhausted, and perhaps want to get spirituality exhausted too. Still, there’s undoubtedly some loveliness nestled underneath all the meatball demons and gunk. It’s got its fishhooks in me for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-remaster-comparison/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the first Dead Rising Remaster comparison videos has been released, comparing 2006's Dead Rising to the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>
<p>Totally out of the blue, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a 'remaster' of 2006's Dead Rising yesterday in the form of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Going by the announcement trailer, however, we're looking more at a remake of the 2006 game as the visual upgrades are quite major, and the game's main protagonist has seemingly underwent some kind of makeover.</p>
<p>Following the announcement trailer, YouTube channel '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMt2Sn7mXo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>' released a comparison video, which clearly shows the vastly improved visuals. Then ago, it also shows how Frank West&nbsp; has been waiting for this remaster and aged around 20 to 30 years. Going by the comments under the video, fans of the game clearly aren't happy with the "new" Frank in the remaster. Check out the comparison video below and tell us what you think.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster | Original vs Remaster | Teaser Trailer Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSMt2Sn7mXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slating a release on the "new generation" platforms sometime later this year. Likely, we're looking at a PS5 and Xbox Series X\S release, and hopefully, PC as well. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the game.</p>
<p>We've included some details about the 2006 version of the game below (from the official press release back then):</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising features an open level of freedom and offers a vast array of gameplay possibilities. As part of a real time system, time is dynamic in Dead Rising, marching on whether Frank is actively engaged or if simply stationary. Time also plays a role as zombies become more powerful when the sun goes down. Though they move slowly during the day, the zombies become stronger and faster at night, making it even more dangerous for players to survive. The unprecedented numbers of enemies come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population of former humans that have retained some memory of their previous lives, which is reflected in their behaviour and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall offers players an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons and more. Players will also encounter other survivors along the way and by helping them can acquire valuable clues as to what has happened.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186582/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-torrent-scared<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="uxLfg9">There is nothing better than a trusty steed. Every adventurer needs a creature who can ride into the depths of hell and back and serve as a constant source of support throughout the trials and tribulations of becoming a hero. But as the new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>DLC reminds us, every creature has its limits. And now even Torrent — the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957071/elden-ring-torrent-ultimate-horse-companion">ride-or-die horsey of the Tarnished</a> — can’t take it anymore, and he won’t be summoned in a particular region of the game. </p>
<p id="ZupqqN">FromSoftware released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> on June 21. The extensive expansion adds loads of new super-tough boss fights, enemies, and new regions to explore. One of such spots includes the Abyssal Woods, a hazy forrest imbued with darkness at every turn. It turns the creepy dial way up and apparently, it’s too much for poor old Torrent. If you walk into the woods while riding the mount, your ghost horse will disappear and the game flashes the following text: “The spectral steed is frightened and cannot be summoned.” In other words, Torrent won’t let you ride him in the ominous woods. </p>

<p id="S3TEEV">The moment took many players by surprise. Just a single clip of Torrent disappearing got more than 211,000 views on TikTok. The is the same summon who was willing to face all the evils of the base game with you — there’s a literal <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">lord of blood</a> who looks like a beast from hell. The most-liked reply the viral video above said, “how is the horse scared of this but bro looks at elden beast with 0 fears.”</p>
<p id="YOBqae">Look, I don’t get it, but I won’t judge. Maybe Torrent wanted to leave before, but he just didn’t work up the guts. The entire woods is basically like the horror section of <em>Erdtree,</em> and it would be a lot easier if Torrent were there to race players past the creepy, skulking Aged Ones. Regardless, it looks like the Tarnished will have to figure out this challenge on their own. </p>
<p id="S4gcFO"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is available to play on PlayStation 5 and Windows PC. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1806266817972699510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Frostpunk 2 team announced that the game’s anticipated release is now delayed until September 20, 2024.</p>



<p>During the Xbox partner preview showcase last March, Frostpunk 2 previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-july-release-date-announced-at-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got a release date</a> for July 25, 2024. However, the devs offered a lengthy explanation for their decision.</p>



<p>In today’s post, the team cites a combination of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-gets-beta-and-new-gameplay-deep-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent Beta’s</a> feedback, and “the existing backlog of features.” Fans quickly supported the decision, dedication, and communication of the team. </p>



<p>The devs added that “we believe that these additional features are something you deserve to see in-game from day one, not in a patch added after the release.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just over two months ago, you had the chance to play the Beta, and we greatly appreciate the feedback you shared with us. Your observations, along with the existing backlog of features that we were already working on, made us realize that we can prioritize things better to… <a href="https://t.co/iTMG3853DG">pic.twitter.com/iTMG3853DG</a></p>— Frostpunk 2 (@frostpunkgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/frostpunkgame/status/1806266817972699510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a corresponding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Steam</a>, the developers also specified which features they plan to improve. </p>



<p>That includes key gameplay changes affecting temperature, workforce management, direct-use abilities, protest mechanics, and even a new resource. There will also be improved UI and UX, such as the HUD and easy visibility. </p>



<p>Lastly, the devs explained that Frostpunk 2 will now get a “Zoom Stories” feature. This allows players to zoom in and watch citizens’ everyday life.</p>



<p>The Steam post says that “we’ve only mentioned a fraction of it,” so there will be other improvements before launch.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it releases in September 2024.</p>

Having beaten the DLC during the review window, I absolutely agree that FromSoftware is trying to do different things with Shadow of the Erdtree, making players think differently when it comes to challenging bosses.</p><p>I changed my build and I re-spec’d my character multiple times during my playthrough, and in the back of my mind I kept thinking, “maybe I’ll have to hold off beating the DLC until it launches and I can get some help with fighting [Redacted].”</p><p>In the end I did finish the DLC before the review embargo went up, but instead of jumping to start a new game, I’ve been camping around some of the bosses I had the most trouble with during my time beating the game — mainly Rellana, the Twin Knight, and Messmer the Impaler — to leave behind my summon sign and help new players on their quest through the Elden Ring DLC. It’s a lesson I learned from a dear friend of mine, Solaire, the jolly co-operator from the very first Dark Souls game whose incandescent aura was meant to teach players that co-op in Dark Souls isn’t just a tool, but a divine calling.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/03/09/solaire-switch-1520621950357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>I miss you, man.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The frequency in which I’m getting called in to help someone fight a boss, I think, proves how little issue most players have with summoning online players to help. And one of my close friends playing the DLC now is trying to do so without any summons at all, NPC or otherwise, for their first playthrough which is also a valid way to play. But to anyone saying that summoning an online player or even an NPC to help with a boss is somehow “cheating” is ridiculous, and furthermore, plain wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If online co-op is such a shameful thing in a FromSoftware game, why introduce it in Dark Souls through one of the best characters to ever grace a Souls game?</p></div><p>The hardliners calling for there to be only one “right” way of playing a FromSoftware game — without NPC or online co-op — can’t be easily dismissed. I’ve seen enough comments online from new players struggling with a boss but too scared to ask for any kind of help because they believe it’s wrong, when in fact it is a part of the FromSoftware experience woven into the genre itself.</p><p>To return back to Solaire, if online co-op were such a shameful thing in a FromSoftware game, why introduce it in Dark Souls through one of the best characters to ever grace a Souls game? The knight Solaire and his willingness to help players defeat the game’s toughest bosses is one of the earliest and most enduring memes to come out of Dark Souls, but shouldn’t overshadow his lesson of cooperating with others to overcome great challenges.</p><p>But more than that, co-op in any FromSoftware game is a new dimension to the experience. Playing with others against particularly hard bosses, especially on higher New Game Plus difficulties, is no walk in the park, and there’s a dread of seeing your summoned partner die part way through the fight. Or on the flip-side, overpowering a boss with a partner, unleashing chaotic combos and massive damage is an experience that’s too rare in a FromSoftware game too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There’s also the learning aspect of co-op. Even if your party ends up wiping against a boss, you might learn a new tactic or strategy from your summoned partner that you can then take into the boss by yourself, learning from an online stranger like an apprentice learns from a mysterious master.</p><p>Miyazaki is adamant about several things, that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-making-elden-ring-easier-would-break-the-game-as-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launches">making Elden Ring easier would ruin the game</a>, and that FromSoftware is a studio that enjoys designing challenging and difficult games. But as FromSoft fans also know, nothing the team does is ever done without reason, and that is precisely why co-op and summons have been a mainstay in every FromSoftware SoulsLike since Demon’s Souls. It is as much a part of FromSoftware’s DNA as a poison swamp.</p><p>I believe the guiding philosophy of FromSoftware when it comes to difficulty is that all the tools to beat one of its games are readily available. It’s all a matter of how you want to go about it. If you’re finding yourself coming close to beating a boss but not making it over the final third of its health bar, maybe a few more hours of grinding for levels will help. If you find that the weapon you used for most of your game is suddenly coming up short, there’s likely a stronger version of your favorite weapon hiding somewhere nearby. There are also <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring">plenty of guides online</a> you can use.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It is as much a part of FromSoftware’s DNA as a poison swamp.</p></div><p>And if you’ve exhausted all the options above, there’s no reason you can’t look around for a golden summon sign to call on a little help from an unknown friend online. Think back to the early days of Elden Ring when the hardest boss in the game was Malenia, Blade of Miquella. FromSoftware often makes some of its games’ hardest bosses optional and there’s a chance that if Malenia was mandatory, many people would never have finished the game. Thankfully, a naked, pot-headed warrior named ‘LetMeSoloHer’ ushered many a player to the promised land (beating Malenia).</p><p>Ultimately, the FromSoftware community is a joyous and collaborative one at its core. Reddits house lore hounds who share secrets freely with one another, trading theories on different character backstories. Build guides are made so players can learn how to create their perfect characters, and nothing beats summoning a partner, trading the customary gesture like the bow or wave, and heading into the fog gate together.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/retrospective-a-producer-s-guide-to-team-buy-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Pexels user fauxels.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Intro">Intro</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game producer facilitates an efficient work environment by assigning tasks, clearing blockers, and planning schedules. However, all this work can fall by the wayside if the team isn’t invested in the vision of the game. But, in an industry full of creative and passionate minds, how do you get everyone’s interests aligned? The answer varies from team-to-team, there is no one way to establish a strong team culture, and that’s the fun of it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Below, I reflect on my experience leading production on a 47-person carnival themed arcade racing game named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fastival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. More specifically, on three ways in which my team modified the physical space of a studio to increase team morale and productivity.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Room Layout">Room Layout</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One challenge when discussing room layout (in the context of game development) is the need to balance collaboration and distraction. How do you create a space in which people can easily work with one another, but not get in each other’s way? This question was on the top of my mind when it came time to restructure our studio’s space. Like a mad chemist, I spent a lot of time considering various special compositions. Who would work best with each other? What departments needed to be near one another? Which developers were the most talkative, which were quiet? Finally, I decided on a layout (pictured below) and proudly unveiled it to the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The three Track teams each had their own table in the center of the room. I placed them in the middle of the space because the track team was essentially the glue pulling the artist and programmers together. I placed the Race Logic team, who worked on lap counters and player positions with the UI team, so that the UI team could have assistance in getting their blueprints hooked up to art assets. I could go on and on, but you get the point- it made sense, it was efficient, it fit the team, or so I thought. This ended up being the worst milestone the team experienced throughout the game’s development. While this room layout is not the sole reason for the disappointing milestone, I knew something needed to change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so, moving into the next sprint (Alpha), I dusted off my Photoshop skills and tried my hand rearranging the room- again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key driving difference between the first layout and this new one was the focus on the team’s wants and needs. The three Track teams did not enjoy making tracks on an “island” – isolated away from other track designers. The designers enjoyed playtesting and comparing ideas with one another, so I placed the teams right next to each other. At Alpha, the artists had started to shift from proxies to textured assets, the look of the game was taking shape. Consequently, I moved the artists to the middle of the room where the whole team could walk by and admire the game’s visual progress. Did the physics team need to walk a bit further to talk to the track designers? Absolutely- but it didn't matter because the designers were happier (and as a result, productive) in their new location.&nbsp;The new layout paid off. The Alpha milestone was our most successful milestone and proved to be instrumental in us getting greenlit to publish on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, it would be extremely naïve and arrogant to say my swapping of a few tables fixed every issue we had previously encountered. It definitely didn’t. Although, in the fast-paced atmosphere that is game development every bit of productivity counts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought I had created the lean-mean productivity machine in my first layout. However, by gaining a pulse on the team, and being willing to adapt to their needs, we came up with a new solution that wasn’t as productive at face value, but ultimately saw the most success. The mutually beneficial space we created not only made work more fun but built a foundation of trust that aligned the team’s goals for the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Decorate">Decorate</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another great way to enhance physical space is to fill it with decorations to celebrate the team’s progress. This is a very practical yet often overlooked step. The team and I were so busy with other priorities that we let this slip. The room was empty and stagnant. This atmosphere bled into the team culture as our studio became a place where we just “clocked-in, clocked-out” rather than a space where we were creating something fun. This became even more of an issue when considering we were creating a vibrant and energetic carnival themed game. Our own studio did not reflect the product we were creating, and as a result members of the team began to lose faith in the game. Realizing this needed to change, I took it upon myself to make a trip to Party City. I’ll be honest, I was pessimistic. The idea of decorating seemed juvenile, especially given the carnival theme. Nonetheless, I found some party flags, banners and streamers, and with some help from teammates decorated the studio before the team came in the next day. I was shocked how such a small change made such a big difference. People lit up when they entered the studio for the first time. Suddenly the room itself was an embodiment of the game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fastival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I played videos of various carnivals from around the world on the screens in the studio, it felt like we were in a completely new space. This decorative pass brought a second wind of energy to the team and played perfectly with the lighthearted spirit we were replicating in our game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Projecting Progress">Projecting Progress</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This doesn’t apply to just decorations, however. As we got closer to our Launch deadline and the work was waning, so was the energy of the team. This was a delicate situation to navigate as we needed to make a final push to get our game across the finish line, however the last thing I wanted to do was create a crunch culture and tarnish the team dynamic in the final moments. As lead producer I knew the tasks that needed to be done to get our game to the best quality possible, but I wanted to present those tasks in an engaging way. In response, I created a swim lane chart listing the high-level priorities. I projected this chart onto several walls around the studio. The chart was a living document, so as tasks were completed, I could move them through the various stages of production.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chart served as a physical marker of progress, and a reminder that their hard work was contributing to the success of the game. To prevent this chart from becoming a stress inducer, and encouraging crunch, we gamified the process. Every time a task was moved from “In-Progress” to “Complete”, I would announce it, move the task on the screen, and the whole team watched and celebrated the accomplishments.&nbsp; It was a small thing but making it a part of the studio environment not only focused the team on the highest priority items, but also gave them something tangible to rally behind. This all culminated in a great moment when on the final day of development, we were left with 0 remaining “To-Do” and “In-Progress” tasks. The collective joy shared by the team in that moment will stay with me for a long time.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no one way to cultivate a cohesive team and generate buy-in. Hopefully this blog gave insight into very small things you as a producer can do to break up the monotony, engage the team, and make a space in which people enjoy coming to work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The highlight of this show, however, will surely be the first look at Capcom's Dead Rising remaster, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-slapstick-zombie-mall-adventure-dead-rising-is-being-remastered">announced quite out of the blue last night</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/next/en-us/">showcase</a> will air at 11pm UK time on 1st July, across Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/capcomusa/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@capcom">TikTok</a> platforms. It will not include any updates on Monster Hunter Wilds, the studio has said.</p>
<p>As for that Dead Rising remaster, the studio has billed it as "an updated release with a brand new look", and coming to "newest generation of platforms". Capcom is yet to share a launch date for the upcoming release, but perhaps we will find this out next week.</p>
<p>Eurogamer rather liked Dead Rising when the game made its original debut all the way back in 2006.</p>
<p>"It may not be licensed by George A. Romero," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-deadrising-x360">wrote Tom Bramwell at the time</a>, "but it was certainly inspired by him, and it replicates a lot of the feelings he inspired in the viewer. And as I plunge yet another sickle into someone's neck and jerk their head off with my foot, showering myself in blood, I can't help but think that he'd rather approve of it."</p>
<p>
Hopefully this remaster will evoke a similar sentiment.</p> <div>

<p>We were introduced to an exciting Zelda game during this month’s Nintendo Direct. For the first time in the franchise’s history, players will step into the shoes of Princess Zelda, offering a fresh and unique perspective. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 26, 2024</a>, and is now available for pre-order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested players can pre-order The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Store</a> or other retailers such as <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom--nintendo-switch/411895.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch/6509219.p?skuId=6509219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. The base game will cost $59.99, with no pre-order bonuses or special editions available. This means you won’t miss out on anything if you decide to pick up the game on release day.&nbsp;But, if you want to play the game on launch day, pre-ordering is the way to go, as the stocks might end up being sold out at certain retailers. Players will also have the option to redeem Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers while pre-ordering from the Nintendo Store.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will follow a similar art style as The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Zelda has been tasked with helping people who are being kidnapped through strange rifts. Among the kidnapped is a certain swordsman she needs to find, too. Zelda and her companion, fairy Tri, must use the Tri Rod to create Echoes to overcome all obstacles. Echoes are the new gameplay feature that can imitate objects in the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Echoes can be water blocks, old beds or even rocks; players must find all types of echoes and understand how they can be used to get around Hyrule. With the help of these imitations, you will need to solve puzzles and defeat enemies that come your way. As with all the Zelda titles, there will be a lot of creative freedom as players can think up their combinations with all types of varying Echoes to get further in the story.&nbsp;</p>

But we also realized that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of <em>Frostpunk 2</em>.

These ogres were known to cause no end of problems for the humans they came upon, leading them to be feared and hated, regarded as monsters and demons.</p><p>One day, a trio of soon-to-be folk heroes named Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro decided enough was enough, and set foot upon the land from whence the ogres came: Onigashima. Their goal was to confront the ogres on their own turf and take them down once and for all… and so they did.</p><p>After a long struggle, Momotaro and his crew successfully defeated the leader of the ogres: the beautiful yet dreaded Iroha (CV: Yukari Tamura). And with Iroha’s defeat, the ogres themselves fell to ruin, and peace once again reigned for humanity. Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro were heralded as heroes, and they all lived happily ever after…</p><p>Or did they?!</p><p>Tokyo, present day.</p><p>Iroha, having used an ancient technique for reincarnation upon herself just moments before her demise, has lived many lives in many forms. Finally, after nearly giving up hope, she discovers the last surviving ogres: a trio of sisters bearing the name of their ancient homeland, Onigashima. She (or, now, he, as a male cat) raises them as her/his own, strictly teaching them the ways of the sword so that one day, s/he may lead them into battle against Momotaro and reclaim the ogres’ rightful place in society.</p><p>And fortunately for them, Momotaro is indeed still out there! Specifically, a guy named Momotaro—who happens to be a 37th generation descendant of the original—just so happens to have been toiling day in and day out as a host in the red light district, and has finally reached his breaking point. He has PLANS now, and suffice it to say, they’re not exactly folk-heroic!</p><p>So, hey, this was supposed to just be a petty revenge story, but with Momotaro suddenly turning evil due to systemic depression, maybe the ogres can actually be the good guys this time around! Lucky… them, I guess?</p><p>What even IS this story, anyway?!</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Ran</strong> (voiced by Yoko Hikasa) – The middle sister. Always has a sword at the ready. Innately controls fire, so many of her techniques are fire-related. More of a doer than a thinker, Ran is the type who will hit first and ask questions later. Comes across as stoic but reliable.</li><li><strong>Hana</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Takeishi) – The eldest sister. Armed with a whip and a longbow. Don’t let her gentle voice and calm-seeming personality fool you: she’s 100 percent sadist. If you cross a line with her, she’ll mess you right up. Generally serious and confident, she’s nonetheless the voice of reason among the three.</li><li><strong>Yume</strong> (voiced by Hina Kino) – The youngest sister. <a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a>ly flaunts her metal club, but also has bombs at the ready. Does not think things through, ever. She acts purely on instinct at all times. Educated through games and anime rather than textbooks, with expected results. Lures you in with her cuteness, but then absolutely demolishes you with words and weapons alike as you approach. Most definitely hazardous to your health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Iroha</strong> (voiced by Shigeru Chiba) – Legal (?) guardian of the three Onigashima sisters, and general chief of their operations. Possesses the reincarnated soul of the ogre leader who died hundreds of years prior. Struggles every day to raise his charges as true ogres, teaching them everything s/he knows. Yet, in the end, is still just a cat.</li><li><strong>Momotaro</strong> (voiced by Yoji Ueda) – Momotaro the 37th (Momotaro XXXVII?). Presently works as the #1 host in Kabukicho. Though probably not for much longer, all things considered! Basically, he’s the last boss. He’s had enough of the host life, and now wants to try his hand at being a supervillain. Turns out, he’s well suited to the role!</li><li><strong>And Many More, such as…</strong><ul><li><strong>Tsuru no Ongaeshi</strong> – The Vengeful Crane.</li><li><strong>Urashima Taro</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> – Select from the three Onigashima sisters and challenge main missions and side missions as the tale progresses, leveling up and earning items and money (to spend on items via online shopping, of course!) that help teach you new skills and toughen your stats for the inevitable face-off against Momotaro! Between each mission, listen to witty and often fourth wall-breaking banter among the girls, their cat guardian Iroha, and a wide variety of villains. This story doesn’t take itself very seriously, and neither should you! Just kick back and enjoy the ride!</li><li><strong>Cooperative <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [341 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></strong> – Up to three players at once can join the fray in this chaotic frenzy of a mode, wherein a number of enemies not seen anywhere else can be encountered, and a vast fortune can be earned through contiguous beatdowns and massively one-sided fights (I mean, it’s three of you against one boss enemy! OF COURSE you’re going to kick yokai tail!).</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new Elusive Target has entered Hitman's world of assassination, as players will have a month to take on the MMA Legend Conor McGregor. The former UFC champion will be playing The Disruptor, a notorious fighter who has risen to the top of the ranks and has a past shrouded in mystery. Pay no attention to the giant "McGregor" tattoo on his abdomen.</p><p>The Elusive Target can be found on Hitman 2's Isle of Sgàil, a secret refuge for the world's billionaires, and tasks Agent 47 with eliminating McGregor so that amateur MMA fighter--and Quantum Leap CEO--Tim Quinn doesn't suffer a brutal beatdown when he steps into the ring.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmlfSLcdDAU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmlfSLcdDAU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This mission will be free to play for everyone through a free starter pack in The Ostentatious--an Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor Elusive Target. You'll be tasked with completing multiple missions that escalate in difficulty, and if you fail, progress will restart from the first level and the contract will be locked for 12 hours. There'll also be new premium DLC featuring cosmetics inspired by McGregor.</p><p>Elusive Target missions are one of the more-challenging modes in Hitman. The people marked for death don't show up as a red silhouette when you search for them using Agent 47's instinct vision, so you have to find them, observe their patterns, and wait to perfectly execute your plan to take them down. This isn't the first time that players have had a chance to take down a celebrity, as shortly after the release of Hitman 2, a character modeled on and voiced by actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-still-kill-sean-bean-in-hitman-2/1100-6463369/" data-ref-id="1100-6463369">Sean Bean</a> was inserted into the game.

		<p>In life, the simple things are best. A peaceful walk through an autumnal forest, eating a melted marshmallow fresh and squishy from the barbecue, a classic Victoria sponge cake. When it comes to video games, the same life rule applies; and what better example than the old-school arcade racer? Thrills, spills, and no more complexity than going eye-dissolvingly fast in a mostly straight line. Horizon Chase 2 is the epitome of this ideology, it also has amongst the best local multiplayer features I’ve ever encountered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Chase 2 Launch Trailer | Out Now on PlayStation 4 &amp; 5 and Xbox Series &amp; One" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_kr1WraP5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Horizon Chase 2 is the sequel to the 2018 original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/31/horizon-chase-turbo-review/">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>, and it shares a great deal with its forebear – bright and bold 90’s visuals, easy-to-pick-up controls, and crazy fast top speeds. This then, is the most traditional of sequels: mostly more of the same, but bigger and better.</p>


<p>The visuals are an example of this design approach, having seen a noticeable improvement in detail, though thankfully retaining their charming old-school aesthetic. Whilst the array of vehicles is more limited than in the original game, they can each now be upgraded to a far greater extent, as well as being customisable. Swap out the tires, change the chassis, or splash out on some new paint – these options are hardly going to give Forza a run for its money but they are a neat addition.</p>


<p>I must say, the choice of available vehicles all play it rather straight. I found myself missing the comical cars like the Learner-Driver, the Camper-Van, and the Handy-Man Sedan. Perhaps these lighter-hearted mobiles will be released as DLC, but for the moment players are stuck with the sportiest of sports cars and little else.</p>
<p>Track design meanwhile, benefits from weather effects and more varied courses. The track will split into divergent paths before combining a little while later, whilst the cars can be battered by a passing sand storm. New pick-ups add a shade of complexity too; boosts litter the track, and nitro can be gained in segments rather than in one power-up. Also, players rejoice, no more fuel meter! Getting rid of this abomination was a smart move on behalf of the developers, lowering a big hurdle for new and young gamers alike. Now, rather than worrying about collecting fuel, players can just focus on the fun of going very fast.</p>
<p>And what speeds Horizon Chase 2 reaches! This is a super-slick game with an eye-wateringly fast frame rate to match, and the visual velocity is kept up even in four-player split screen.</p>

<p>There is far more online functionality this time out, which is a welcome addition, but it’s in local multiplayer that Horizon Chase 2 belongs. Along with regular races and tournaments, other players can easily drop into any event throughout the extensive world tour mode. They can even help out whilst racing, gathering collectibles that all go towards the primary player’s overall progress. Helping out your kid unlock a brand-new vehicle is one of those special multiplayer moments that Horizon Chase 2 has in droves.</p>

            <p>Capcom has released another update for Dragon's Dogma 2 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While the majority of adjustments have been made across all devices, the team has also added some console specific updates with this patch. It has now added the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off.</p>
<p>Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>As for that 120hz option, Capcom stated while this setting "does not guarantee 120fps", it "may make the game display more smoothly" should your monitor support it.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the above, this update takes aim at a number of the usual bugs and fixes across the board. For example, players will no longer be able to enter areas they weren't meant to be able to, and the prices for precious stones in Vermund should now be correct.</p>
<p>It has also added the function to sell items from the storage menu and the option to turn the Arisen's visibility on or off in photo mode.</p> <div>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>
<p>The game is "a huge improvement over the original, and a captivating journey from beginning to end," reads Eurogamer's five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer aims to use these tools to produce dynamic interaction between objects</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Roblox is working towards providing players the ability to create characters and objects with "4D generative AI".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai">recent post to its blog</a>, the developer explained that 4D generative AI will focus on interactivity when creating people, objects, and environments.</p>
<p>These 4D generative AI tools aim to make 3D objects more dynamic by using generative AI text or voice prompts to create a drivable race car, for example.</p>
<p>"With 4D generative AI, Roblox has opened up a new frontier for experience and asset creation," the developer explained. "While the challenges are new, our process for innovation is well honed.</p>
<p>"We will combine our internal research and development teams, university collaborations, and rapid iteration of prototypes in partnership with our community."</p>
<p>Last year, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>spoke to Roblox CTO Daniel Sturman <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/robloxs-top-tech-officer-talks-ai">about its conversational AI tool Roblox Assistant,</a> and how the company intended to use generative AI across various aspects of its platform.</p>

            <p>
The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has reawakened the typical Soulsborne debate around high difficulty, but even the game's creator struggled to play it.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a>, FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed playing Elden Ring in the run up to Shadow of the Erdtree but struggled as he's not a very good player.
</p>
<p>
"Leading up to the release of any game, I'll be very hands-on playing it and getting as much time on it as much as possible," he said. "But after the release, I tend to not want to touch it, because I know I'm going to either find things that I left on the table or issues that will bug me. And once I become a player, I'm powerless to do anything significant to change it. So once a game is out in the wild, I tend to not play."
</p>

<p>
He continued: "But in preparation for Shadow of the Erdtree, I played through the main story of Elden Ring. I want to preface this by saying I absolutely suck at video games, so my approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal, all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game ... the freedom and open-world nature of Elden Ring perhaps lowered the barrier to entry, and I might be the one who's benefiting the most from that, as a player, more than anyone else."
</p>
<p>
As an open world game, Elden Ring is more approachable than previous FromSoftware games, and provides players with plenty of options to help: be that co-operative play, extra summons, or simply wandering off to grind for runes. And if Miyazaki is relying on these features to finish the game, so can you.
</p>
<p>
It is somewhat amusing, however, that Miyazaki conjures these dark, terrifying worlds for players to battle in, but struggles to play them himself. No wonder he admitted to being a "huge masochist" in a <a href="http://soulslore.wikidot.com/das1-game-no-shokutaku#toc0">previous interview</a>.

</p>
<p>
"There are some areas that are designed to be funny and with humour in mind, but I think a lot of the time things we try to take seriously or try to approach from a serious or dark place tend to get construed as humour," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-on-originating-the-soulslike-genre">later told Eurogamer</a>. "But it's not a calculated thing, we don't set out to make a lot of these games and characters funny. I think it is just interpreted this way and is construed in that way due to the player and the environment they're playing in. A lot of it is not intentional."

</p>
<p>
Legendary player <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">Let Me Solo Her has now returned for Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to help players struggling with bosses, so look out for a summon sign if you're struggling.

</p>
<p>
FromSoftware also released an update for the game this week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">adjusts the balance scaling of Shadow Blessings</a>, which should make the DLC a little easier.

            <p>Development on slip-slidey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-3-rivals">Tribes 3: Rivals</a> is set to slow, just months after its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-is-out-in-early-access-now-for-another-shot-at-making-tribes-popular">early access launch</a>, as developers Prophecy Games say it’s not proving successful enough to "support the studio."</p>
<p>In a post ominously titled "<a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update">Tribes 3 Player Update</a>", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950580/Ultra_Strikers/">Ultra Strikers</a>. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.</p>

<p>"These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development", the post reads. "We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p>
<p>"Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!"</p>
<p>It's true that Tribes 3 didn’t launch into the same cult hit status as previous Tribeseses – according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>, its daily playercount dropped into the low hundreds within days of its early access release back in March. But it’s hard to see a way forward now that its remaining players can only expect small, sporadic updates at best.</p>

<p>I don’t mind admitting: this one stings, friends. Tribes 3 might have launched without much meat on the bones, with the combined-arms bombast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-ascend">Tribes: Ascend</a> looking a long way off, but I could see and feel it improving with several of its earlier patches. Especially the updates to the series’ signature skiing movement, which did eventually deliver the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/notes-from-the-tribes-3-rivals-playtest-its-fun-but-is-it-tribes">sense of breakneck pace I was hoping for</a>. Unfortunately, the game’s chances of riding that momentum into a new era of movement shooteriness seem slimmer than ever.</p>
<p>For many, that may not be a surprising outcome: certain sections of the Tribes fandom are famously suspicious of attempts to make a new version of the thing they like. In hindsight, maybe I too should have hardened my heart, given Ascend’s grim fate. But then isn’t there another way of looking at this? I waited a decade for more Tribes, and even if it wasn’t finished, and even if it was for only for a matter of weeks, <em>I had it</em>. Sometimes, letting yourself be hurt again isn’t an entirely bad thing.</p>

<p>A new update on the upcoming Street Fighter movie has revealed that it will be released in 2026, despite the project losing its directors.</p>



<p>In an update to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date-despite-reportedly-losing-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Sony Pictures confirmed that the movie will be released on March 20, 2026, but the company did not reveal who will now direct it. </p>



<p>So far, all we know about the project is that it’s being produced alongside Street Fighter publisher and developer Capcom, with directors Danny and Michael Philippou walking away from the project due to scheduling. </p>



<p>There has yet to be any official announcements on who will be cast in the film.</p>



<p>Street Fighter has already had two films, which were perceived pretty poorly by audiences. The 1994 film was given a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058516-street_fighter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20% audience score</a> on the&nbsp;review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes but did accumulate $100 million at the box office though on an estimated $35 million budget. 2009’s Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li didn’t fair much better either with audience ratings, coming in at <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/street_fighter_the_legend_of_chun_li" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">18%</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when we will get more updates on the upcoming movie, but with less than two years until its intended release date, information could trickle through soon.</p>
