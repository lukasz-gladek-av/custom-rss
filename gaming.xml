			<p>Aces of Thunder brings an authentic World War 2 plane combat simulation game, both to flat screens and VR. That authenticity means that not only are you flying very detailed planes through (mostly) WW2 era combat missions, but if you turn your plane too quickly, you’ll lose control and likely spin down into the ground. It’s pretty realistic in that way, sometimes to its own detriment, but its bigger issue is that it doesn’t feel like it’s finished.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aces of Thunder — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brbpCEupa6w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When launching the game, you’re presented with a very detailed plane. The one thing that Aces of Thunder really nails is the planes; they’re incredibly accurate both on the outside and inside. In the cockpit, the sheer number of dials is almost staggering, and they’re all labelled when you look at them – specifically by moving your head, if you’re playing in VR, and not with the PSVR2’s eye tracking, which is a shame.</p>


<p>The accuracy extends into the flight mechanics as well, with 24 planes featured in the base game, four of which are from WWI, and an additional five for DLC. Turn too quickly and you’ll either lose control in a mechanical sense, or you’ll blackout from the G-forces that pilots of this era weren’t equipped to handle. Take damage from the enemy and you can feel it affect the performance of the plane, hear it in the now slightly sputtery sounding engine or, worse, be unable to hear the engines at all! You can even personally take a bullet and die instantly. The game’s planes and physics are undeniably very impressive.</p>


<p>It’s a shame that the rest of the game seems to be either threadbare or unfinished. There’s no tutorial here, which would be welcome for a realistic recreation of flying planes that are nearly a century old. Instead, you’ll crash and crash again as you figure things out by trial and error, frustrated that you seemingly have to wait for your plane to spin all the way to the ground before you can respawn. Except, you can actually bail out with a parachute – if only the game had told me that and saved me the first moment of VR-related motion sickness I’ve experienced in years.</p>
<p>Trial and error is fine when the errors are clear and the trial is entertaining, but as the game doesn’t explain anything to you outside of a “getting your license” style mission for basic flight, you’re left to draw our own conclusions. Plane combat is just brief periods of intensity separated by longer periods of repositioning for another approach, so when you are flying through a swarm of enemy fighters missing every single one, all you can think about is “dDid I do something wrong? Am I missing something obvious?” All because the dogfighting simulation game didn’t give you any training. At least you maybe didn’t collide with one of them, so that’s progress at least.</p>
<p>Once you do get used to controlling a plane, there are still issues. How do you aim a bomb? I’m not really convinced my plane was dropping the bombs I was telling it to, because there was no explosion or other indication that I had. I spent half an hour trying to take out an aircraft carrier, getting more dangerously close with each attempt, but the thing was unharmed when I gave up on the mission entirely and went to play something else.</p>

<p>The UI – which is a bit of paper with a map and ammo info on it for some reason – tells me I’m dropping a bomb and that it takes a full minute to reload it, but there’s no feedback beyond that. The lack of feedback extends to dogfighting as well, but at least there you occasionally see a plane start smoking or fall out of the sky, when you’re bombing things, you’re too busy facing the other way to visually see. I could have been missing every single time for half an hour, but I’m really not convinced.</p>
<p>That paper map comes with a little floating circle to mark an objective, but it’s small enough to be practically invisible from any significant distance is all of it. In an early mission, you are directed to fly around an attack site to gather intel, which is incredibly simple to do but immersive and satisfying nonetheless as the things you fly past are listed over the radio. Then the game tells you that enemy planes have been spotted coming in for another attack. Oh no! But it doesn’t tell you where from – there’s no direction or heading, they’re not marked on your map, and you can’t see them on the horizon. Cue the confused John Travolta meme until they eventually get close enough a few minutes later.</p>

<p>If you can bear the trial and error of getting use to Aces of Thunder, there are a good amount of single player missions to play through. Some of them are bare “follow a path” missions, and most of them end abruptly, sometimes with little to no input from you – I’ve won three missions without actually successfully shooting any planes early on. There’s also free play, where you can just fly around in a plane of your choice, or set up a custom battle on one of the maps, and then there’s online multiplayer. This is in two forms, with the “To Battle” button dropping you into a game with matchmaking, and the custom game, where you can see a list of custom games are join them. The former always put me into matches with too few players, and while the latter all of the custom games claim they have 30 players, actually loading in would reveal it was one or two. So the multiplayer isn’t exactly populated, but it would work if you’ve got some dedicated friends.</p>
<p>Then there are weird issues both in and out of VR. The handheld menu you use whilst in VR is also the menu when you’re not in VR, which feels a bit strange. Playuing with the PSVR2 Sense controllers means you have quite small analogues and, as throttle is on the left along with yaw, you can end up cutting your engine by accident. It’s much better with the DualSense (or there’s HOTAS joystick support, though I don’t have one to test with), but when you do, your VR hands are still there often blocking the map, and you can’t use any of the menus, including the pause menu, without them, in spite of the fact that when you’re not in VR you use the exact same menu with the DualSense. It’s a bit odd, at the very least.</p>

		<p>Developer Canteen Games along with publisher Weekend Games have announced a new horror exploration game called Remote Control, in which you need to find out what has happened to a derelict spaceship where all the crew has died. It is all a very mysterious circumstance, but you don’t need to risk your own life to find out what has happened. Instead you have 12 human proxies that must obey your every command to send into the ship to discover the horrible truth and uncover the secrets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Remote Control | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFe60XwXj40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To command the 12 proxies remotely you need to type commands that they are forced to carry out. Those commands could be as simply as turning in a certain direction or opening something, but things to get disturbing as the trailer shows with one proxy being commanded to walk into a fire. It shows that there is something very unsettling about this whole set up, and that is not limited to the derelict spaceship as there seems to be something weird going on in your own office too. Things will get tough as some proxies may fight your commands and try to disobey, which means you will have to take decisions to bring them back in line. If you want to try Remote Control out for yourself you can with <a href="https://canteengames.itch.io/remote-control">a free demo on itch.io.</a></p>
<p>The full release of Remote Control is expected this year on PC.</p>

<p>Fever dream</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> arrives on Switch 2 this week, and to mark the occasion, Nintendo has released the game's action-packed opening movie.</p>
<p>You'll find the full cutscene above, which shows Mario and Bowser locked in a bitter back-and-forth on the court with Peach and Daisy. Naturally, the Fever Rackets are the stars of the show, with the movie showcasing a whole host of power-ups and their effect on the court — stick around until the very end to see the clean-up operation.</p>
<p>Our biggest takeaway, however, was just how darn <em>tasty</em> the visuals look. We love all of the little details on display (the wobble of Mario's nose when he serves, Bowser's luscious locks moving in the breeze, the individual blades of grass getting kicked up with every step), but how about that slow-mo and the ever-increasing ridiculousness of the power-ups, eh? Talk about <em>cinema</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, opening movie visuals are rarely the best indicator of how things will look in-game, but from the gameplay that we've seen so far, Fever is shaping up to be a rather handsome sports title.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever will hit the court later this week on <strong>12th February</strong>. Initial <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-mario-tennis-fever">previews</a> were strong, so let's keep our fingers crossed that the full game can deliver.</p>

			<p>While <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is sensibly easier than previous games, it is still challenging. <strong>Human enemies</strong> tend to block a lot, while <strong>Yokai</strong> only stagger with attacks when they are out of Ki.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Depleting an enemy's Ki</strong> has always been the core of the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh</em> experience, but getting to do so at the start of the game can be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">difficult</strong>, as both your knowledge of the game's mechanics and weapons is limited, and you can't access many Martial Arts that deal solid Ki damage in a short amount of time.</p>



<p>The only workaround to this issue is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">slowing the enemy down</strong>, allowing you to get more attacks in. This holds true even more for bosses, whose high speed can overwhelm less experienced players.</p>



<p>Embrace the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Way of the Mystic</strong>: use these Talismans to utterly destroy every enemy in the game.</p>

<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Slowing down enemies</strong> isn't just a way to get more time to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">style on them with aerial Ninja combos</strong> or unleash a sequence of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Martial Arts empowered by Arts Proficiency</strong> in Samurai Style. It is, hands down, the <strong>single most powerful strategy against bosses.</strong></p>



<p>To master this, you need to leverage the new <strong>Onmyo Box</strong> system and two specific <strong>Soul Cores</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-sudama-core-thunderstorm-shot">The Sudama Core (Thunderstorm Shot)</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Sudama-Core-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Sudama Soul Core provides one the best Talismans in the game</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> The Sudama Core can be found by <strong>trading any item</strong> with any of the <strong>Sudama</strong> in the game. These are the little aratama spirits with a half-skull hat found in all maps and in the Eternal Rift.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Effect:</strong> Positioning the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sudama Core</strong> in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Yang position</strong> grants you <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">8x Thunderstorm Shot </strong><strong>T</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">alismans</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are, simply put, incredibly powerful. With a clear shot where the enemy is hit multiple times, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Electrified</strong> is almost guaranteed to apply to most enemies in the game.</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-fundamental-skill-for-consistency">Fundamental Skill For Consistency</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Awakening-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Awakening Mastery Skill is essential for any Onmyo mage</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>The&nbsp;<strong>Awakening</strong>&nbsp;Mastery Skill, which reduces Onmyo magic casting time, is&nbsp;<strong>mandatory</strong>&nbsp;for the mo</span>st consistent application of this strategy. Without it, you will likely be <strong>punished</strong> during the casting animation against the game's faster bosses, who won't leave you any time to cast these spells.</p>



<p>This skill is learned after completing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Way of Onmyo: Novice</strong> mission. This can be started in the Eternal Rift after clearing the first Crucible in the Warring States map.</p>



<h2 id="h-field-testing-takeda-s-four-heavenly-kings">Field Testing: Takeda's Four Heavenly Kings</h2>

<p>I struggled for some time in the <em>Takeda's Four Heavenly Kings</em> optional mission—a boss rush against the major bosses of the Warring States map.</p>



<p>I found that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">4 Sloth talismans</strong> simply weren't enough to cover all the bosses in the rush. However, by combining the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">8x Talisman Shots</strong> from the Sudama Core with my Samurai Guardian Spirit <strong>Shin-Roku</strong>, <strong>Uncanny Bolt Ninjutsu</strong>, and <strong>Lightning Familiar</strong> from the Raiju Core, I maintained almost <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">100% uptime</strong> of the Electrified status on every boss.</p>



<p>For <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yamagata Masakage</strong>, who was still too fast on his horse for my liking, I also used a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sloth Talisman</strong> on top of the Electrified status for even more reduced movement speed. </p>

<p>If you are feeling confident about applying the Electrified status effect, you can take this further by applying more status ailments such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Saturation</strong> (Water)</li>



<li><strong>Blustered</strong> (Wind)</li>



<li><strong>Burn</strong> (Fire)</li>
</ul>



<p>Applying two or more status ailments simultaneously applies <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Confusion</strong>. At its lowest level, Confusion lets you inflict <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">40% more damage</strong> to an enemy. We will cover the complexities of the Confusion system in greater detail in a future guide.</p>

            <p>Tundra Interactive, the indie developer behind the indie strategy RPG Void War, has at last spoken out about why the game was temporarily removed from Steam earlier this year. The reason? Well, according to Tundra , it all has to do with a particular set of bulky, familiar-looking shoulder pads.</p>
<p>The original DMCA take down was issued by one Mal Reynolds on behalf of Games Workshop. Tundra initially believed this to be a troll takedown, given Mal Reynolds is the protagonist's name in Firefly, but it turns out this was a legitimate DMCA by the UK tabletop juggernaut.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">Speaking to IGN</a>, Tundra Interactive confirmed the DMCA's legitimacy, and claimed the given reason for the takedown notice was a pair of shoulder-pads shown off in its original featured trailer, described by Games Workshop as: "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Here's that bloke and his shoulders, for reference. Does this look like a space marine to you? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Tundra Interactive.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking at this character, and his shoulder pads, there is a clear resemblance between the bloke and a Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine. With the big spike attached, one could likely be mistaken for thinking it were a Chaos Astartes. Tundra told IGN it disagreed with this opinion from Games Workshop, but took the trailer off the Steam store page nonetheless .</p>
<p>In a statement issued to IGN, Tundra stated: "All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists. While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations."</p><p>Regardless of this minor hurdle for Tundra and Void War, the game is back up on Steam seemingly unhampered by the DMCA notice, with a new trailer present to be safe. A word of warning perhaps, Games Workshop is keeping an eye out for potential copyright infringement! Be careful when designing grimdark sci-fi accessories for your bulky soldiers, folks.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>' director Ryosuke Horii has addressed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-fans-are-demanding-sega-recast-a-kiwami-3-actor-and-dark-ties-may-make-the-situation-worse">controversial casting of actor Teruyuki Kagawa in the remake</a>, which has resulted in fan backlash due to a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022">2022 report from Shukan Shincho</a> detailing sexual assault allegations against the actor. Kagawa apologised at the time, but didn't specify what he was apologising for or confirm the events reported in Shukan Shincho's article.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking about Kagawa's casting as Kiwami 3 secondary antagonist Goh Hamazaki in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2077376.html">GAME Watch</a>, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">IGN</a> have subsequently translated, Horii said the following:</p>
<blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote>
<p>The RGG Studio developer also added that not recasting characters like Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro - the latter a key ally of Kiwami 3 protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, played in the new version of the game by Show Kasamatsu - would have "certainly be safer" in terms of avoiding "online criticism". However, Horii said, RGG "felt there was no use being afraid".</p><p>As of writing, Horii's comments are the only response RGG Studio have made to the backlash against Kagawa's casting in the remake. Publishers Sega declined to provide a statement on the matter when approached for comment by RPS last month. I've reached out to Sega for comment again in light of Horii's comments.</p>
<p>As of writing, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3">fan petition</a> calling for Kagawa to be removed from his role as Goh Hamazaki in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 has amassed just under 10,000 signatures. The remake is set to release later this week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch’s ‘Anran’ Actor Bags on ‘Ozempic Chic’ Character Design]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/</link>
            <guid>1429723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fareeha, a content creator and actor, recently announced on social media that <strong>she’s </strong>the voice of Anran in Overwatch. The newly-added character has been making impressions of late, but Fareeha wanted to take the profile of her addition and go a different way entirely with her feedback.</p>



<p>In a three-minute video uploaded on social media, Fareeha revealed that she’s disappointed with her character’s design and that her vision wasn’t anything close to what Blizzard ultimately produced. She insinuated it falls within the realms of ‘Ozempic Chic’, with developers adhering to unrealistic body standards and producing only slim, traditionally attractive female characters.</p>







<p>Fareeha’s three-minute video has been met with a mixed reception on social media, with some aligning with her values while others have accused the creator of spreading a rhetoric that doesn’t belong in gaming.</p>



<p>She explained her stance on Anran’s design, stating that she had to address the ‘elephant in the room’ but didn’t want to ‘step on the devs’ toes’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for and the design we ended up with. Because I think in her comic and the cinematic element, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We’re going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing, ransacking media these days.’</p>



<p>The ‘Ozempic Chic’, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose!’ And I think because of that precedent, people feel, understandably, let down.</p>



<p>Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Trying to break those moulds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fareeha went on to suggest that Anran’s design ‘leaves a bad taste’ in the mouths of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> fans. She suggests that the model’s design doesn’t match the character’s energy and personality because she’s ‘too docile’ and looks like ‘the younger sister’.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm the voice of Anran in Overwatch!!! 🧡</p><p>I held off on posting about this because I wanted to make sure I could do this discussion justice. Here's a shot at that! </p><p>Let's keep rooting for the version of her that could be. I hope you have so much fun playing her!! 🔥🪭 <a href="https://t.co/jbFbKHPVpb">pic.twitter.com/jbFbKHPVpb</a></p></div>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the difference between Anran’s design in the game’s cinematics and in <strong>the game </strong>is pretty obvious, which is a huge sticking point for fans. But some took her words to mean that she’s angry that her character is ‘attractive and thin’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that the average gamer has taken a hugely judgmental approach to gauging the success of a game based on how its characters look. Just days ago, we saw similar comments surface regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-new-horizon-multiplayer-game/">reveal of Hunter’s Gathering</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Horizon world, which features a heavy-set female character that instantly became the subject of ridicule.</p>



<p>It was the same thing with Concord in 2024.</p>



<p>Do you think Fareeha is right to be concerned about her character’s design, or is it not that deep? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[XboxEra Rebrands as ‘DayOne’ and Promises Busy Year Ahead]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xboxera-rebrands-dayone-busy-year-ahead/</link>
            <guid>1429720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our friends at XboxEra have today unveiled a rebrand that pivots the platform away from a focused identity to a wider, more general gaming perspective. Going forward, XboxEra will be known as ‘DayOne’, a rebrand that goes hand-in-hand with a new website, membership service, and a teaser for an upcoming video game backed by the team.</p>



<p>The team at DayOne explained that this monumental shift <em>‘refocuses (them) on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games.’</em></p>



<h2 id="h-one-xbox-era-ends-another-begins">One (Xbox)Era Ends, Another Begins</h2>



<p>The team at XboxEra has performed a major rebrand, taking the popular news platform and turning it <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/xboxera-is-changing-welcome-to-dayone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into DayOne</a>, a multi-faceted brand aimed at representing the wider gaming market. In a statement issued to Insider Gaming, DayOne’s Jon Clarke explained the need for the change after many years in the business:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When XboxEra launched, the name made a lot of sense. We wanted to build a website focused on Xbox, built by people that actually played there. It was just before the dawn of a new generation and it’s been a pretty crazy time – and it’s fair to say a lot has changed!</p>



<p>Ultimately as time went on, we found ourselves covering – and wanting to cover – more than just Xbox. PC, VR, Nintendo and PlayStation – and all of the industry turbulence, news and culture that came with it. </p>



<p>Beyond all of that though, DayOne refocuses us on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games, and bringing our readers the best in news, reviews and previews – on day one. It’s a name that we feel ultimately honours our roots and where we came from, but gives us complete freedom to make our corner of the internet even more awesome. </p>



<p>We’re looking to have our new site and membership service live after testing with our community over the course of this month. <strong>It’s going to be a very busy year</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rebrand coincides with the team’s <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/the-xboxera-podcast-episode-300-celebration-brings-in-some-big-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300th podcast episode</a>, furthering the cause for celebration. That same podcast will now also be rebranded, adopting the name ‘DayOne Podcast’.</p>



<p>Since 2019, XboxEra has existed in one form or another, starting as that podcast that evolved into a wider news platform. The team reported that 2025 was their biggest year yet for readership, growth, and milestones.</p>



<p>Also, in the most recent episode of the podcast, the team teased the upcoming launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-wars-the-card-game-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Console Wars: The Card Game</a> in <strong>video game </strong>form, expanding on the TCG that they developed and released last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But has it survived the cuts and cancelations?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">More details of the unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rayman"><u>Rayman</u></a> remake have bubbled up again, this time from the creator of Rayman himself, Michel Ancel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://retrogamesofficial.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RetroGamer</u></a>, Ancel discussed the secret project, confirming that rather than a remaster that simply presents the same game with slightly snazzier visuals, the re-release — which Ancel calls a "remake" — will also address some of the original platformer's pain-points, including additional checkpoints to "make it a bit less frustrating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Rayman is still a fun game, and there's a lot of content," Ancel said in the interview that was <a href="https://x.com/raymanmerch/status/2020239543279178007" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared</u></a> by fan account, Rayman Merchandise. "The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today. Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: Series creator Michel Ancel reveals in a new Retro Gamer article that Rayman 1 will be receiving an HD rerelease! This follows previous reports of a "Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition" being rated. (I apologize for the new post; my prior post was incorrectly worded) <a href="https://t.co/jzKlTg6on3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jzKlTg6on3</a></p>— Rayman Merchandise (@raymanmerch) <a href="https://twitter.com/raymanmerch/status/2020239543279178007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't remember when specifically, but it will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating. I think it's a nice move, because that's the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an extraordinary insight given the project hasn't officially been confirmed by Ubisoft yet, but it does make sense, as we were told late last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-its-working-on-the-future-of-rayman-but-dont-expect-news-from-us-too-soon">Ubisoft is set to celebrate all things Rayman as it prepares to mark the series' 30th anniversary</a>, including information about the "future" of the series. At the time, the <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Rayman X/Twitter account</u></a> had long been dormant, but last September, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-its-working-on-the-future-of-rayman-but-dont-expect-news-from-us-too-soon"><u>it was resurrected to bring us up to speed on what's happening in Rayman's world</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy," the account exclaimed at the time, attaching a brief video. In the video, brand producer Loic Gounon — who has been working on the Rayman franchise since 2006 — revealed that "a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October 2024, Ubisoft confirmed a new Rayman project was currently in the "exploration phase" at its Montpelier and Milan studios, after it was reported that Ancel had been contacted to act as a consultant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft began this year by announcing a sizable company restructure, resulting in the cancelation of six games, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake"><u>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</u></a>, and a delay to a further seven titles. Two Ubisoft studios will close completely as a result of the changes, while others are subject to further layoffs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the half-dozen games that have been fully scrapped, Ubisoft only publicly named one: its long-awaited Sands of Time remake that had been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-remake-ubisoft-montreal"><u>rebooted once already</u></a>. Three of the other canceled games were new IPs, while one was a mobile game. We've received no specific details of the seven titles that Ubisoft has delayed, either, though this number does include the unannounced game once set for launch before March 31 that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake"><u>widely expected to be the company's Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster</u></a>. This will now launch in the coming financial year — so before March 31, 2027. With Ubisoft's core focus going forward being open-world and live-service games, it's not clear how — if at all — a Rayman remake fits into those plans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman"><u>Ubisoft quietly released an NFT game featuring Rayman at the end of 2024</u></a>, of course. Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. was barely advertised or given the kind of showy spotlight reserved for major releases, quite possibly because it's a Web 3 game that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain. A top-down multiplayer shooter available on PC, it featured a number of Ubisoft characters, including Rayman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <p>Pokémon has never <em>not</em> been trendy, but we're expecting even more from the massive IP this year, as the "pocket monsters" are turning 30 later this month. That means there are game announcements on the horizon, celebrations happening all over, and even a huge Super Bowl spot starring Lady Gaga and other celebrities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-special-video-set-for-super-bowl-2026">First teased last week</a>, the 'What's Your Favorite?' ad played during last night's Super Bowl match and was also released online by The Pokémon Company, who enlisted a number of world-renowned individuals to essentially yap about their favourite Pokémon. The highlight here is Lady Gaga performing Jigglypuff's iconic song from the anime, but the whole thing feels adequately cute:</p> <figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="What’s Your Favorite? | #Pokemon30" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3O4ymaZ41Q?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>What’s Your Favorite? | #Pokemon30</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3O4ymaZ41Q?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J3O4ymaZ41Q?autoplay=1" title="What’s Your Favorite? | #Pokemon30">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3O4ymaZ41Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The list of celebrities in the spot includes comedian Trevor Noah, Blackpink's Jisoo, F1 driver Charles Leclerc, football player Lamine Yamal, actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and singer Young Miko as they reveal their favourite Pokémon. You have safe picks like Arcanine and Jigglypuff, whereas others go for Zygarde or Luxray. No Pikachu here, which makes these clips feel somewhat genuine.</p>
<p>The end of the video also encourages Pokémon fans to create Pokémon 30 snapshots with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon GO</a> app with a "What's Your Favorite" filter. Though this promo, which has cost The Pokémon Company millions of dollars just for the Super Bowl slot alone, focuses on the mobile sensation and people's connection with the largely adorable creatures, it's a fun way to kick off a "year of Pokémon" that probably has many surprises in store for us.</p><p>We're not expecting much talk of new games until after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> comes out early next month, but perhaps the 27th February (the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-original-pokemon-games-took-lots-of-trial-and-error-to-develop">Pokémon Green &amp; Red</a> were originally released) will arrive with a stream that outlines the immediate future of Pokémon video games. That's just wishful thinking, but it would make sense, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Whats your favourite?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has officially launched its <strong>'What's Your Favourite'</strong> campaign as part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>Kicking off during the Super Bowl LX game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the ad features singer Lady Gaga alongside Trevor Noah, Jisoo, Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko as they reveal their favourite Pokémon from the series.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga's choice, as expected, is Jigglypuff, famed for its singing abilities ("in be4 jokes about Gaga sending people to sleep") The two even perform a short yet charming duet together to sing Jigglypuff's song, and it's clearly got the YouTube comments in a flurry of excitement, with one user stating "LADY GAGA SINGING WITH JIGGLYPUFF MY LIFE IS MADE". Ours too.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a fun little ad, though arguably not what more hardcore fans want to see from the 30th anniversary celebrations. We daresay that most folks have got their fingers crossed for a release of the original Game Boy / GBA games for Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>The 20th anniversary saw the launch of several OG titles for the 3DS on 27th February 2016, so we'll definitely be keeping an eye out for something similar later this month.</p>

			<p>A few days ago, during <strong>AMD</strong>'s Q4 earnings call, CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong> shared some comments on the launches of <strong>Microsoft's Xbox Next Gen console</strong> and <strong>Valve's Steam Machine</strong>. When it comes to the Steam Machine, she said <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve was on track to launch it in early 2026</a>; however, in the span of a few hours, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-actually-gets-slight-delay-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Steam users</a> that <strong>it had to delay finalizing the shipping schedule and pricing</strong> due to the ongoing RAM shortage.</p>



<p>Regarding the Xbox Next Gen hardware, Lisa Su <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated that it was tracking well for a launch at some point next year</a></strong>. However, it appears that she was once again a little more eager than the client might have wanted. Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published a report</a> citing that Microsoft sources were a little surprised at her comment, as <strong>there is no hard commitment to 2027 yet</strong>. It is when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would like to launch the console</a>, but there's still work to do before committing to next year. In Su's defense, it's not on the hardware side, at least according to Windows Central. Instead, Microsoft wants to ensure that the underlying operating system and interface are as polished as needed. As such, Windows Central reckons 2027 is currently a "best case scenario".</p>



<p>This is because much of Microsoft's vision for the Xbox Next Gen console hinges on successfully merging the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) sides. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The first step was the Xbox handheld</a>, but there's a lot more that needs to be done. The console will start in Xbox "mode" with a console-like interface, but <strong>users can apparently "exit" to full-fledged Windows 11 whenever they want and run basically any program there</strong>. Furthermore, just as on regular Windows, Xbox users will be able to get games from other PC stores, such as Steam or the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Given this approach, it's perhaps not much of a surprise to learn that the Xbox Next Gen console will feature Microsoft's vision when it comes to specs and pricing, but <strong>other OEM partners like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS</a> or Lenovo could come up with their own versions that are either more or less powerful (and consequently more or less expensive) than Microsoft's official Xbox</strong>. </p>



<p>The report doesn't share much on the Xbox Next Gen console's pricing, other than Microsoft <strong>seemingly targeting a more premium offering</strong> (they did, after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise the largest technical leap to date</a>). The ongoing memory shortages, as well as US tariffs, are making it hard to pin down pricing at this point.</p>



<p>Still, it sounds like Microsoft itself isn't too worried if the launch price is a little high, because cross-generation with the current consoles is expected to continue for even longer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than the last time</a>. This means <strong>users could continue playing their Xbox Series S or X for years before any exclusive Xbox Next Gen games are released</strong>. </p>



<p>By the way, according to Windows Central, <strong>a first-party Xbox handheld could still happen later down the line</strong> (despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous reports to the contrary</a>), although the focus is presently on the main "console".</p>

            <p>Initial player data indicates that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is performing well following its release last Friday, hitting nearly 90,000 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend. It is currently at the top of Steam's Trending Games list.</p>
<p>Nioh 3, the latest triple-A release from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, hit an all-time peak of 88,045 concurrent PC players on Sunday <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. This is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>. The big difference, aside from a potential increase in popularity? Nioh 3 is the first game in the series to launch simultaneously on PC and console.</p>
<p>With that, it's worth considering Nioh 3 is also available on the PlayStation 5, so these figures are only one half of the whole picture. While player data isn't as readily available on console platforms, the game does currently have a 4.48 star rating on the PlayStation store.

<p>It's not just a case of good-looking numbers, either. Nioh 3 is currently sitting on a very positive rating on Steam, with games critic reviews praising the game in droves. The game is currently sitting at 86 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>As for Eurogamer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review"> it was described as "a historical high for Team Ninja" in our review</a>. Dom Peppiat summarises the game's merits with the following: "Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has been in a pretty good place since 2020's Wastelanders update, which added NPCs and entirely new questlines to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess">the once-barren online survival game</a>. Since then, it's become more of a full-blown multiplayer RPG with a strong diehard community even if not every Fallout fan vibes with the basic pitch. Why don't we have crossplay though?</p>
<p>This question has been repeatedly raised by the players over the years, and you'd think the development team is tired of giving negative answers by now, but something could change at some point in the future. Just don't expect an update to happen soon.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-no-crossplay-cross-progression-feature/">a roundtable interview</a> in late 2025 where the idea of having crossplay was shot down due to the "huge technical hurdle" it'd be to figure out almost eight years after launch, there's a new hope to latch on to. During an interview with creative director Jon Rush and production director Bill LaCoste (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/">Polygon</a>), a more positive update on the matter was given.</p>
<p>"We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us... It's just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it," Rush said. Don't expect proper commitment to the idea, as it sounds like Bethesda is just exploring options as the community doesn't let go of the idea, but the door hasn't been fully shut yet.</p><p>LaCoste once again brought up the "technical hurdles" of going back to the game's roots after years of iteration and trying to rework its innards into something that supports shared online play across all platforms without breaking anything in the process: "So going back and retrofitting it to do that, when you have different places that players are pointing into, and now you're having to worry about entitlements and account purchases and currency." If you've been around long enough, you know we also have to add to the pile of potential issues Creation Engine's infamous creakiness and tendency to crashing.</p>
<p>While it seems crossplay remains a distant dream, this is yet another example of organized movement from the most dedicated portion of a game's community making a difference. A few years ago, we'd lost all hope of Fallout 76 ever getting a current-gen upgrade, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-native-versions-for-xbox-series-x-and-s-and-ps5-early-2026">that will be happening later this year</a>, so it's never too late to turn things around if the interest is there and the financials make sense.</p>
<p>In any case, the numbers should be good enough, as Fallout Season 2 has made us (and seemingly many people) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">excited for Fallout's overall future</a> and Bethesda is happily adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-goes-free-to-celebrate-tv-shows-season-2-conclusion-adds-a-30-cosmetic-cameo">$30 power armour cosmetics</a> to a game that many were burying ages ago.</p>

			<p>The announcement of the highly anticipated <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this week's <strong>State of Play</strong></a> broadcast, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/post-151055929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider shinobi602</a>, but it will be relatively soon, and the same goes for the game's release; <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-natedrake-says-there-will-be-a-playstation-state-of-play-in-february-up-feb-12th.1416025/page-7#post-151057333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>both are "not too far off"</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's now been more than two and a half years since we first heard that Ubisoft was crafting an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The original rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from Kotaku</a>, which also reported that <strong>Ubisoft Singapore</strong>, the studio behind the Black Flag-inspired game <strong>Skull and Bones</strong>, was likely involved in the development.</p>



<p>The next big confirmation came from an unlikely source: the actor who played protagonist Edward Kenway. <strong>Matt Ryan</strong>, the actor best known for playing <strong>DC's John Constantine</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically told a fan at a signing event that the remake was coming</a>. Later, he would say that Ubisoft <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened him with a lawsuit unless he shut up about it</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, last September, French website Jeux Vidéo Magazine shared the first actual info on the remake. Ubisoft reportedly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut off the boring modern-day sections of the original game (in which players took the role of an unnamed Abstergo research analyst) and added more quests and content to explore as Edward Kenway</a></strong>. Furthermore, the report said moving from land to ship and vice versa would now be seamless.</p>



<p>In late November, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed that Ubisoft was targeting March 2026</a>, right before the end of the fiscal year, for the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake. The announcement appeared imminent when the European game rating board, PEGI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new classification for a game titled <strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, the game was included <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a list of titles that were delayed as part of Ubisoft's "major reset"</a>, while the publisher also cancelled another highly anticipated remake, <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</strong>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-gonna-cancel-it-like-you-canceled-sands-of-time-ubisofts-reply-to-new-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-leak-draws-ire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made fans worried the same fate could befall the Black Flag remake</a>, but based on Shinobi602's information, that shouldn't happen. In fact, it shouldn't be long until we can play it.</p>

Trevor Noah prefers Psyduck, Leclerc chooses Arcanine, Jisoo picks Eevee, Ramakrishnan chooses Luxray, Yamal picks Zygarde, and Young Miko's partner is Gengar. Shockingly, The Pokémon Company managed not to put Pikachu in this ad anywhere (except in the logo, of course)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ad ends with all the celebrities asking the audience, "What's your favorite?" This question is the start of a year-long campaign put on by The Pokémon Company in celebration of its 30th anniversary. In addition to the ad, The Pokémon Company is kicking things off by introducing a new camera feature to Pokémon GO (which is somehow ten years old this year!) that allows users to participate in the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, The Pokémon Company has promised various events, including "Day Out" and "Night Out" experiences designed for fans to celebrate Pokémon, with daytime events more family-focused and nighttime events more for adults who grew up with the series. The Pokémon Company has also already announced other celebratory events, such as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon">themed TCG collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Pokémon LEGO sets</a>.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's 30th is a big moment for the franchise, and we're expecting them to celebrate in style. Historically Pokémon has thrown a big digital showcase entitled Pokémon Presents on or around Pokémon Day (February 27), where the company lays out its plans for the year across video games, the TCG, and merchandise. Fans are eagerly hoping for the announcement of a new Pokémon game, perhaps a remake of beloved DS games Black and White, or the kick-off for the next generation of Pokémon, Gen 10. Heck, at this point, I'd just be happy to have the classic games on Nintendo Switch Online!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

<p>The 30th anniversary of Pokemon took center stage for a brief moment during Super Bowl 60.</p>



<p>An entire generation of kids who wanted to be the “very best like no one ever was” has grown into a population of adults who have taken different paths but share a love of Pokemon and fond memories of it.</p>



<p>That love was on display in a Super Bowl 60 commercial. Trevor Noah, Lady Gaga, Blackpink’s Jisoo, and more all named their favorites and spoke about why they have a love for the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-lady-gaga-s-favorite-is-jigglypuff">Lady Gaga’s Favorite Is Jigglypuff</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga is a fan of Jigglypuff. The Grammy Award-winning Superstar praised the fairy-type Pokemon for using her voice as a means of protection and self-defense. Gaga even noted that Jigglypuff has a 12-octave vocal range.</p>



<p>Trevor Noah remarked that his favorite is Psyduck. Noah praised Psyduck for its ability to change the world with its mind. He also said that every time you met a new one, it was like meeting a new part of yourself.</p>



<p>Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko also appeared in the ad, which ran for just over a minute.</p>

<h2 id="h-pokemon-turns-30">Pokemon Turns 30</h2>



<p>2026 is a big year for Pokemon. It has been 30 years since Pokemon Red and Blue launched on the original Nintendo Game Boy. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/">Pokemon Day</a> falls on February 27 every year. </p>



<p>Each year, a stream hosted by The Pokemon Company sets the stage for the franchise’s immediate future. This year, fans expect the launch of the 10th generation of everyone’s favorite friendly monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>
