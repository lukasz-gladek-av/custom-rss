            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.52, and it's bringing three sleek new cars for you to check out, plus a few extra bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Your first new car is the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR GSR '04, which...well, to be honest, that's a mighty fine bunch of numbers and letters, but I'm not enough of a car enthusiast to know what they mean. I'm sure it's fast, though!</p>
<p>You're also getting the Nissan GT-R Premium Edition T-spec '24, a speedy-looking sports car with a pretty beautiful dashboard, as well as the Toyota Hiace Van DX '16, which won't be winning any races but which looks like a sturdy and reliable enough little vehicle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.52-toyota-hiace.jpg?itok=mPYgkw6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.52-toyota-hiace.jpg?itok=tVFgBCUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Toyota Hiace is a sweet little van you're getting as part of&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.52.</figcaption></figure><p>Other new features in this update include a brand new Cafe menu, which shows off an Audi collection and features some fun info about the German car industry.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new World Circuit events, including the Sunday Cup, which takes place on the Tokyo Expressway, as well as the Circuit de Sainte-Croix's Nissan GT-R Cup and the Kyoto Driving Park's Evolution Meeting.</p>
<p>More tracks have also been made compatible with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI, so you've got more places to test your skills against this advanced driving intelligence. Just don't be ashamed if you lose; that's what it's built for, after all.</p>

<p>This update is the latest in a long string of content drops for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, which have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-physics-new-cars">brought plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144">new cars</a> to the game since it launched back in March 2022, as well as new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some of these updates have been able to take the sting out of Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted">delisting&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em>without warning</a> back in January, which probably left a fair few racing fans in the lurch.</p>
<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>. Update 1.52 is due to arrive tomorrow, so make sure you're ready for it when it's up for download!</p>

<p>Nintendo has taken down another popular Nintendo Switch emulator as its war on emulation continues on all fronts. According to the social media accounts for the platform, the Ryujinx emulator has been shut down after the developer was “offered an agreement” by Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” developer riperiperi said in the <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">software’s Discord server</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p>







<p>As of writing, all of the emulators files have been removed from GitHub, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download page</a> on the Ryujinx website is empty,  and there are no more official updates coming to the software.</p>



<p>Ryujinx shutting down is the latest in a long line of Nintendo going after emulators and emulation in general. Earlier this year they had Switch emulator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu shut down</a>. They also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-going-after-more-people-with-lawsuits/">multiple lawsuits</a> going regarding emulation and piracy.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

After so many years of production, the risk that the game will have any shortcomings is unnecessary for us.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters Screenshots - Steam Next Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p>The Alters is a survival video game set for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, with a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service.

After crash landing on a desolate planet with a scorching star, Jan must avoid the murderous conditions by taking refuge in a cutting-edge mobile base. The only issue? It’s meant to be operated by a skilled team and he’s just Jan.</blockquote><blockquote>Thankfully, fate takes a turn with the discovery of Rapidium, a mysterious substance exclusive to this perilous world. Interacting with the Quantum Computer on board the mobile base allows Jan to manipulate pivotal decisions from his past—creating alternate versions of himself known as Alters—that have the potential to change everything.</blockquote><p>The announcement of the delay comes hot on the heels of 11 bit studios’ release of city-building survival sequel Frostpunk 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-hits-350000-copies-sold-which-is-enough-for-the-dev-to-break-even-but-not-enough-to-prevent-a-share-price-collapse">which sold enough copies to break even but not enough to prevent a share price collapse</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Human bodies are frail and quickly fall to enemy attacks or suffer enough damage. During times when both guarding and evasion are difficult, use possession to swiftly escape, and do not hesitate to discard bodies when they are no longer of use. Even Rarities have trouble defeating enemies alone, so use humans in the area aggressively.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_028.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Deflect and Evade</strong></p><p>Enemy attacks can be repelled and neutralized with “Deflect”—A guide will display in the direction just before an enemy attacks. While in a defensive stance (guard), it will activate if the camera is shifted in that direction right when the guide lights up. When Deflect is successful, it will throw the enemy off balance and allow for a counterattack, as well as restoring Blood Weapon durability. Attacks that do not display a guide cannot be deflected. Use evasion or possession to deal with them.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_032.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_034.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_035.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Blood Time</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully executing consecutive Deflects will activate Blood Time.

<p>
As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month, the company's cause of choice is <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>, a global mental health service that offers confidential support via text message, rather than requiring people talk on the phone. 
</p>
<p>
(And the ususal full disclosure note here, that as of this year Eurogamer now shares a parent company with Humble in IGN Entertainment.)
</p>
<p>
"A gorgeous fantasy journey enlivened by some thrilling rock-climbing," is how Christian Donlan described Don't Nod's excellent puzzle platformer in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Eurogamer's Jusant review</a>. Sadly, the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">did not go on to set tills ringing</a>.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
"A full-on sequel that tells an engrossing new story, even if its combat doesn't quite have the same wow factor," is how Malindy Hetfeld described Atlus' action role-player in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Eurogamer's Persona 5 Strikers review</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has issued a copyright strike against a YouTube channel that reviews emulation handhelds.</p>
<p>The channel in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, describes itself as offering "in-depth reviews and showcases" as well as "emulation setup guides". One of its more recent videos has received a copyright strike from Nintendo, marking a second strike for the channel.</p>
<p>"My Wii U video was taken down and I received another copyright strike, even though this showcase video was no different than all of the tech demos and reviews I have made on this channel previously," Retro Game Corps owner Russ wrote in a statement on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k">YouTube</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-is-now-going-after-youtube-accounts-which-show-its-games-being-emulated">TimeExtension</a>).</p>
<p>Russ is now considering filing a counterclaim as he believes the video "was for educational use, transformative in nature, and had no effect on the market".</p>

<p>"It was a demonstration of a console no longer for sale (even the Wii U eShop is closed, so the company itself has no means of earning revenue from Wii U sales)," Russ said. "However, I am reluctant to open that can of worms with a multi-billion dollar corporation, as their next step would be to file legal action."</p>
<p>The YouTube channel said it will now need to adapt the way it approaches future videos. "I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen, which is a shame because I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations," Russ wrote.</p>
<p>The channel is also going to blur out "any Nintendo game content" on its previous videos as a precaution. That includes "even innocuous content like NES games".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately this is going to delay some video releases - my latest video should be up right now, but instead I have to re-edit and re-upload the video first," Russ closed. "I know this is disappointing news, but with now two strikes on my channel, I don't really have any other choice except to adjust accordingly. Thanks for your understanding."</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-our-company-is-now-financially-sound-gamers-gravitate-towards-live-service-multiplayer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some big announcements for game developers at Unreal Fest Seattle 2024, revealing the new features of Unreal Engine 5 and reducing the royalty fee for games that launch on the Epic Games Store at the same time as other stores.</p>
<p>However, before all these announcements, Epic founder, CEO, and main stakeholder Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGEfQJPqW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> the viewers with an interesting speech. First, he remarked that following <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-founder-explains-massive-layoffs-says-development-and-core-initiatives-are-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's layoffs</a>, Epic is now solid from a financial standpoint and has registered record numbers for Fortnite and the store. Secondly, Sweeney discussed the growing importance of live service multiplayer in an increasingly complex gaming market where even big games may struggle.</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you now that Epic&nbsp;is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong.</em></p>
<p><em>What we're seeing, the real trend here is that players are gravitating towards the really big games where they can play with more of their friends. This is a manifestation of Metcalfe's Law, the idea that the value of a network, a game, or a social experience grows in proportion to the number of friends that you can connect to. In the world of gaming, that means you and your friends getting together and playing games, chatting by voice, attending concerts, and doing all other kinds of cool virtual things online.</em></p>
<p><em>This trend, some people will call it the metaverse. We're not all in agreement on what this means. Some people, when they hear the word metaverse, think of what Facebook is doing with VR and now AR. Some people use the metaverse to describe everything they don't like about the current Fortnite season. But when you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point when he says that an increasing number of players value the live multiplayer experience, it's equally true that several big live service multiplayer games have disappointed badly. Examples include the likes of Crucible, Babylon's Fall, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and most recently, Concord. Not even IPs as powerful as Marvel's and DC's were enough to prevent these failures.&nbsp;As such, while Epic may not be interested in making another single player game for the time being, many other developers certainly are, and they are bound to find success if they create a quality experience.</p>
<p>In other Epic news, Sweeney's company has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> Google and Samsung because of their auto blocker feature.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-mobile-version-in-development-at-pubg-studio.998469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has announced that it's working on a&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation, and that said adaptation will be handled by one of its most prominent studios.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official Krafton website (which is in Korean; we're using machine translation), Krafton's mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>will be handled by PUBG Studios, the division responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>
<p>Krafton says its&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation will "faithfully reinterpret and implement the original's main fun elements to fit the mobile environment" (again, the actual wording is likely to be a touch different, since we're using machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=-f6w-90o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=eMf81_b5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is making its way to mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot we don't yet know about&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s mobile version. It sounds like Krafton will be creating a brand new version of the game rather than just porting the existing version, but beyond that, we're not sure exactly what form&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile will take.</p>
<p>We also don't know when the game will launch for mobiles, nor do we know whether it'll make it out of Krafton's native Korea or not.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it will; after all,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february">hugely popular game</a>, so it would seem rather foolish to restrict its mobile version to one region. Still, the game technically hasn't been announced in the West yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile is a pretty timely one, though. Last week, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">surprise-launched on PS5</a> following a State of Play presentation (although not in Japan, where a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> is currently ongoing between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair and Nintendo).</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a creature-collecting survival game in which the goal is to survive in a world populated by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles"><em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures</a> called Pals.</p>
<p>Although the designs are certainly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the gameplay is more akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>; you must build a base, battle hostile Pals, and decide whether you're going to enslave your Pals to help you build or to treat them as friends.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and we now know that a version of the game is also coming to mobile at some point.

                <p>Until late last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> was slated to be released in November of this year. Ubisoft subsequently made the surprise announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">the game has been delayed to early next year</a>. But according to a new report, this was far from a surprise to Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Shadows. The developers have reportedly been pushing for a delay for months.</p><p>Ubisoft's announcement stated that Shadows' new release date was implemented to give the developers more time to polish the gameplay, and because the company wanted to apply the lessons it learned from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' disappointing rollout--the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">only around 1 million copies thus far</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Gaming</a>'s report states that both of those reasons are true, but adds further context by stating that, "[Assassin's Creed Shadow] is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release."</p><p>There are still adjustments to be made to fix the remaining bugs. However, the larger issues apparently revolve around the desire to shore up the historically accurate aspects of the story. One of the stated reasons for these 11th hour changes is that "historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude." </p><p>At least one silver lining from Ubisoft's latest moves was the decision to reverse the company's stance about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711">releasing new games on consoles and Steam</a> on day one. That was apparently a frequently requested change from some of Ubisoft's employees.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit consoles and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

                <p>A mobile version of the popular game Palworld is in the works, with PUBG company Krafton working out a licensing deal with Pocketpair to bring the game to phones.</p><p>PUBG Studios is developing the mobile version of Palworld, though additional details were not provided in the <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-dlc-constellation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-next-dlc-expansion-will-continue-constellation%E2%80%99s-storyline-%E2%80%93-rumor.998385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-dlc-constellation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Starfield DLC expansion will provide a continuation of the Constellation and Artifact storyline, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264">@Odah_SFA</a>, the next expansion, which should be named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">"Starborn</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,"</a> will be about the disappearance of Constellation's founder, Sebastian Banks, providing a continuation of the organization and the Artifact storyline,</span>&nbsp;which makes up much of the base game's story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OK. So, I've heard some gossip that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starfield</a> 's next Expansion titled "Starborn" will be about the disappearance of Sebastian Banks, Founder of Constellation and the continuation of the Artefact story. Will post more info once I know more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starborn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starborn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bethesda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bethesda</a></p>
<p>— Odahfield (@Odah_SFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As the first Starfield story expansion, Shattered Space, has only just released, it is unlikely we will hear anything about Starborn anytime soon, so it may a while until we learn if the expansion will indeed be more tightly related to the base game's main campaign. Considering how the first expansion is more of a side story, however, it would make sense for Bethesda to go in this direction and explore more of Constellation's origins.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a>, the free-to-play fantasy MMORPG from Korean developer NCSOFT and published by Amazon Games, is off to a big start on Steam--though not quite as big as Amazon's two previous MMOs.</p><p dir="ltr">An early-access period in which players could pay to play five days early saw Throne and Liberty's concurrent player counts peak at around 56,000. On October 1, when the game launched for free-to-play players, those numbers rapidly climbed. Throne of Liberty reached 326,377 concurrent players on launch day and for a time was the fourth most-played game on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dS4OpIWM6U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2dS4OpIWM6U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As often seems to be the case with the launch of a new MMO, server woes and login queues plagued Throne and Liberty in its opening hours, with NCSOFT rapidly spinning up new servers to meet demand. There were also a handful of other issues shortly after launch that NCSOFT said it was working to resolve, including some players being unable to create new characters or missing characters for those who played during early access.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty's Steam launch numbers are nothing to sneeze at, but far behind the launch of Amazon's previous two MMOs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>. New World, internally developed by Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-passes-900000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6496765/" data-ref-id="1100-6496765">broke Steam records when it launched in 2021</a> and saw more than 913,000 concurrent players despite its $40 price tag. Lost Ark, another free-to-play Korean MMO localized and published by Amazon, fared even better during its launch in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-ark-passes-1-3-million-concurrents-overtakes-cyberpunk-2077-dota-2-and-cs-go-to-become-steams-2nd-biggest-game-of-all-time/1100-6500630/" data-ref-id="1100-6500630">hitting 1.3 million concurrent players</a>. It is worth noting that unlike Lost Ark or New World, Throne and Liberty is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, meaning that its Steam concurrent players don't paint the full picture.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon prior to launch detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/being-a-free-player-in-amazons-new-mmo-wont-be-quite-so-rough-thanks-to-new-changes/1100-6525061/" data-ref-id="1100-6525061">all the changes it would be making to Throne and Liberty compared to the Korean version</a>, with the goal of adjusting the game's business model to better fit the expectations of Western players. Those changes included lowering the price of the game's battle pass and leveling pass, as well as additional rewards and the removal of an optional subscription called the Blessing of Solisium. Amazon said it would "evaluate" how the subscription needed to change in order to "serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty wasn't even going to be the only MMORPG Amazon published in 2024. The juggernaut also planned to publish the Western version of Bandai Namco's anime MMO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-499449">Blue Protocol</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">Western release of Blue Protocol was canceled in August</a>, with the Japanese servers set to go offline in January.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if Amazon has a reputation for creating and publishing MMOs (it's currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-lotr-mmo/1100-6526064/" data-ref-id="1100-6526064">working on a Lord of the Rings MMO</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-revamps-the-mmo-for-consoles-with-solo-play-and-more-changes/1100-6524219/" data-ref-id="1100-6524219">reworking New World for consoles</a>), the company is looking to branch out into other genres. It was announced as part of Gamescom 2024 that Amazon would publish the co-op dungeon crawler <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/king-of-meat/" data-ref-id="5000-640430">King of Meat</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunners-pounce-on-glitch-that-lets-you-beat-game-in-an-hour<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> features an eye-opening glitch that lets you teleport to the game's final boss, allowing speedrunners to beat the whole adventure in under an hour. 
</p>
<p>
The exploit, which warps protagonist Zelda to Echoes of Wisdom's final dungeon, skips the vast majority of the new Nintendo Switch game. 
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, Zelda's speedrunning community has seized on the glitch to massively boost completition times - though it is unclear how long the exploit will stick around. 
</p>
<p>
"It's now possible to [warp] from after you beat the first dungeon to the final dungeon (although it softlocks)," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1ft6tfr/echoes_of_wisdom_game_breaking_glitch_discovered/">reddit</a> user xIceblue wrote, on a post which shows the exploit's method in detail. 
</p>
<p>
"So we found a way to [warp] to right before, fight the boss there, and proceed into the final area. That flag apparently removes the softlock, and allows us to beat the game with four hearts."
</p>
<p>
Footage posted by xIceblue, embedded below, shows the game's Echo ability being manipulated using a method that involves dropping signposts on top of trees, until multiple menus overlap on top of one another. This is clearly not intended behaviour. From here, users can open up the game's world map and simply drop Zelda down to near Echoes of Wisdom's finale.
</p>
<p>This should go without saying, but you should not watch the footage of someone warping to the game's final area if you do not wish to see the game's final area.</p>

Over on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Zelda speedrunner <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/onakutv">Onaku</a> has already posted an "any%" completion of the game at just 52 minutes (which you can watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMPUrSFLQW4">YouTube</a>), but isn't stopping there. Onaku is currently streaming now, at the time of writing, and aiming to get that time even lower - at under 50 minutes.
</p>
<p>
It'll be interesting to see if this exploit lasts, or whether Nintendo patches it out in an upcoming update. 
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Eurogamer's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>'s third season is here, but its Steam debut has failed to entice players back to the game.</p>
<p>Season three of Rocksteady's misfit co-op shooter arrived yesterday, 1st October, bringing new playable character Zoe Lawton with it. This season also lands players back in Gotham, but not as we have seen it before.</p>

<p>"In this Elseworld, Earth held its last stand against Brainiac in Gotham City, rather than Metropolis," read <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-of-lawless-available-october-1">season three's notes</a>. "And after it fell, Brainiac decided he had little use for the failing city, leaving it to fall into the void."</p>
<p>All of this has left rivers of lava to pour through the city, and so on. Other additions this season include new gear and a number of bug fixes.</p>
<p>However, it seems not many people are really interested in seeing this version of DC's iconic city. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/">SteamDB</a>, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had a 24-hour player peak of just 248.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the time of writing, there are just 144 Steam players in the game.</p>

<p>It's no secret Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League didn't take off with the success developer Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed in July which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">Warner Bros. reported a 41 percent fall in gaming revenue year-on-year</a> due to the "weak performance" of Suicide Squad. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Layoffs were then confirmed at Rocksteady last month</a>, with the game's underperformance a reason for this "restructuring".</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">fourth season of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> still appears to be on the cards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-not-40-percent-complete/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, it was widely reported that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, the second entry in the series by Kojima Production, is only around 30,40 percent complete but is still targeting 2025. However, there's the chance that the development of the game could be in a more advanced state.</p>
<p>As reported by multiple users on X, it seems like the 30, 40 percent figure mentioned by Hideo Kojima during last week's Tokyo Game Show event may not be related to the actual development of the game or the Japanese voiceover recording. Kojima-san mentioned it while talking about his current work on balancing parts of the game the individual teams have done, so it could be that he is 30, 40 percent done with this balancing work rather than the entire game, which wouldn't make much sense for a game that is, at worst, only 14 months away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The headline is wrong.</p>
<p>The community note too.</p>
<p>Kojima says that he’s currently balancing the parts of the game the individual teams have done. He just says 30-40% mid sentence, whether that’s 30-40% they’ve finished, he’s finished, or how much it makes up the game isn’t clear. <a href="https://t.co/kydK2tHfvM">https://t.co/kydK2tHfvM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Fe7ku1rMUo">pic.twitter.com/Fe7ku1rMUo</a></p>
<p>— Marcus (@Vamplosion) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vamplosion/status/1841268266762915970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In many ways, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set to outdo the previous entry in the series in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">lot of different ways</a>. Not only the game's Photo Mode will be wild and will influence the story of the game in some ways, but there will also be animated in-game concerts featuring actual artists.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/">2025</a> on PlayStation 5. A PC version of the game has yet to be announced, though it is likely it will be released around one year after the game's debut on console.</p>

            <p>Despite just releasing yesterday, Amazon and NCSOFT’s massively mate-filled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne And Liberty</a> has already shot right up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429640/THRONE_AND_LIBERTY/">Steam</a>’s most played charts. It's sitting just behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Black Myth: Wukong</a> at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banana-game">Banana</a>'s level, mind.</p>

<p>Set in a medieval fantasy world of knights, goblins, and very large lads made of rock dispatched solely for the purpose of destroying other things made of rocks, Throne And Liberty’s trick is it lets you transform into beasts like fish and birds to aid with travel, or even the massive golems shown in the trailer above. My research tells me you can then smash down castle walls during massive sieges. Or, as shown in the header image, literally carry your party. That’s fun! What happens if you then do a dancing emote, I wonder? Do they all fall to their death, or simply cling on to gargantuan, boogying form?</p>
<p>The golems are a great selling point, although it seems to take a good long while to get to that point - further exacerbated by the primary flavour of player gripes at the moment, which are targeted at long queue times and microtransactions. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-rushes-steam-charts">spotted by Ian Games</a>, some players are spending up to 45 minutes creating a character, then getting disconnected. There’s also some freshly introduced issues with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, apparently brought on by the anti-cheat. I believe James, who long ago replaced three of his favourite limbs with Steam Decks, is looking into this as we speak.</p>
<p>As for positives - and a lot of folk are clearly enjoying themselves - it’s apparently quite the looker in action, and both combat and questing are getting some compliments, too. There are also no set classes. Instead, you’ll switch roles by switching weapons. The main question I have before considering any MMO is this: is this going to be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> where I’m having a really nice time until I have to do dungeons with other players then get really nervous about whether I’m performing my role in the party correctly? What if someone is watching the specific combination of attacks I’m using and thinks it’s stupid and suboptimal? I can’t deal with this. I can’t deal with it all. That’s not so much a question as it is a minor spiral into the depths of my fractious psyche, but that’s the MMO experience for me. Let me know if this one is a bit more chill than, uh, the famously chill FF14.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games has announced that VALORANT will move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by SVP and Head of&nbsp;VALORANT&nbsp;Studios, Anna Donlan, who said “we [Riot Games] have squeezed literally every ounce of everything we could get out of UE 4, so now we make the move to UE5, and that is not an easy feat when your game is a live service game but it is necessary.”</p>



<p>Donlon continued, “This upgrade is not going to significantly change how Valorant looks or performs, at least not right away.”</p>



<p>Donlon went on to tease that developers are “very excited what about UE5 can do for us [Riot Games] in the future” and that “maybe those devs are working on something I can’t talk about and maybe those devs are thinking about ways to expand the Val universe into new playable experiences.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It remains to be seen what these “new playable experiences” are, but such comments are sure to get the Valorant community speculating on the possibilities.</p>



<p>For now though, Valorant continues to be a huge success for Riot Games since its release in June 2020. Last year, it was revealed that Valorant has 28 million players, 70% of which are Gen Z.</p>



<p>What do you think of Valorant moving to Unreal Engine 5? And what do you think what these “new experiences” are? Let us know in&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>!</p>

            <p>
Pre-orders for the limited edition PlayStation 5 30th Anniversary range will come with an extra layer of scalper protection in Japan, Sony has said, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-bundles-already-selling-for-thousands-on-ebay">the rampant relisting of consoles with exorbitant prices on eBay</a> seen elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Japanese PlayStation fans <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ja-jp/local/campaigns/ps5-30th-register-to-pre-order/">can now place pre-orders</a> for the 30th Anniversary collection but require a PlayStation Network account with at least 30 hours' worth of play to be eligible. This is different to the method elsewhere, where any PSN account could be used.
</p>
<p>
In Japan, fans have far longer to register a pre-order - from now until midnight on Monday 14th October - to reduce queuing issues.

<p>
After that time, all eligible pre-orders will be placed into a lottery system to give every potential customer a fair chance (if the number of pre-orders ends up exceeding the amount of stock, which is of course inevitable).
</p>
<p>
Any stock not bought by lottery winners will then be entered into a "re-lottery" in late November, with unsuccessful pre-order customers from the first round given another shot. 
</p>
<p>
It all seems a far fairer and more straightforward system than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-bundle-priced-960-sells-out-in-seconds">the one used in the UK and US, where customers saw consoles sold out in seconds</a> - if they could get through the wobbly queuing process at all.

Another check of eBay listings here in the UK today shows dozens of recently-sold PS5 30th Edition console pre-orders that have changed hands, the vast majority in the low thousands of pounds - a markup by scalpers of around double to quadruple the console's original price.

			<p>A new God of War Ragnarok patch is now live for the PC version of the game, improving AMD FSR 3 frame generation and fixing a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Patch 4 focuses on fixing several issues, including crashes, authentication flow, and texture issues, which will no longer unload while looking at the menu for a set amount of time and won't be shown loading in while using fast travel through the Realm Between Realms.</p>
<p>The new God of War Ragnarok patch also fixes an NVIDIA memory leak issue caused by switching between different Frame Generation settings. The patch, as mentioned above, also brings some AMD FSR 3 frame generation improvements, fixing flickering in the pause menu, performance and frame pacing issues, and a small memory leak caused by turning it on and off. Rounding up the changes brought by the patch, which can be found detailed in full<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2322010/view/4681018807420990578?l=english"> here</a>, are Steam Deck offline mode and DualSense controller fixes.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok finally launched on PC last month after almost two years since its console release, and the port is definitely a solid one, although it has some <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-worse-playstation-5/">issues</a> that make it not look as good as the PlayStation 5 version. The port also doesn't offer many options to scale beyond the PS5 version's Quality Mode.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"> review.</a></p>

Epic Games is now "financially sound" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">shedding around 830 staff during last year's mass layoff</a>, founder Tim Sweeney has said. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking last night during a stage presentation at Unreal Fest, Sweeney briefly acknowledged the job losses as the show opened, before going on to mention last year's high watermark of engagement with the hugely-lucrative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, that featured a massively successful throwback "OG" season. 
</p>
<p>
"Last year's Unreal Fest began with some sad news," Sweeney said. "The company had to get its finances in order, and we just had some major layoffs. We spent the last year rebuilding and also really executing solidly on all fronts.

"I'm happy to tell you now that the company is financially sound, and that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Fortnite player numbers have dropped back down since then, and the launch of last year's new modes have had mixed success, though <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in particular remains popular.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games remains hugely busy, with ongoing work across the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and its UEFN toolset for building and launching games in Fortnite, the growth of Epic Game Store, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">fresh legal battle announced this week with Google and Samsung</a>.
</p>
<p>
On UEFN, new modes developed by Epic Games using the technology for Fortnite were mentioned - an all-new experience set to arrive in the game this year, and a new version of the popular Fortnite Reload mode, due in the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
And on the Epic Game Store, a new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" offer will trim Epic's existing royalty from five to 3.5 percent from 1st January 2025, to incentivise launching on its storefront. This will apply to games available on Epic's platform first or at the same time as other platforms such as Steam.
