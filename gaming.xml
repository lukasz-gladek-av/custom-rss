            <p>If your game isn't fun or feasible, kill it.</p>
<p>That's the advice of Free Lives' Dominique Gawlowski, Ant Workshop's Tony Gowland, and indie game developer and consultant Rami Ismail, who have banded together to share their experience on lowering game development costs for our new GI Sprint series of videos, podcasts, and articles about making games cheaper, faster, and better.</p>
<p>In this candid discussion about bringing game ideas to life (and knowing when it's time to kill them off), our panel emphasised that despite lower barriers to entry, increased costs, competition, and challenges mean game-making is harder than ever before.</p>
<p>With unprecedented job losses and studio closures, it's more crucial than ever to ensure your team doesn't waste time or money chasing projects that won't generate a return. Here's everything you need to know about failing fast and learning from every defeat.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">If it's not working, stop working – sooner rather than later</h2>
<p>When's the best time to abandon a game? Gawlowski's advice is succinct: "As soon as possible."</p>
<p>While it may be difficult to trust your gut when you're starting out, the panel universally agreed that you need to give yourself a hard and fast deadline – say, a month of prototyping time – after which you decide whether to commit to a project or move on.</p>
<p>"If it isn't fun to play for five minutes, then we're done. We move on to the next one. And that's still what I teach," Ismail says.</p>
<p>"That's still what I do when I make my own games. If we can't make it fun in a week, two weeks, then we're not sure there's something at the core, and it's time to move on."</p>
<p>Gowland agrees: "You need to have that hard and fast kind of cut-off. No, you can't just keep iterating on that. And you can't just keep throwing new things at it.</p>
<p>"Very much from the outset, we've set out with: 'This has to be something that we can make'. If no publishers are interested in it, we don't want to be in a situation where we've spent six months of our time and money building something. If we can't get extra money in, it has to stop."</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Is it fun to play <em>and</em> to make?</h2>
<p>As for how you know when a game is working or not? Well, everyone – and every game – is a little different, but Ismail thinks it all comes down to one thing: fun.</p>
<p>"There's two things I look for," he says. "The first part is: do people have fun interacting with it? If they get excited about what the game could be, those are indicators that we look for. It's not a science, it's very much a feeling thing.</p>
<p>"The other part that we look for is this – is it fun to make? It's a really big part of the equation.</p>
<p>"Assuming a game takes two to three years, if you calculate the amount of time I have left before I'm 65… I don't have that many," he continues. "So I also want to make sure that at that point, it's fun to work on it – and that takes a little bit longer."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Don't waste time on the nice-to-haves while you ignore the must-haves…</h2>
<p>Ismail also advises to focus in priority on the core aspects of your game, things you can't do without, without getting lost in details that could be figured out later down the line.</p>
<p>"When people are coming into the games industry, they very often are married to this thing, such as fighting a dragon with a sword," Ismail says. "So what they'll do is they'll stretch out the part of getting there, and they'll focus on all the wrong things, like making it very beautiful or writing out the lore book for the entire story…</p>
<p>"And then when they get to the point where they actually have to programme they realise, 'Oh, actually, this doesn't work'. They're six months or a year in, and they're chasing this North Star of a thing that, frankly, they could have tested in two days."</p>
<p>Instead, he suggests you focus on the fun and how your game can get there.</p>
<p>"Can I make it fun to hit the rectangle on a big square? If yes, then we can probably do the dragon thing. If no, then we probably can't do the dragon thing, and we should figure out what to do with it."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">…or time-sink features that just aren't working for you or your game</h2>
<p>An effective way of ascertaining what does and doesn't work is to prototype your ideas. Not only will it help you identify what is and isn't within your team's skillset and comfort, but it can also help you iterate and develop early concepts.</p>
<p>"Prototyping doesn't have to be a whole game at once, or a whole game idea at once," Gowland says. "It's like prototyping features. And if that feature doesn't work, either get rid of it or think of a different approach that has a <em>similar</em> kind of result as what you're after, and then see whether that version works better."</p>
<p>Ismail agrees, emphasising the need for features to always have a purpose.</p>
<p>"The further into development you go, the more expensive it becomes to fix things because we're building houses of cards. So the 'one-way doors' [the idea that if you commit to an idea or feature, you may not be able to come back] are super important when it comes to features.</p>
<p>"Sure, sometimes things change very last minute. It's game development – we're not going to pretend there's a perfect way of doing this. But at that point, triage becomes a really big thing… but I think that's an entirely separate Sprint episode!"</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Check and check again that your idea is worth investing your time and money in</h2>
<p>But even if you ensure your idea is fun to make and full of purposeful features your players will adore, ultimately, there's no point chasing projects that aren't worth your time and cash investment.</p>
<p>"It takes two to three years to make a game," Gawlowski says, admitting Free Lives has abandoned early prototypes with 20,000 external downloads because they were either not affordable or time-effective enough to take into full development. "So you better be extremely sure that this is something you want to spend your life on.</p>
<p>"The top 10% of games on Steam are pretty much the ones making all the money on Steam. The rest of that 90% aren't making any money, and are from studios that are either closing or have lost a considerable amount of money, or probably never will make games again. This is why you have to be damn sure your ideas are good, because what you're aiming for is to be in that top 10%. You have to be in [there] if you want to continue to make games. There's no time to be wasted, you know, sitting on an idea and refusing to surrender that this idea is possibly not a top 10% idea.</p>
<p>"And you'd be amazed at how impossible it is for some people. To their own detriment, they will hang a noose around their neck with this terrible idea before sitting down and actually going, okay, maybe I should move on. People are just so married to their concepts."</p>
<p>Gawlowski likens video game development to the music industry – where she started her career – especially as "more kids use software that makes it absolutely doable for them to make a playable game," encouraging a "fierce competitiveness."</p>
<p>"There's still room for beautiful games to come in and do well," she adds. "They're not making the multi – <em>multi </em>– hundreds of millions of dollars that may be a game like Call of Duty is making, but there's still that gentle curve of doing well enough to possibly fund your own next project, where you can become self-sustaining, manage your business with a level of certainty that you have a future release for the next couple of years, and make more beautiful games."</p>
<blockquote>"You'd be amazed at how impossible it is for some people to surrender an idea. People are just so married to their concepts"<cite>Dominique Gawlowski</cite></blockquote>
<p>Gowland adds: "Making more smaller bets rather than putting all of your eggs into one big, expensive basket is a much better approach to things."</p>
<p>He points to Zeekerss' Lethal Company, which managed to find great success despite everything that is going on in the industry.</p>
<p>"It's successful because it has done something a bit different and given people something new," he continues. "But it didn't have [or] need the same budget as Call of Duty or as an Assassin's Creed, or any of that kind of thing.</p>
<p>"Giving people something new and doing something that's cool and appeals to a bunch of people doesn't necessarily need a two million dollar budget... For me personally, I think that's where a lot of developers should be heading. Let's try more smaller things and see what hits.</p>
<p>"Our last game, Dungeon Golf? We spent a couple of years making that and, I'll be honest, it completely tanked when it came out. And it's like, 'Okay, well, we can't do that again'. That approach? It's just not sustainable."</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Make smaller games and know your niche</h2>
<p>Setting realistic expectations is crucial to failing fast, especially if you promise too much.</p>
<p>Ismail reflects on the fact even industry veterans aren't immune to failure, for instance senior developers who broke away from their AAA studios to go it alone, only to stumble at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>"They all fail – but making small things is absolutely the right answer right now… And we don't mean small games in that they're short to play," he clarifies. "We mean games that are easier to compartmentalise, to develop in a way that is fast and allows you to test quickly.</p>
<p>"If you look at a lot of the hits right now, you'll see small, elegant systems. At the heart of it is something that you can prototype fairly quickly. And then when it works, they start spending time on it until it builds to something really good, or something really interesting.</p>
<p>"If you want to do something really complicated, and you have the space to be self-funded, or you can get a publisher to do it? Go for it. There's not that much competition in that space, because it's a <em>hard</em> space. But for the average indie developer now? I think that's the right answer. And then you can always figure out what you're doing, you know, like early access, or live development. I love the strategy of just putting it on Itch.io. If people respond to it, you immediately have feedback – you immediately have a direction."</p>
<blockquote>"Every right decision you're making is not buying you success, it's buying you a coin flip. And then at the end, you flip it"<cite>Rami Ismail</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Gowland stresses the importance of knowing your niche: "I think that's why the survival stuff really exploded recently. Get that core bit of gameplay, and then <em>after</em> that, it's extra content in terms of monsters, passives, and your abilities and stuff like that. But it's so systemic to build on top of that. And very quickly, you can end up with a game you can spend 200 hours of your time on.</p>
<p>"I think if you're making smaller things, or the development costs are lower, you don't have to appeal to the same size of audience that Call of Duty has to appeal to in order to recoup [development expenses].</p>
<p>"If your version of survival is you're on a farm, and you're a weird frog… maybe you only need 20,000 people to be into that, and, well, that's way more achievable than however many copies of COD Microsoft needs to sell this winter."</p>
<h2 id="section-7">Even when you do everything right, things may still go wrong</h2>
<p>But even if you choose to follow every last bit of the advice given here today, be mindful that <em>nothing</em> can guarantee success.</p>
<p>In fact, the only guarantee you have is eventual failure. How you take that failure and learn from it, though? That's the part that matters.</p>
<p>"I think you can see from having listened to everyone speak that failing fast is not only a good idea, it's the <em>only</em> idea you should be sticking with when running a small studio," Gawlowski says.</p>
<p>But even if you do everything right, success is never guaranteed.</p>
<p>"We're never buying certainty. We are entrepreneurs, which means we're taking risks," Ismail concludes.</p>
<p>"Even with everything aligned – with the best processes, making sure you test your game on Itch.io, get a publisher, build the game efficiently, quickly, prototype... you know, break eggs, make omelettes, develop the game carefully, make it well, make it expandable, modular; whatever way you do it. I tell my team, you're buying points. You're buying coins. At the end of the whole journey, you get to flip the coins. And if more than ten, 15, 20 of the coins land on heads, you might make enough money. So every right decision you're making is not buying you success, it's buying you a coin flip. And then at the end, you flip it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/20/cat-quest-3-preview-a-purrfectly-piratical-adventure/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Do you like games littered with cat puns? Are you paw-sitively tickled by even a whisker of floof-related humour? And do action RPGs have you bapping your controller’s buttons with glee? Then the Cat Quest games are absolutely for you, and Cat Quest 3 will probably have you headbutting people’s ankles in joy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - Release Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5TQm1N8vuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The adventure begins with a tiny kitten with a strange birthmark surviving a battle at sea in the Purribean archipelago, the Pi-rat attack sinking the ship and our baby hero floating away in a little wicker basket, only to be discovered by the spirit of a cat, Cap’n Spirry, who decides to foster the child through to adulthood. Thankfully, since we’re talking about cats here, that probably only takes a few weeks before the feisty feline is old enough to set forth and seek his destiny and hunt down the mythical Northern Star.</p>


<p>As with previous games, this is a fast and fluid action RPG that’s easy to dip into and start battling through. It feels like you’re adventuring across a 90s RPG overworld, but instead of random encounters cutting away to battle, you can run up to and start swiping at enemies meandering on the world map. Of course you can also arrive at various locations and head inside, whether it’s a tavern for a chat with Mama Milka the bartender and to pick up bounties, or a Pi-rat infested tower, a small cave or some other style of dungeon which promises treasure at the end –&nbsp;these are either explored in the familiar isometric view, or switch to a side-scrolling 2D camera.</p>


<p>This piratical twist is the root of how Cat Quest 3 differs from the first two. Starting off on a small island, you’ll have to battle a few of the Pi-rats, building up to a first encounter with the oversized Mr. Clean. With Mr. Clean’s ground-pounding attack, you’ll need to dodge roll out of the way, or swap to and blast away with a blunderbuss from distance to defeat him.</p>
<p>Naturally, as you defeat enemies and open up chests in dungeons, you’ll snap up loot that will enhance your kitty cat attacks. Better swords, different guns that can be faster firing and/or more damaging, hats, bandanas and other headgear, spells to learn and trinkets to wear. This gear can imbue you with new abilities, whether it’s unleashing a fireball or giving you a dodge-attack that lets you dive up close to an enemy and immediately start swiping, instead of sauntering up and potentially taking damage yourself.</p>

<p>All the Pi-rats defeated on that opening island, you’ll be able to snatch control of the ship just off the island’s jetty and take to the high seas for yourself – you can always hop out of your ship when you get to land, but finding a jetty or harbour will let you summon it to appear right beside you. The world feels nice and open to you at this very early stage – there’s something about having a boat and lots of open water that does that – though your goal and direction to head in your quest is nicely signposted in the world with star towers.</p>
<p>Sailing the seas of the Purribean, you’ll run into innumerable Pi-rat ships and have to do battle. Just like the on-land combat, it’s light and accessible with a good bit of auto-aim in the general direction you’re facing and intuitive controls as you try to get to the flanks of your enemies –&nbsp;cannon towers on islands pose a somewhat different challenge to figure out.</p>

<p>If all of that sounds pawsitively delightful to you, then there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">a demo on Steam for Cat Quest 3</a>, and obviously the first two games, which are currently steeply discounted on PC. The full game will launch on 8th August – International Cat Day –&nbsp;across all major consoles, smartphones and PC.</p>

            <p>PlayStation has confirmed to Eurogamer it will be skipping Gamescom once again this year.</p>
<p>The annual German event is the highest attended gaming convention in the world, and a key date in the gaming calendar - a chance for developers and publishers to showcase their wares.
</p>
<p>
Sony, however, has skipped the event in recent years, favouring its own dedicated PlayStation showcases, and that trend continues in 2024. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Sony spokesperson said: "We currently have no plans to exhibit at Gamescom 2024."</p>

<p>Sony showcased some of its upcoming PlayStation slate last month, in a State of Play broadcast featuring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2's remake</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord</a>, and a new Astro Bot title aptly called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot</a>. Our Chris recently spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-channels-the-pure-game-design-of-nintendo-as-playstation-turns-towards-families">Team Asobi studio founder and Astro Bot creative director Nicolas Doucet</a> about the release, which is set to launch on PS5 this September.</p>
<p>As for Gamescom, PlayStation isn't the only company that won't be present during August's convention. In April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">Nintendo also confirmed it would be skipping the show</a>.</p>
<p>"Gamescom is a great event, and each year we evaluate whether Nintendo should participate or not," a Nintendo UK spokesperson told Eurogamer. "After careful consideration from all perspectives, we've made the decision not to be present at Gamescom 2024. Players will have opportunities to try out Nintendo Switch games at other events throughout the year."</p>

            <p>We’re less than a day now from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>’s launch, and as promised, FromSoft have just released the latest patch (notes <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">here</a>) for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>. It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-youre-waiting-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring-has-some-free-hair-for-you">were announced last week</a>. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psa-please-leave-my-horrible-silver-frog-sons-alone-as-you-grind-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Albinuaric murdering community</a>: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.</p>
<p>Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.</p>

<p>“Added new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle,” declares the item as if it’s no big deal. Some context: The fight against Elden Beast is a low point in what’s otherwise an interesting run of bosses during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>’s final stretch. The actual creature itself is a gorgeous and deeply strange Ghibli-esque ink dragon. But the boss arena is huge, and the beast likes to teleport around it, making for agonizing sprints back and forth as you try to keep up. This, alongside certain attacks that look as if they’re designed to be hopped over with Torrent, has lead to speculation that this fight was always meant to be beaten mounted, but for whatever reason, your steed wasn’t summonable in the release version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. It’s an incredibly welcome change, in other words.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the patch are the following headline changes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Added support for the SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE DLC.</li>
<li>Five new hairstyles have been added to the game. They can be selected during character creation, using the Clouded Mirror Stand or using Rennala's Rebirth feature.</li>
<li>Added "Map Functions Menu" to the Map Menu.</li>
<li>Active Summoning Pools will now be carried over to NG+.</li>
<li>Individual Summoning Pools can now be enabled / disabled in the newly added Map Functions Menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Inventory features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Newly obtained items will be marked with a "!“.</li>
<li>A new tab called "Recent Items" has been added to review recently obtained items.</li>
<li>Display settings can be changed from the Display tab in the system menu.</li>
<li>Added new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast the boss battle.</li>
<li>Added new feature to the colosseum: crafted consumable items that have been used during a battle will be replenished at the end of your session.</li>
<li>Added support for Arabic language.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The patch also includes the following Steam only changes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>New Keyboard/mouse settings:</li>
<li>Added "lock-on change threshold" setting of mouse controls.</li>
<li>Added a setting to change cursor movement behaviour in the map menu.</li>
<li>Added key assignments to open the map in the Key Settings menu.</li>
</ul></blockquote><p>

Alongside this are various other balance changes to weapons, ashes of war, and great runes, both PvP specific and in general. Shadow Of The Erdtree itself just got a new launch trailer today, which you can find below. Fair warning though: it's not shy about spoiling what look to be several bosses.

<p>“The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls,” wrote Edders in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow Of The Erdtree review</a>, “but I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.” You should read the full thing though. It contains the phrase “fuckery per capita.”</p>

Work on The Hundred Line was then restarted but what began as an "indie scale game" quickly grew and demanded more funds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"We decided to take the plunge and take out a loan," Kodaka said, a move which is unusual for game developers who are traditionally funded by publishers.

"Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.'</p></div><p>The combat in Veilguard has been a hot topic of discussion ever since the game’s reveal earlier this month. As IGN said in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview">Veilguard preview</a>, this is more of an action game than any previous entry in the fantasy RPG series.</p><p>“The battle system reduces the party size from four to three and in so doing becomes more action forward than ever,” we said. Combat revolves around dodging, countering, and using risk-reward charge attacks designed to break enemy armor layers.</p><p>Much of the strategy comes from the ability wheel, which stops the action either by tapping or holding the shoulder button and lets you issue orders. Companions can be kitted out as support units and healers, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>“The combat system is an interesting challenge going into the fourth iteration of this game because as you know, every Dragon Age has reinvented combat to some degree,” director Corinne Busche told IGN.</p><p>“Of course, pause and play strategy is always the backbone of it. But what that means is that, in addition to fans of all three prior games and welcoming in an entirely new generation of fans, we've got a pretty diverse player base to accommodate to.”</p><p>Veilguard launches 10 years after the last game in the series, Inquisition, came out, and 15 years after the first game, Origins. Earlier this month BioWare fully revealed Veilguard <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">alongside its new name</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-character-creator-details">new info on the character creator</a> and an extended look at gameplay.

<p><em>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.</em></p>
<p>That simple sentence first appeared on a PDP-10 mainframe in the 1970s, and the words marked the beginning of what we now know as interactive fiction.</p>
<p>From the bare-bones text adventures of the 1980s to the heartfelt hypertext works of Twine creators, interactive fiction is an art form that continues to inspire a loyal audience. The community for interactive fiction, or IF, attracts readers and players alongside developers and creators. It champions an open source ethos and a punk-like individuality.</p>
<p>But whatever its production value or artistic merit, at heart, interactive fiction is simply words on a screen. In this time of AAA video games, prestige television, and contemporary novels and poetry, how does interactive fiction continue to endure?
</p><p>To understand the history of IF, the best place to turn for insight is the authors themselves. Not just the authors of notable text games—although many of the people I interviewed for this article do have that claim to fame—but the authors of the communities and the tools that have kept the torch burning. Here's what they had to say about IF and its legacy.</p>
<h2>Examine roots: Adventure and Infocom</h2>
<p>The interactive fiction story began in the 1970s. The first widely played game in the genre was <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>, also known simply as <i>Adventure</i>. The text game was made by Will Crowther in 1976, based on his experiences spelunking in Kentucky’s aptly named Mammoth Cave. Descriptions of the different spaces would appear on the terminal, then players would type in two-word commands—a verb followed by a noun—to solve puzzles and navigate the sprawling in-game caverns.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>During the 1970s, getting the chance to interact with a computer was a rare and special thing for most people.</p>
<p>"My father's office had an open house in about 1978," IF author and tool creator Andrew Plotkin recalled. "We all went in and looked at the computers—computers were very exciting in 1978—and he fired up <i>Adventure</i> on one of the terminals. And I, being eight years old, realized this was the best thing in the universe and immediately wanted to do that forever."</p>
<p>"It is hard to overstate how potent the effect of this game was," said Graham Nelson, creator of the Inform language and author of the landmark IF <i>Curses</i>, of his introduction to the field. "Partly that was because the behemoth-like machine controlling the story was itself beyond ordinary human experience."
</p><p>Perhaps that extraordinary factor is what sparked the curiosity of people like Plotkin and Nelson to play <i>Adventure</i> and the other text games that followed. The roots of interactive fiction are entangled with the roots of the computing industry. "I think it's always been a focus on the written word as an engine for what we consider a game," said software developer and tech entrepreneur Liza Daly. "Originally, that was born out of necessity of primitive computers of the '70s and '80s, but people discovered that there was a lot to mine there."</p>
<p>Home computers were just beginning to gain traction as Stanford University student Don Woods released his own version of <i>Adventure</i> in 1977, based on Crowther’s original Fortran work. Without wider access to comparatively pint-sized machines like the Apple 2 and the Vic-20, Scott Adams might not have found an audience for his own text adventure games, released under his company Adventure International, in another homage to Crowther. As computers spread to more people around the world, interactive fiction was able to reach more and more readers.</p>

<p data-characters="213" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC just hours away, FromSoftware has dropped the <em>Elden</em> <em>Ring</em> v1.12 patch notes, preparing the game for the expansion while also making plenty of weapon adjustments for PvP gameplay. </p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadow of</em> <em>the Erdtree</em></a> is <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s first and only expansion, so it’s no surprise that fans are eagerly anticipating its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/heres-when-you-can-start-playing-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-every-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on June 20</a>. Before we can get our hands on it and jump back into the Land’s Between, FromSoftware has dropped the v1.12 patch to help prepare the game for the expansion, add new features like hairstyles, and upgraded the Summoning Pool and your inventory to make them more useful too. </p>

            <p>“The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/republic-of-pirates">Republic Of Pirates</a> was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, out today with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103470/Republic_of_Pirates/">demo on Steam</a> at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the resource-chaining of it all, I’d like to draw your attention to the naval combat itself, since that’s the feature that makes the best use of the piratey theme. Combat itself is a familiar RTS blow-trader, though with low numbers of units. However, in possibly the most elaborate and pleasing unit bark I’ve ever heard, your ships sing full shanty verses when you select them. They’re not just one bloke in a cupboard with a USB mic and a bottle of Captain Morgan’s either. We’re talking layered harmonies and full-arsed pipemanship. What’s a slight bummer is that this is the most considered and interesting thing about the ships, at least the ones in the opening hours. There’s no real considerations around navigation or facing, although each class of ship does have a hotkey ability. The starting sloop, for example, gets a cone-AEO shot.</p>
<p>After you’ve taken down a ship, you can gather resources from the wreckage, and this is where the bulk of the clicking begins. You make land, you plonk down a port, and this becomes your hub, since you’ll need to connect every other building to the same road network. The basic economy is a circular system. You need workers for resources to build ships, workers who want booze and fish and brothels and the bloody moon on a stick, as per. You provide those, you upgrade your houses, allowing for more complex jobs with different resources to build better ships. Some resources like wood and fish are gathered from the map. Some, like cotton for sails and sugar for booze, you’ll have to plant fields of. Depot workers ease along the supply chain from one link to another. It’s low stress, leaving you more time to enjoy the jaunty and elaborate soundtrack, or gaze upon the very pretty water as it sparkles in the sun, like a glass eye somebody dropped in the toilet.</p>
<p>My own personal enthusiasm for the game can likely be gleaned from the fact that I was planning on writing a chunkier impressions piece, but now reckon I’ve had my fill with the demo. But there’s a silver lining here, since the complexity I’d hoped for not being present has revealed a much lighter and easy-going builder that I imagine some of you might be in the mood for. A freshly plucked pearl from a slightly emaciated oyster, then, and your own opportunity to be the Bastard City mayor you want to see in the world.</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features as well as PvP and PvE, weapons balance changes and more.</p>
<p>The 1.12, which introduces support for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, introduces some welcome quality-of-life changes, such as new map functions and new inventory features, such as a new "Recent Items" tab that allows the user to quickly list all recently obtained items. A new big change is the ability to summon the spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.</p>
<p>Alongside these new features, the latest Elden Ring patch also introduced PvP and PvE balance changes as well as weapons, skills, and Incantations adjustments. General balance adjustments for both PvP and PvE are included in the patch, increasing the speed of certain attacks for Axes, Greataxes, Hammers, Flails, and Reapers, increasing the damage of Whips, and more. Full patch notes can be found on Bandai Namco's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-Patch-112">official website.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion launching later today with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

But if you look over it and give me an estimate there’s a chance I wouldn’t cancel it.”</p><p>Cain said he played the prototype for two hours and asked the development team a number of questions before delivering his verdict to the vice president.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/screenshot-2024-06-20-103741-1718876295567.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tim Cain. Image credit: YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I said, ‘I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped.’ And he said, ‘huh, could it be done any faster?’ And I was like, 'oh, shoot, I’ve said too long.' I said, ‘well, even if you did a death march crunch I don’t think you could do it faster than 12, and then you’d be shipping something that was unbalanced and buggy, and the team would be destroyed. So I don’t recommend that.’</p><p>“And he said, ‘ok, thanks.’ As we walked out he basically explained any answer over six months was going to result in him having to cancel it, meaning the answer I just gave got the game canceled. But he was going to cancel it anyway. He thought it couldn’t be done in six months, and I just confirmed that to him.”</p><p>According to Cain, the cancelation of Van Buren was, ultimately, about money; Interplay’s dire financial situation meant it simply did not have enough cash to fund more than six months of further development. But fans have always questioned Interplay and then majority owner Titus Interactive management, and the controversial decision to shift focus away from PC games to console games.</p><p>Interplay went on to close down Black Isle Studios and cut its entire staff. The company released console spin-off Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in 2004 for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but it was not enough. That same year, Interplay announced a licensing deal with The Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda for future Fallout games, and in 2007, Interplay sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda outright. The rest is history.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/root-the-board-game-buying-guide.906360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>On its surface, there is no denying the visual appeal of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-review">Root by Leder games</a> with its adorable woodland critters adorning the box and storybook-esque art style. However, under its innocent facade is, in fact, a deep and occasionally cutthroat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game game</a> with complex factions to choose from, with each one playing drastically different from the others. Root is a challenging game to learn, with each faction playing differently from one another and there being a lot to keep track of (especially in larger groups). But with its complexity comes depth and avenues for strategy. </p><p>If you just snag the base game of Root, you will know pretty quickly – within a few playthroughs – whether it is a game for you or not. This buyer's guide highlights and goes into detail about all the various ways you can expand and further enrich your Root experience with new factions, mechanics, and ways to play!</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3><div id="155278"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $60.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>Root was first released back in 2018 and impressed players with its aesthetic that masks its intricate asymmetric gameplay. This base set of Root includes four factions that players can choose from – the Marquise de Cat, the Eyrie Dynasty, the Woodland Alliance, and the lone traveling Vagabond – with varying player counts preferring specific pairings for the best experience. You will need this box in order to take advantage of any of the following additional content, so consider this your starting point.</p><h2>For Those Who Want to Play Alone or Team Up</h2><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion 1 &amp; 2</h3><div id="197425"><p><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents (Clockwork 1 - REQUIRES BASE GAME)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Law of Robotics Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Priority Markers</li><li>31 Cards (12 Difficulties, 16 Traits, 3 Vagabots)</li><li>4 Faction Boards</li></ul><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 10+</li></ul><div id="197426"><p><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion 2</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents (Clockwork 2 - REQUIRES BASE GAME AND ONE OR BOTH OF RIVERFOLK OR UNDERWORLD EXPANSIONS)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Law of Robotics Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Priority Markers</li><li>47 Cards (12 Difficulties, 20 Traits, 3 Vagabots, 1 Interaction, 11 Services)</li><li>4 Faction Boards</li></ul><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 10+</li></ul><p>If there are any “must have '' expansions for Root, I would argue that it would be the Clockwork Expansions – at least the first one. These special expansions allow you to play Root as either a solo experience or a cooperative one, with the addition of “AI ''-controlled factions. The original Clockwork expansion includes robot versions of the base game’s factions (the Mechanical Marquise 2.0, Electrical Eyrie, Automated Alliance, and the Vagabot),  while the second box includes factions from other expansions (the Logical Lizards, Riverfolk Robots, Cogwheel Corvids, Drillbit Duchy, and additional Vagabot options).</p><h2>For Those Who Want More Faction Options</h2><h3>Root: The Riverfolk Expansion</h3><div id="197428"><p><h3>Root: The Riverfolk Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>3 New Vagabond Variants</li><li>1 “AI” Controlled Faction</li></ul><p>Lizard cultists and merchant otters have entered the woodlands of Root with the Riverfolk expansion. In addition to the new ways to play Root that both of these groups provide (nothing like some ritual sacrifice and capitalism), this expansion – along with the others that add new factions – increases the possible player count from four to six. The Riverfolk expansion also includes the original version of the Mechanical Marquise, allowing for solo play, but this “AI” faction was revamped and retooled to be better in the Clockwork Expansion.</p><h3>Root: The Underworld Expansion</h3><div id="197430"><p><h3>Root: The Underworld Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $50.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>1 Double-sided Map Board</li></ul><p>If you thought that things above ground in Root were hectic, just imagine how things are going underground! The Underworld expansion adds in two new factions to the Root mix – the moles of the Underground Duchy and the secretive crows of the Corvid Conspiracy. The Duchy can amass forces like the Marquise while mixing some of the political balancing shtick of the Eyrie, while the crows tend to work from the shadows – much like the Woodland Alliance agents - but with a bit more of a violent twist. Even if you and your players don’t feel like using the new factions, this expansion includes two new maps for you to wage your critter wars in.</p><h3>Root: The Marauder Expansion</h3><div id="197433"><p><h3>Root: The Marauder Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $50.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>4 Hirelings</li><li>Advanced Setup cards</li></ul><p>Badger Knight Templars seeking relics and angry rat hordes are what you have to look forward to in the Marauder Expansion with the Keepers in Iron and the Lord of the Hundreds. Whether it is attempting to bring your latest relic back to your keep safely or managing the mood of the Lord of the Rats, both of these factions feel especially unique. Marauders adds two new systems that you can apply to your normal Root games, too – the Advanced Setup rules and Hirelings. For experienced Root players, the  “Advanced Setup” cards will make the game even more of a wild challenge to contend with new options and restrictions. Hirelings provide players with recruitable units – from a faction not present in the game – that have specific actions that can be used.

The Landmarks pack lets you stop at various places to take advantage of different benefits, such as bartering items or making special items. The Exiles and Partisans deck replaces the default deck that comes with Root and includes some new cards that focus more on persistent effects and more – this pack is a quick and easy way to change things up without having to learn a brand new faction or system. Lastly, for those Vagabond fans out there, the Vagabond pack adds three brand new choices to pick from, in addition to providing you with unique wooden tokens representing each possible option.   </p><h2>Free Packs</h2><h3>The Outsiders Expansion</h3><div id="202225"><p><h3>Root: The Outsiders Expansion</h3></p></div><p>If you're truly dedicated, you can expand your root collection with this free, fan-made expansion that you'll need to downlod, print, and assemble yourself. A guide to doing so is included among the files in the download. For those willing to make the effort a wealth of new material awaits. The main draw is that there are no fewer than six-brand new factions to play with, with a supporting role for a new Vagabond variant, two new maps to play on and a new shared card deck. And if you don't want to go to the effort of pasting up the whole lot, it's modular, so you can pick and choose what you fancy. While it's unlikely to have had the same level of playtesting as official content, the reaction from players has been extremely positive, particularly for the additional maps.</p><h2>For Those Who Can’t Get Enough Root</h2><h3>Root: The RPG</h3><div id="197443"><p><h3>Root: The Tabletop Role-Playing Game</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 (Core Rule Book)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>3-5 Players</li><li>2-4 hours</li></ul><p>If you find yourself in love with the world and factions of Root, you can keep your adventures going with Root: The RPG from Magpie Games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-games-consoles-facing-extinction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The games industry is in constant flux; what we think we know today as fact is gone often completely different the next day.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, we used to go to a brick and mortar shop to buy the latest releases; now we can snap them up online and download them to our device without leaving our homes. Developers used to have to partner with publishers for their games to reach market; now they can use digital platforms and release their wares into the world without a middle man. We used to have a dedicated device like a console or PC to play the latest AAA blockbusters, now we can also play these directly on our mobile phone.</p>
<p>Much has changed in the last decade so there’s no reason to believe that how we play games today will be the same ten years from now. At the recent IGN Live, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>head Christopher Dring spoke to some of the smartest minds in the business to see how they feel playing games will change in the future.</p>
<p>For a long time, consoles have been one of the dominant forms of playing games, but the sector has stagnated somewhat, failing to grow and attract new audiences.</p>
<p>Tencent advisor and PlayStation alum Shawn Layden believes that consoles are indeed in trouble, but this isn't anything new.</p>
<p>"If you look at the history of consoles, the global install base in any one of those generations never rose above 250 million," he said. "There was that one point when Wii came out, and thanks to Wii Fit, an extra 20 million units were sold because everyone thought they could lose weight. But that wasn't sustainable and came crashing down and we're still in that 250 million overall install base of active consoles. That's a challenge.</p>
<p>"During the pandemic, revenue rose by 20 or 25%, but we were still getting more money from the same people. It wasn't necessarily bringing new people into the console gaming world. That's the existential threat to gaming right now."</p>
<p>Van Burnham, the author of Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, said that, having spoken to a variety of developers, she believes that an immersive-like Holodeck experience is the Holy Grail for game creators. That kind of technology is a long way off, but she thinks that consoles are going to play a vital role in bringing about that type of an experience at the point where we are capable of creating such things.</p>
<p>"Consoles are going to have to evolve to meet that future,” she said. "Are they going to be able to do that or not? A lot of that has to do with content, with how we make this business more sustainable, with how we foster more creativity and more experimentation in the risk-averse world that we are in, it becomes a little more of a challenge. I'm interested to see how publishers and console manufacturers are going to rise to meet that challenge."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The global install base in any console generation never rose above 250 million. Wii Fit [helped sell] an extra 20 million, but that wasn't sustainable"</p>
<cite>Shawn Layden</cite></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Wedbush Securities analyst and MD Michael Pachter believes that consoles aren't going anywhere. He does, however, predict that each successive generation will be smaller than the last. He added that developers will be able to choose their audience based on the hardware they opt to release games on.</p>
<p>"The best experience will be on a console. There will be a small subset – a couple of hundred million – who play it that way, and there'll be a large subset – three billion – who consume games a different way," he said. "What I think is really interesting is the convergence of the technology, where small screens get really powerful."</p>
<p>He continued: "Microsoft recently announced three new consoles. Two were digital-only with 1TB hard drives. Clearly that's the Game Pass device. What are they trying to do? They're trying to get a PlayStation owner to buy their first Xbox and sign up to Game Pass. It's smart. Business models will evolve but you'll always have a chance to play a game on a console.”</p>
<p>Though platforms like mobile have evolved to the point that consumers can play AAA games such as Assassin's Creed Mirage and Death Stranding on them, the inherent limitations of the hardware mean that consoles are often a more enticing proposition.</p>
<p>"Nothing is going to replace the experience of having an 85 inch 8K OLED and having an experience that's crafted to that, which is a really deep narrative where you can get into your Resident Evil 4 and your Last of Us, these type of really story-driven narrative experiences that make the most of that type of gameplay experience," Burnham said.</p>
<p>"That's what really needs to be focused on in order to differentiate it from PC gaming, which is a totally different experience."</p>
<p>One issue facing the console space is simple economics – AAA games cost much more to make, and thus, success is more precarious and harder to come by.</p>
<p>"Van puts forward a future I agree with, except for the fact that those games are going to cost $400 million to make and they're going to take seven years to get done," Layden said in response to Burnham's comments.</p>
<p>"That is the kind of cash burn and excessive time needed to get the product, which is really going to be an albatross on the console experience if we can't get a greater variety of content out there and because games are [expensive] to make, you don't get a lot of risk-taking."</p>
<p>As a result, the games industry has become more risk-averse. Rather than creating a wide variety of content that serves many different audiences, companies are more likely to stick to known IP and genres.</p>
<p>"We have to lower that entry point to get really high-end content into the community and business at a lower cost point in order to bring more variety," Layden continued. "Nothing was more variable than the PS2 era – from Katamari Damacy to SingStar to Eye Toy. At those development costs, you can make a lot more bets.</p>
<p>"Now we are seeing, sadly, most of the big ones that are coming out fall into well-known genres and categories, with the exception of something like Hi-Fi Rush, which was fresh and new. Almost everything else we're seeing now is pretty much an extension of where we've already been. That's not how you get new people into console gaming. The people who aren't console players now have already told us we're not interested in Fortnite, God of War, you name it. So by continuing to make more of the stuff we've made before, you won't get those people in now. They've already decided they don't want to play Call of Duty. Our lack of variety and the offering of content are some of our biggest risks going forward."</p>

<figcaption>Van Burnham believes attempting to replicate the accidental or organic success of Fortnite or Roblix is "not a viable business model"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While consoles have long been one of the main ways that people play video games, there are always new technologies on the horizon that put forward new ways for people to enjoy their favourite titles. For a long time, streaming threatened to open up games to a wider audience by removing the need for powerful hardware in their home, though to date this promise has largely failed to materialise.</p>
<p>As Layden points out, one major limitation streaming has faced is good, high-speed internet. "If you live in Tokyo, Seoul or Stockholm, you can have a streaming game live right now,” he explained. "If you live in Stockton, Muncie, Indiana or London, England, you can't have a streaming experience."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Nothing is going to replace the experience of having an 85 inch 8K OLED and having an experience that's crafted to that"</p>
<cite>Van Burnham</cite></blockquote>
<p>Burnham had similar thoughts on the matter, pointing to the litany of failures in this new sector, such as OnLive and Stadia.</p>
<p>"The technology is just too far away to make that a really viable platform," she said. "That said, I am very excited to see what Netflix could possibly do with the right direction."</p>
<p>Layden, however, didn't feel that streaming was out of the running. At the moment, most cloud platforms operate purely as delivery and distribution services; but they can also be used to provide powerful hardware remotely to the user.</p>
<p>"[There is also] cloud gaming where you are able to leverage the power of server-side CPU and GPU compute, which will give you more power than your console ever could at a price point you could afford," he said. "Then it becomes kind of interesting. If we make the server side do more of the heavy lifting and provide something that current console technology or even next-gen can't do from cost and maintenance and all that, then maybe you get some more interesting ideas around that."</p>
<p>Wedbush's Pachter said that streaming is going to "absolutely dominate" but does not think that it will ultimately replace consoles.</p>
<p>"We will continue to buy consoles or some very powerful device to play multiplayer because latency matters," he said. "You can absolutely stream single-player RPGs. Who cares how fast your internet connection is; if it buffers, you won't die. I don't think that you'll see Call of Duty multiplayer on streaming ever, but will you see Call of Duty single-player campaign? Trust me, there's a reason Microsoft fought so hard to buy Activision. They want that on Game Pass."</p>
<p>In recent years, we’ve also seen the rise of so-called ‘metaverse’ platforms – virtual worlds where people can gather to do a variety of things, including playing games. So far, Roblox and Fortnite are two of the biggest names in this burgeoning sector, at least on the video games side of things, both allowing players to take part in a variety of experiences. The former allows regular people to make and release games to the platform’s audience, while the latter features a variety of different experiences, including games and even concerts.</p>
<p>Layden feels that while this is an interesting new addition to the industry, it also is not a threat to single-player narrative titles that are beloved by console fans.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't think that you'll see Call of Duty multiplayer on streaming ever, but will we see Call of Duty's single-player campaign?"</p>
<cite>Michael Pachter, Wedbush Morgan</cite></blockquote>
<p>Burnham, meanwhile, says that these platforms are an entirely separate category to the rest of the games industry. She believes the success they have seen is not predictable or planned, but rather has been accidental or organic. For example, Fortnite was initially a full price survival game before its swift pivot to battle royale and, later, complete cultural domination.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem is that so many publishers look at the success of those platforms and think they need to do that,” Burnham said. "It's an accident. Will there be more content that will be able to achieve that level of success and find that audience? Maybe. But that's not something you can design. It's something that has to resonate with an audience. It's like lightning in a bottle. Replicating that is not a viable business model.</p>
<p>"A lot of publishers have gotten into trouble trying to chase that when it's not something you can just attain by throwing money at it. It's something that has to happen organically. Will there be other games like that? Absolutely. But I don't think that's something that can exist just as a category. You can't engineer success like that."</p>
<p>While Roblox features a massive number of games, these are all titles built on the platform itself. The company is yet to sell third-party titles, something Pachter says is down to its rather aggressive business model. The firm keeps 70% of revenue from sales – compared to most other game platforms, which retain around 30% – which the analyst said is something Roblox needs to adjust before it can be a meaningful contender to other game platforms.</p>
<p>"They’ll be just like iOS, Android, Xbox or PlayStation," Pachter said. "It won’t be for AAA experiences, but [absolutely perfect for games like] Helldivers or Palworld. I think they're onto something and will figure it out."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/God-of-war-ragnarok_Kk8zhZv.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Layde says that as long as platform holders focus on extensions of what's come before, growth for consoles will be limited</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding things off, we asked our panel what the future of playing games looks like. Layden pointed out that Microsoft and Sony used to make machines with very different architectures, but now, they are more or less the same AMD hardware. They are so similar now, that we are talking about small differences in technical issues that most people will not notice.</p>
<p>"We're talking about ray tracing differentials and most of us [don’t have good enough TVs] so can't see the ray tracing anyway," Layden said. "Xbox, PlayStation, high-end PC, that's almost at a plateau where all things being equal, they're pretty much the same. We'd be in a better world if we could get down to one standard home console technology that we could come together, and get this platform war thing out of the way."</p>
<p>Burnham, meanwhile, is more interested in newer kinds of games. "I want to imagine a future where there are more really exciting location-based gaming environments; just like how people still go to the theatre to see a film, people will create some amazing metaverse volumes where you can go and interact in a specific type of world," she said. "But we're going to generally be playing games at home in the environment we have created."</p>
<p>Finally, Pachter believes we are going to be scalable experiences that can be played across a variety of devices.</p>
<p>"It's exactly like the consumption of video entertainment; 100 years ago, no one could have conceived that we'd consume film entertainment outside of a movie theatre and now you can consume it right now on your phone," he said. "I just think that games are going to keep going that way. The experience will be dumbed down for your phone and sped up for your 80-inch LG OLED TV.</p>
<p>"I think we'll play games everywhere."</p>

            <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">devastating closures at Bethesda</a>, Microsoft has started refunding those who purchased Redfall's premium Bite Back edition.</p>
<p>This edition of Arkane Austin's vampire shooter was set to provide players with the Redfall Hero Pass, which would have added a further two characters to the game. In November, the studio said it was "continuing development of The Hero Pass and we're excited to share more about Redfall's new heroes and other updates later next year".</p>
<p>However, following the studio's closure last month, Arkane Austin confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">Hero Pass DLC for Redfall would no longer be released</a>. At this time, the studio said those who had purchased the DLC via either the Bite Back edition or base game upgrade would instead receive credit to the same value as the pass.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, a little over a month since these refunds were first announced, Microsoft has begun reimbursing players. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redfall/comments/1djpts6/check_your_emails/">Several people</a> have reported Microsoft has been automatically refunding buyers the full amount of the DLC. This is even if a refund had not been requested.</p>
<p>Others who bought the physical edition of the Bite Back Upgrade said they are still waiting to receive their credit. If you are one such customer, you can contact <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/zenimax-media/bethesda-softworks/">Bethesda</a> <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/1241">customer support</a> for information on how to request a refund.</p> <div>

<p>At the end of May, Arkane Austin released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfalls-final-patch-is-here-marking-the-end-of-an-era-for-arkane-austin">Redfall's final ever update</a>, known as version 1.451.3.0 - a nod to video games' ongoing 0-4-5-1 easter egg, which dates back almost 30 years. This update added an offline mode to Redfall, among other features.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soma">Soma</a>, launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/282140/view/5997186379240878314?l=english">the soft toy depiction</a> of the game's protagonist Simon on <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/simon-from-soma-plush">Makeship</a>, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The statue of limitations for spoilers on Soma is long gone (and the appearance of the plushie constitutes a spoiler in itself), so let's remind ourselves why Soma is such a disturbing, philosophical horror. </p>
<p>For much of the game you believe you're a human surrounded by robotic lifeforms. But your character, turns out, is a robot himself. You trundle through the sparking ruins of the leaky subaquatic base transferring your consciousness from one robo-body to another in a creepy copy-and-paste ceremony that lets you reach new areas. But in doing this, you leave a previous copy of yourself stuck. Ah. </p>
<p>Stranded, alone, and terrified, you have to listen to their (your?) horrified screams and pleas as you leave them (you?) behind. At the end of the game, you perform one final transference of consciousness to escape the dying facility. A paradise-like storage space for AI awaits, safety from all the grime and rust and fear you've gone through. Sanctuary, comfort, companionship. The transfer works!</p>
<p>But this time, you're the one left behind. </p>
<p>In this light, I could see why someone might want to cuddle Simon. Not for their own sake, but for his. Soma is a game about abandonment, identity, and what it means to have a body (also, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>). I definitely didn't play it and think: "Cute!" But at the time of writing over 500 people are willing to pay for an adorable totem of existential isolation, yet more proof that the ambivalent appeal of the cute-horror fusion is real. I can respect that.</p>
<p>Like I say, Frictional Games aren't the first to farm fuzz from phobia. Edwin points out there is a <a href="https://afterthecredits.net/en/collectibles/plushes/800/silent-hill-plush-pyramid-head">plushie of Pyramid Head</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, for example. You can also get the <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/cursed-monkey-paw-plushie">cursed monkey paw</a> from torch-lit terrorizer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, the <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/goblin-plush-1">goblin guys</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, and of course the <a href="https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Plushies_(Merchandise)">many freaky friends</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> - a horror series ripe for plushification. What makes me marvel at Soma's plushie is that, while these others represent something unabashedly harmful - monsters, curses, enemies out to get you - poor little Simon is a soft symbol of a <em>conceptual</em> horror. You can't defeat or outrun or even hug away the horror of Soma. It makes this little robot fleeceboi all the more unsettling. It is a toy that makes me laugh, nervously.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-pass-pc-once-again-lacks-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-at-still-wakes-the-deeps-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Microsoft has made strides with Game Pass PC and Microsoft Store versions of PC games, there's still a lot to do in this area, as testified by the recent release of Still Wakes the Deep.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's first-person survival horror adventure game is only the latest game to launch on Game Pass PC with several missing features, including NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR, both of which are available on Steam and Epic Games Store. The same happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-lacks-ray-tracing-and-nvidia-dlss-if-you-get-it-from-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neon Giant's The Ascent</a> in 2021 (that game also lacked ray tracing) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-dlss-has-been-fixed-for-pc-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gunfire's Remnant II</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Chinese Room <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/6234751708920749809/?ctp=4#c6234751708921440114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a detailed explanation on the Steam community forums.</p>
<p><em>To add more information, we have some technical limitations due to the difference between how the Game Pass and Steam / Epic Store versions are built. Unfortunately, this means that other upscaling options aren't available in the Game Pass version.</em></p>
<p><em>The PS5, Xbox X|S, and WinGDK (Game Pass PC) versions all have the same options. While we added extra upscaling options to the Steam and Epic Store versions. Adding them to WinGDK would require a custom coded solution.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your feedback. We are a small team and we want to help as many people play on a wide range of hardware so we will let everyone know if it's possible for us to create an update to add this feature in the future.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, the studio has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/4345491756988100844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new update, revealing that NVIDIA DLSS will be added to the Game Pass PC version of Still Wakes the Deep in an update scheduled to launch in July alongside other fixes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>crash/performance bugs</li>
<li>settings reverting to default status</li>
<li>deactivated subtitles reappearing</li>
<li>on-screen button prompt visibility</li>
<li>the Mud Handling progression bug</li>
<li>Yellow Marker toggle, which enables players to deactivate navigation aids in the form of yellow paint spills</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chinese Room is also investigating the possibility of adding AMD FSR. The developers promised to get back to the community once a decision has been reached.</p>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While Game Freak no doubt has its hands full working on <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-pokemon-legends-game-is-on-the-way-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends ZA</a></em>, it’s had the time to work on another project independent of its iconic monster-catching franchise. Although this one is distinctly smaller-scale, being a free-to-play mobile game titled <em>Pand Land</em>.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Game Freak is not the sole developer on this title, having partnered with another Japanese studio called WonderPlanet, which has primarily worked on other free-to-play mobile games. In <a href="https://wonderpla.net/news/20240619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> shared earlier today (translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/game-freak-and-wonderplanet-announce-free-to-play-sailing-adventure-rpg-pand-land-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), the two studios describe <em>Pand Land</em> as a “casual sailing adventure RPG… where you become the captain of an expedition team and set out on a journey in search of legendary treasure.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="『パンドランド』公式PV | カジュアル海洋冒険譚RPG" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poCTNS-bB5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">At first, it sounded to me like an attempt at aping Rare’s hit live-service <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, albeit with a blocky art style reminiscent of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-quest-is-adorable-but-ultimately-just-another-tapper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Quest</a></em> (how many of you even remember <em>Pokémon Quest</em>?). Upon watching the trailer, though, it’s more of a dungeon crawler, with you sailing to and exploring various islands with a top-down perspective. That said, there is a multiplayer component like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, where you can team up with other players and adventure together.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">The game promises over 400 party members you can recruit, some of which appear to be blocky, colourful animals, while others are human crew members. The trailer also boasts some nice character art you could easily mistake for being from a <em>Pokémon</em> game since they’re clearly done by the same artists for that series.</p> <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="925" data-injectable="true"><em>Pand Land</em> seems like a cute and harmless enough time, though it’s unclear how its monetisation will work, and how much of a grind it can be if you don’t want to fork over real money for its microtransactions. I would say you don’t have long to wait to try it out, since it’s launching on the App Store and the Google Play store on Monday, June 24, but <em>Pand Land</em> is so far only scheduled for a Japanese release. There’s no mention of it coming to the West, but WonderPlanet has made a couple of its previous mobile games available worldwide so there’s always a chance.</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="false">This is hardly the first Game Freak title to not be related to <em>Pokémon</em>. In the past, the studio’s put out games like RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-little-town-hero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Town Hero</a></em> and the free-to-play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-pocket-card-jockey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket Card Jockey</a></em>. It’s also meant to be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/game-freak-partners-with-private-division-new-game-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaming up with Private Division on a new action-adventure game</a>, but considering Take-Two is reportedly shutting down Private Division in its entirety (according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), who knows what’s happening with that project.</p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">UEFA’s Euro 2024 football tournament is in full swing, and while the players are all wearing the latest and greatest cleats during matches, Albania’s Jasir Asani caught the eye of gamers everywhere with his special <em>Super Mario</em>-themed boots. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Asani, who players his club football in South Korea with Gwangju FC, sported a pair of teal Puma boots, with Mario himself featured on his left foot, his red hat and mustache instantly recognizable. On it, he’s jumping into the air with his fist up, with coins flying around him. </p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">It should come as no surprise that his right foot showcased Luigi, also jumping for joy, while the inside of both boots featured more gold coins to show how successful the brothers have been. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C424yiIt8QB/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">The boots were designed by Swithadot, and clearly worked their magic, with Asani conjuring up the assist for Albania’s first goal in their 2-2 draw with Croatia on June 19. Clearly, Asani is a big fan of the franchise and showed off his love on one of football’s biggest stages. </p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">And what better time to do it too, with a brand-new game in the franchise announced during June 18’s Nintendo Direct. Mario and Luigi reunite for the first time in nine years in <em>Brothership</em>, with the trailer showing off the new world, mini-games in battles, and the classic platforming experience that we expect from Nintendo’s flagship. </p> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>releases worldwide on Nintendo Switch on November 7. Let’s hope that Asani finds time to play it as the K League 1 reaches its conclusion. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/captain-blood-a-hack-and-slash-pirate-game-revealed-in-2004-will-finally-release-in-2024.906333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/captain-blood-a-hack-and-slash-pirate-game-revealed-in-2004-will-finally-release-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBOEkEsOnG4">Early footage</a> painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.</p>
<p>Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hack-therefore-slash-captain-blood">cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008</a>. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The game underwent several iterations throughout the 2000s and was last showcased in 2010 before vanishing for years," reads a note on Captain Blood's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040220/Captain_Blood/">Steam page</a>. "Now, we are excited to bring it back, combining its original glory with a series of modern improvements for today's gamers." The re-reveal trailer above strongly resembles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhleo2vCscQ">this one from 2010</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Blood - which, yes, the blundering bosuns of RPS past are guilty of confusing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-captain-blood">the Atari ST adventure game of the same name</a>, sorry about that - still doesn't have a final release date, but they're aiming for "fall 2024". There's definitely a longer story to write about why, exactly, the game has been in Davey Jones's locker all these years, but for the moment, all I can tell you is that Seawolf Studio are a new outfit, based in Newcastle, UK, while General Arcade are a porting studio who operate out of Singapore and Malaysia. Publishers SNEG were founded in 2020 by former GOG staffers Oleg Klapovskiy and Elena Roor, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sneg-games/about/">describe themselves</a> as "focused on reviving classic games from the digital abyss and legal hell". Their previous Steam releases include Blade Of Darkness, originally released in 2001, and Star General, originally released in 1996.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft is now seemingly offering Redfall refunds for the Xbox and Steam version of the game's 'Bite Back' edition.</p>
<p>Last month, to the surprise (and anger) of many, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft announced the closure</a> of various first-party studios, including Tango Gameworks, several Bethesda Softworks studios, and Arkane Austin - the developer behind last year's Redfall.</p>
<p>Redfall launched with various editions, including the 'Bite Back' edition (both digital and physical), which included access to two upcoming heroes. As most of you will know, Redfall didn't have the best launch, and following the recent closure of Arkane Austin, the promised new heroes never saw the light. Microsoft has since promised that 'make-good offers' for those who bought the 'Bite Back' edition, but we didn't know what this offer would include - until now. At least, WindowsCentral now reports that Microsoft is seemingly offering refunds to digital owners. Not only that, but some players are claiming that Bethesda has been offering refunds for the physical version as well (through a ticket). "Refunds seem to be rolling out in waves, with some having received one already, while others are currently in waiting", the article from WindowsCentral <a href="http://Refunds%20seem%20to%20be%20rolling%20out%20in%20waves,%20with%20some%20having%20received%20one%20already,%20while%20others%20are%20currently%20in%20waiting.%20You%20should%20check%20your%20Junk%20Mail%20attached%20to%20your%20Steam%20or%20Xbox%20account%20in%20case%20it%20has%20fallen%20in%20there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reads</a>. "You should check your Junk Mail attached to your Steam or Xbox account in case it has fallen in there."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Arkane Austin's closure, Arkane Austin's Studio Director, Harvey Smith, took to X with an emotional goodbye, in <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-austin-studio-director-gives-emotional-goodbye-to-colleagues-wonders-about-the-sweet-spot-team-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which he also questioned what would be the ideal team size when it comes to making the games he likes</a>.</p>
<p>Redfall is avaialble now across Xbox Series X|S and PC. Here's what we wrote about the vampire shooter in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our launch review</a> last year:</p>
<p><em>"With Redfall, Arkane strayed a bit too far from its roots and couldn't nail the landing. While the core gameplay is fun, and there are moments of brilliance that harken back to Arkane's glorious portfolio, most of the studio's strengths clearly do not mesh well with the open world genre, as exemplified by the disappointing safe house missions. Additionally, the writing is very uneven, never succeeding in making the player care about any of the characters, and the co-op mode adds little substance."</em></p>

There will be tremendous benefits for our creative teams regarding scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more. And, as models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time.

            <p>Bluepoint Games is still "working on an original title" for its parent company Sony.</p>
<p>The Demon's Souls remake developer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">acquired by Sony back in 2021</a>. At this time, it said it was "working on original content right now", and while the studio could not share any further specifics, it called this "the next step in the evolution for us".</p>
<p>In the years since, the developer has remained quiet on its plans. However, when asked if the studio was still working on original content during an exchange on social media platform X, Bluepoint's head of technology Peter Dalton replied: "Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title."</p>

<p>"Everything takes time," Dalton continued, adding the Bluepoint team is "committed to sharpening our skills!"</p>
<p>Bluepoint Games is known for its remakes and remasters. Along with Demon's Souls - which released back in 2020 as a PlayStation 5 launch title - the studio was also behind titles such as Uncharted's Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush Remastered, and a Shadow of the Colossus remake.</p> <div>

<p>Confirmation from Dalton that Bluepoint is still working on its original title stemmed from an earlier post on the developer's feed. Here, Dalton shared his thoughts about FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki's comments regarding layoffs.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Miyazaki, who is currently preparing for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-layoffs-at-fromsoftware-wont-happen-as-long-as-this-company-is-my-responsibility-says-miyazaki">mass layoffs won't happen at his studio "as long as this company is my responsibility"</a>. Dalton called this stance "very respectable".</p>

This acts as an update to the Elden Ring base game and a day one patch for the hotly anticipated expansion.</p><p>Patch 1.12 adds new inventory features, including marking newly obtained items with a "!“, and a new tab called Recent Items so players can quickly review recently obtained items.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/er1-1718871509420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Elsewhere, there are new Summoning Pool features, such as active Summoning Pools now carrying over to NG+, and individual Summoning Pools enabled / disabled in the newly added Map Functions Menu.

Just like previous FromSoftware games Dark Souls and Bloodborne, however, accessing the DLC isn't as simple as selecting it on a menu, as players must tick off a handful of obscure feats beforehand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc"><u>including beating an optional boss</u></a>. Thankfully, IGN has a guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC"><u>how to prepare for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</u></a> if you need to scramble ahead of the expansion's release.

We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><h2>Elden Ring update 1.12 patch notes:</h2><h2><strong>New feature</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added support for the <strong>SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE DLC</strong>.</li><li>Five new hairstyles have been added to the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-developer-alleges-things-were-going-extremely-well-before-its-cancellation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=life-by-you-developer-alleges-things-were-going-extremely-well-before-its-cancellation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="453" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was already disappointing to hear that Sims competitor <em>Life by You</em> had been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-calls-off-its-early-access-launch-with-no-new-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indefinitely delayed</a>, but it seemed the behind-the-scenes situation was grimmer than we thought. Earlier this week, Paradox Interactive announced it had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-canceled-after-being-indefinitely-delayed-a-month-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only cancelled the game</a>, but had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-shutting-down-life-by-you-developer-paradox-tectonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down developer Paradox Tectonic too</a>. In the wake of this, though, one member of the now defunct studio has claimed that progress on the game was going much better than it sounded.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/former-dev-from-sunken-sims-competitor-life-by-you-alleges-the-team-had-the-rug-pulled-from-under-them-despite-outperforming-the-company-s-internal-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, one Willem Delventhal took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifyouwillem_indierevolution-gamedev-gamedevelopment-activity-7208887303224606720-cgcV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> to say that the team at Paradox Tectonic were doing “extremely well” ahead of <em>Life by You</em>‘s planned early access launch on June 4. After having already been delayed once before, the game was suddenly put on an indefinite hiatus, followed by the aforementioned cancellation.</p> <figure data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Paradox Interactive</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">“I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion,” wrote Delventhal. He added that they “got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch,” which makes it sound like the delay was as much of a surprise to the team as it was to fans waiting to play <em>Life by You</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="808" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">By comparison, Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester, when explaining the reasons for the cancellation, had said <em>Life by You</em> would not be able to meet the company’s expectations and that “a version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away.” This doesn’t match up with what Delventhal is alleging. By his account, everything was going incredibly smoothly, especially if they were exceeding internal targets, yet Paradox pulled the plug anyway. Deventhal has also claimed he and his team were never told why their studio was closing: “Instead we spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back.”</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">It must be stressed that Delventhal’s comments do not represent the rest of Paradox Tectonic; he is only speaking for himself, and has refrained from sharing his own theories on why the project was ultimately canned. However, he did add, “This industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch.”</p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">The games industry is most certainly in a rocky state; in fact, calling it rocky is a massive understatement. After all, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a distressing number of people have been laid off this year</a>, and that number has only increased thanks to the closure of Paradox Tectonic.</p>

		<p>Maze Theory, developers of Peaky Blinders: The Kings of Random and Doctor Who: The Edge of Time, has announced a mixed reality puzzle adventure game, Infinite Inside. The game is coming out on 12th July just in time for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> launch in Europe, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a> and Pico, where it will be able to feature mixed reality. A fully VR version is also releasing on the same date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and Steam VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Infinite Inside will look to blend together augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) on platforms that support it, starting off in your living room (other real world play spaces are available, and VR-only platforms will have a fully virtual space) with a strange pillar sprouting out of the floor and then zipping you in and out of full VR spaces. The puzzling looks to revolve around finding complex broken up blocks and piecing them together like 3D jigsaw pieces. These then slot into that stone pillar in your room.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting concept, putting puzzling first with a light narrative wrapped around it, as you follow echoes of past explorers, and one that Maze Thoery has opened up to VR enthusiasts via ApplLab and SideQuest already, gaining community feedback to help improve the game.</p>


<p>Ian Hambleton, Maze Theory CEO, says: “With&nbsp;Infinite Inside&nbsp;we’re looking to break new ground, by interweaving MR and VR in previously unseen ways. Demo feedback shows we’ve hit the spot, as mixed reality fans and gamers love it”</p>
<p>Another key element is how it uses the MR capabilities of each specific headset, with Quest 3 users having controllers to use and support for hand tracking, while Apple’s fledgeling platform</p>
<p>He adds: “It’s the advanced, innovative new experience that early adopters of MR technology (Quest 3, Apple VisionPro) have been waiting for. The game has a broad appeal for curious creatives and problem solvers, tech enthusiasts as well as fans of adventure and puzzle gaming. It’s pure escapism and offers top quality graphic environments and intuitive authentic interaction.”</p>

        <p>Sony has yet to exhibit at world's biggest games trade show since the event returned after the lockdown years</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment will reportedly not attend this year's Gamescom in Cologne.</p>
<p>The platform holder told German trade outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-2024-sony-playstation-absage/">Games Wirtschaft</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-is-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year/">VGC</a>, that it will not be exhibiting at the annual games trade show.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Sony for confirmation.</p>
<p>2024 would mark the third year running that PlayStation has skipped Gamescom, having opted not to exhibit in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-will-not-attend-gamescom-2022">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-skips-out-on-gamescom">2023</a>. The company has not appeared at the show since 2019; Gamescom was either cancelled or a digital-only affair the following two years due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The platform holder also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-will-skip-e3-2019">dropped support for E3 in 2019</a>, although that show never returned as a physical event after that year.</p>
<p>Sony has already announced its 2024 line-up via a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">digital State of Play presentation</a>, which aired at the end of May.</p>
<p>Its key releases for the second half of the year included new live service multiplayer shooter Concord, PC editions of Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok, and the first full-length Astro Bot title.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also previously stated it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-skipping-gamescom">will not be attending Gamescom 2024</a>, although it will be <a href="https://www.gamesmarkt.de/business/big-in-latam-gamescom-latam-announces-exhibitor-line-up-with-nintendo-and-more-f8c1620815443525fc1cc12e409a2862">exhibiting at the inaugural Gamescom Latam</a> in São Paulo, Brazil next week.</p>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Great news, <em>Helldivers 2</em> fans! The special cape designed to commemorate the review bomb controversy after Sony required players to have a PSN account is complete, according to Arrowhead CCO John Pilestedt. Bad news: It’s not being released just yet. </p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">In response to a fan question about the cape, Pilestedt confirmed that work on the special cosmetic item had been completed, but had no timeframe for a drop date, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801636341362393548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a>: “We want to find the right time to release it.”</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">What that means in terms of an actual launch date is unknown, and really could mean days, weeks, or even months before we get our hands on it. </p> <figure data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em> players went to war over the PSN changes. Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cape was originally teased by Pilestedt</a> back on May 11, posting a cropped image of a cape. It is being created to commemorate one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s darkest weekends when fans revolted against <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s decision to make PSN accounts mandatory for PC players.</a> The decision was so unpopular that the game’s dedicated fanbase and players who truly love the game decided to take action and post thousands of negative reviews against the game on Steam, using it to show their anger with Sony. </p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">Eventually, with the negativity being so widespread and the negative reviews tanking <em>Helldivers 2</em> overall rating to “Overwhelmingly Negative” on Steam, Sony had to backpedal and admit defeat, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scrapping the plan entirely</a>. </p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="false">While this may not be a pleasant memory for Sony or Arrowhead, it was an incredible moment for gamers, showing that if we fight hard enough for what we believe in, we can convince developers and publishers to change course. For that reason, plenty of <em>Helldivers</em> will wear this cape with pride whenever we finally get our hands on it in-game. </p>

			<p>Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor might be nearing its launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The news comes from the Brazilian rating board, <a href="https://x.com/the_marmolade/status/1802922700983148876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Twitter/X user @the_marmolade.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-coming-to-ps4-and-xb1-ea-teases-more-games-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in August 2023 that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor would be released for eighth-generation consoles after all. Originally, the action/adventure game was billed as exclusive for the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>It had been nearly a year since we got any update, though. Some fans were legitimately wondering if it would ever happen. While that's certainly good news, as more gamers will be able to play the game, there's also the performance factor to consider.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was famously problematic in this regard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-pc-players-apology-respawn-no-comprehensive-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially on PC</a>. Respawn Entertainment has released several performance updates post-launch, though some issues remain to this day.</p>
<p>That said, the game itself is pretty good. It earned 8.3 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi: Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>
<p>A third and possibly final game in the saga <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-jedi-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the works</a>, as revealed by actor Cameron Monaghan, who voices and lends his likeness to protagonist Cal Kestis. It'll likely be at least two to three years before it can be released, though.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have released the official Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree launch trailer ahead of tomorrow's global release.</p>
<p>Elden Ring's first official expansion is out tomorrow, and to celebrate the DLC's launch, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco released a 3-minute-long trailer for it. The trailer shows the game's environments, enemies, combat, weaponry, and much more. We've included it below. Be sure to check it out to fuel the hype for the expansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-Xh4vbs6go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"Witness the birth of a God. The coming of a Lord. And follies better left forgotten. In that forsaken place, blood must spill."</em></p>
<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree launches worldwide tomorrow for PC and consoles. Ahead of tomorrow's release we already published <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a>, which you can read in full here. Down below we've included a short part of it:</p>
<p><em>After that, it did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-is-getting-team-deathmatch-tomorrow.906282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-team-deathmatch-coming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>XDefiant was released on May 21 to a relatively positive reception, but the free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft wasn’t without its teething problems. To give credit to the team at Ubisoft, updates have already been released to patch out some of the most considerable issues in the game, and recently, the first season of the title was revealed, showcasing new maps, weapons, and a new faction.</p>



<p>Now, Ubisoft has announced the impending arrival of Team Deathmatch, due to land in XDefiant tomorrow, June 21.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slaying">Slaying</h2>



<p>XDefiant has a few modes that FPS fans are very familiar with. For instance, there’s Domination, which is a tried-and-tested trope popularised by the likes of Call of Duty. Then there’s Escort, which bears strong similarities to the game mode of the same name in Overwatch 2. There isn’t anything <strong>too </strong>tactical, though – most game modes involve rampant run-and-gun styles of play.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is set to expand on that sentiment tomorrow by introducing Team Deathmatch, a timeless mode that pits two teams against one another and challenges them to get a certain number of kills faster than their opponents.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that the development path for 2023’s vampire-slaying game, Redfall, was coming to an abrupt end as Microsoft moved to shut down Arkane Austin, amongst other studios. Redfall was released in May 2023 to a crushingly negative reception, given that the game was plagued with bugs, barren, and bursting with bizarre AI-driven enemies.</p>



<p>It was just a couple of weeks back that Redfall’s final update was released by Arkane Austin before the ultimate closure of the studio. Now, thanks to the fact that promised content can’t be delivered, Microsoft is issuing automatic refunds on Steam and Xbox to those who purchased the ‘Bite Back’ edition or upgrade of Redfall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-bark-no-bite">All Bark, No Bite</h2>



<p>Following the final major update to Redfall, it has been confirmed by several players that Microsoft is automatically refunding them to make up for the content that they’ll never get. It was confirmed by reports <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-has-begun-sending-out-refunds-for-the-xbox-and-steam-digital-versions-of-redfalls-bite-back-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handed to Windows Central</a> that Bethesda Game Studios is also issuing refunds, but the path to obtaining them is a little tougher.</p>



<p>Redfall won’t be missed by too many people, but it’s a shame that it ended how it did. I was sceptical about Redfall and abandoned it at launch because of the issues but ultimately returned to the game several months later – and I had a great time with it. It was a run-of-the-mill open-world action title with some basic RPG elements and a little co-op mixed in for good measure. It wasn’t that bad and I had a great time playing it.</p>



<p>Before shutting down, Arkane Austin introduced an offline-based single-player mode to the game, eradicating the need to always be online and allowing users to play Redfall even when the studio has been fully shut down and taken offline. </p>

"Though the remake has a couple of blemishes, it's still an easy game to recommend. People speak of Link's Awakening as the secret best Zelda game," critic Peter Brown wrote. "That's a tough call to make, but it's definitely <em>one </em>of the best. If you haven't touched a classic Zelda game in a while, Link's Awakening will almost instantly transport you back to the '90s. It's simple, in many ways, but the orchestrated journey still conveys a sense of adventure, and this new version is without question the best way to experience it. And more than anything else, it will put a smile on your face. Remakes are a dime a dozen nowadays and often easy to overlook. Don't make that mistake with Link's Awakening."</p><p>Link's Awakening isn't the only Zelda game on sale right now, though.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/paradox-life-by-you-tectonic-laid-off-cancelled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life By You</em>, a formerly-upcoming <em>Sims </em>rival, was supposed to be out in Early Access on June 4. It didn't make it. Two weeks after that missed deadline it was cancelled entirely, before the public even got a chance to test it, and now a day later <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news is out that the entire studio behind it has been shut down</a>.</p><p>I know I mentioned some of this briefly in an update to my original "<a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox, What Are You Doing?</a>" post, but that was a story mostly about the company's doomed attempts at publishing external games. Given this is a result of Paradox's <em>internal </em>struggles I wanted to break this news out into its own blog.</p><p>Paradox Tectonic was opened by its Swedish parent company back in March 2019, expressly to develop this game. This is the part of the article where I stress that the broader outcomes here are nothing new, that studio closures linked to game cancellations have long been part of this industry, as has been laying off workers when their work on a game is finished. I'm not saying that's <em>right</em>, just that there's precedent for it.</p><p>But those moves have traditionally come when a game is out and has, by whatever metric, failed. Or, at the other end of the scale, when a game fails to get off the ground earlier in development, and a publisher decides to cut its losses, or as it would probably say, "reallocate resources". To commit five years of work, to build an entire company around the goal of producing a single game, and then throw it all in the bin just <em>days </em>before it was supposed to come out is a whole new level of ineptitude that's particularly cruel, even by this industry's cruel-by-default standards. </p><p>My <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Paradox post</a> targeted their publishing arm because, over the last couple of years, it's been the most public example of the company stepping on rake after rake after rake. But to silo those publishing woes is to excuse some of  Paradox's other internal missteps which, and stop me if you've heard this before, can mostly be traced back to their decision to go public in 2016, a move that saw the company rapidly transition from the makers of some excellent (albeit niche) strategy games into...whatever it is now. </p><p>Paradox Tectonic is the perfect case study for this. Formed in 2019, it had one job: take on <em>The Sims</em>, a game that has for decades remained largely unchallenged in the genre it created. So they hired Rod Humble--former head of The Sims at EA!--and got to work. For <em>years</em> the team chipped away at EA's colossus, through a global pandemic, then <em>after </em>a global pandemic, to the point where on June 4--that's June 4, 2024, just <em>days ago</em>--it was meant to come out in Early Access and be played by fans around the world. </p><p>The reasons given for first its delay and then its ultimate cancellation are basically that Paradox, just <em>days </em>before the game's public release, didn't just realise that the game wasn't great, but that it was so busted that it could <em>never </em>be great:</p><blockquote><p>...<strong>when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process</strong>.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That's <em>wild</em>. What the fuck was happening there? Who had been overseeing development for those five years, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180452/life-by-you-canceled-paradox-interactive#:~:text=Life%20By%20You%20was%20last,March%205%2C%20then%20June%204." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to see its Early Access delayed twice already</a>, then have it get to the point it was finally days away that release, only for someone <em>else </em>to swoop in and say it was so bad it needed to be cancelled? That's a level of ineptitude that I can't remember ever seeing at this end of the business before. Releasing a bad game then trying to fix it with updates is one thing, as is cancelling a bad game much earlier in development. But this? This speaks to something being very wrong at the highest levels of Paradox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-by-you-team-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-before-studio-closure-laid-off-paradox-dev-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially when the affected workers reportedly only found out through a public announcement</a>.</p><p>Something the company even admitted in <em>Life By You's </em>cancellation! Saying the late decision was "a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community's expectations", deputy CEO Mattias Lilja put on record:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better</strong>.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>They absolutely do, if only so something of this magnitude never happens again. Which, of course, will come too late for the workers at Paradox Tectonic, who once again find themselves on the wrong end of a power imbalance that has hit the video game industry especially hard over the last 12 months: <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was Paradox's executives who dropped the ball here</a>, but it's the workers at Tectonic--days away from having their game released--who have paid the price. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
