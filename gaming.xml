This 2024 colorful 2.5D  platformer is easily of one of the best “metroidvania” games released in years, and it’s definitely one of Ubisoft’s best games in recent memory. It plays wonderfully, looks amazing, runs like a dream, and has some memorable boss fights.  It’s also not massive. Most people can finish it in under 18 hours. Seriously, check this one out later this month on either PS4 or PS5. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you want to see where the<em> Armored Core</em> franchise started, the first three PS1-era games will be added to PS Plus Premium later this month.

Perhaps I’ll give them a shot later this March. </p><p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber.

                <p>The MMO Defiance, which was shut down in 2021, is coming back to life. For anyone unaware, Defiance was a third-person shooter MMO from Trion Worlds that was developed as a tie-in for the Syfy show of the same name, with events and storylines running across the game and the TV show. It launched in 2013 as a paid game for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, before adopting a free-to-play model and continued to receive updates even after the TV show was canceled in 2015. A new version of the game, Defiance 2050, came out in 2018--but both games shut down servers in 2021. Now, Defiance is attempting a comeback.</p><p>Fawkes, a game company whose mission is "breathing life to old worlds and preserving their legacy," has announced plans to bring Defiance back following a deal with previous rights-owner Gamigo.</p><p>"Even though the TV series was discontinued in 2015 and Gamigo eventually closed the game in 2021, the memories of epic Arkfalls and immersive, post‑apocalyptic battles live on in your hearts," Fawkes said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Jfk8Pt8B4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p1Jfk8Pt8B4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fawkes said it has acquired the license to the "worldwide development and publishing rights" for Defiance and Defiance 2050 on all platforms. The first step in the comeback is relaunching the original game on PC in April 2025.</p><p>"Our relaunch is designed to be a homecoming for those who once fought side by side during legendary Arkfalls. We want you to return to a familiar world that still holds countless memories, and to create new ones with friends both old and new," Fawkes said.</p><p>Should the re-launch go well in April 2025 on PC, Fawkes said it will "explore the possibility" of bringing Defiance back to consoles.</p><p>"We will start small, with a very clean state of the game, with the design and drop we understood you like, and grow from there together with you, bringing the changes that had an impact and leaving behind the ones that didn’t. We are ready to re-build Defiance together with you, Arkhunters," Fawkes said.</p><p>Fans can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fawkes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fawkes Discord</a> channel to stay up to date on the newest developments.</p><p>"Thank you for keeping the flame of Defiance alive all these years. We can't wait to welcome you back into the world of epic battles and unforgettable moments. Get ready to Defy the odds once again!" Fawkes said.</p><p>Fawkes also helped revive the games Shaiya and Last Chaos, and also has the rights to Desert Operations and Wargame 1942.</p>

They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it.”</p><p>The internal communication said that while progress had been made on some issues, the guild was not close to a deal on AI protections. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It linked to an extensive breakdown</a></span> of current contract language proposals from both sides in which SAG-AFTRA accused game companies of wanting to retain overly broad loopholes that would effectively render the whole AI protection provision moot. One particular sticking point is a carveout that would let companies create digital replicas using any existing in-game performances from prior to the next contract, as well as any publicly available data like voice actors doing interviews on YouTube. </p><p>“Digital Replica and Generative AI protections only apply to services provided after this Agreement is signed,” reads the guild’s chart. “Previous game work (including Sideletter 6 games) and un-covered work (anything available in public; YouTube, websites, etc.) are carved out with no transparency, consent or compensation. This makes the entire AI protection provision useless.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA also accuses game companies of trying to get its members to turn on one another and of trying to “exploit” actors who don’t typically perform in games to fill roles during the ongoing strike. “I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry,” <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>’s Soldier 11 voice actor, Emeri Chase, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/emerichase.com/post/3lk5orkz76s2y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/emerichase.com/post/3lk5orkz76s2y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on social media today</a></span>.</p><p>Other game performers have also been replaced as the strike has continued, including actors for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. “My only concern is for my brand as a performer. Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer,” Zeke Alton, who plays William Peck, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game Developer</em> last year</a></span>. </p><p> “We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” a spokesperson for the game company bargaining group, Audrey Cooling, said in a statement. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.” </p><p>Meanwhile, story scenes in <em>Destiny 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have gone unvoiced in the new Heresy saga</a></span> and other roles risk being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recast at studios</a></span> that don’t sign onto interim agreements with AI protections.

Essentially, it starts with DrTankHead, a now-former moderator of the Balatro subreddit and also current mod of a NSFW Balatro subreddit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The moderator had expressed no issue with AI art content, both on the NSFW and main Balatro subreddits. "We will not be banning AI art here, if it is properly claimed and tagged as such," the mod said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7nz5q/opinion_from_localthunk_on_ai_art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a post</a>.

Then, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went to the subreddit to make a full statement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'.

They went on to say that it is "not their goal" to make the NSFW Balatro subreddit AI-centric, but they are considering a "day of the week" situation where "non-NSFW art that is made with AI can be posted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, one user replied: "Please just get off Reddit for a week or two."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That hasn't stopped tech companies going all in on AI, though.

But at least one <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> player has discovered a trick for getting absurdly fast clear times, using one particular quirk of Wilds' systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>, one Monster Hunter Wilds player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Zn-D8MkiU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an incredibly fast clear time</a> for a Tempered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Chatacabra">Chatacabra</a> bout, thanks to what seems like a curious exploit of the poison system. The actual fight itself takes upwards of nine minutes, but the quest gets cleared in 00'01"53.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick, it seems, is how poison triggers the actual quest start in Monster Hunter Wilds. Though the hunter in the video pelts the Chatacabra with quite a significant amount of Poison Ammo, keeping the debuff running, it doesn't actually start the quest until they stop the monster, launch the quest, and then deal the final blow.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players <a href="https://x.com/Carlos_R00/status/1899189639312757109" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have some theories</a>, mostly around poison not triggering the start of a quest as a safeguard against unwanted hunts starting in the open world. I took my own Heavy Bowgun out into the world and spent quite a while slowly toxifying a Chatacabra, and can at least report that it didn't automatically launch a quest until I started blasting it with other ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, it's an interesting little interaction. It doesn't seem to be a huge problem, as a super-fast quest clear doesn't mean much more than the actual quest clear at the end of the day. The Chatacabra dies either way, and honestly, this Poison Ammo seems both more arduous and resource-intensive than just bonking it with normal weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it proves that Monster Hunter Wilds players are still discovering weird, fun ways in which monsters can be hunted.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-500k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-top-500-000.1132581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sunblink has announced that&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone just 30 days after the game's release on PC and Switch.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-top-500000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the cozy life sim has reached 500,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been available as an individually-sold game for around a month.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>was actually released on iOS back in July 2023, but the game was part of the Apple Arcade subscription service (which will also be playing host to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade" rel="nofollow">first new&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years</a> come next month).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-beach.jpg?itok=S3xwmdXK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-beach.jpg?itok=x5OcjeZY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>has sold over 500,000 copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The game was subsequently released for PC and Switch in January, and presumably, it's those platforms on which the sales figures are based; after all, it's not possible to buy&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>as a separate purchase on iOS.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, it's a life sim based on Sanrio's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</em>property. It bears similarities to&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>; you'll be exploring and restoring a mysterious island, all while befriending its inhabitants (although this time around they are, of course, based on other <i>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</i>properties).</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, you'll also find lots of different areas and biomes to explore in&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, including a volcano, "the ocean's depths", and "an island in the clouds".</p>

<p>Of course, since the game is a life sim, you can also expect plenty of recipes to cook and craft, as well as the ability to renovate cabins on your island in order to attract new residents. You might even unlock new storylines involving those residents.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</i>right now on PC and Switch, and it's also available via Apple Arcade, with a PlayStation port on the way in the future as well. If you want to know our thoughts on the game, you can take a look at our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-funner-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow">preview from back in June right here</a>.</p>

You need to understand both of its modes <em>and</em> the unique mechanics to use it properly. That’s asking for a lot when compared with other weapons in the game, but we promise the damage it delivers makes this worth the extra effort.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>What makes the Charge Blade such a complex weapon is that it’s made up of two weapon configurations: Sword Mode and Axe Mode.</strong> The former equips you with a sword and shield for quick movement and defensive guarding; the latter combines the two into a heavy axe that sacrifices your defense and speed for powerful attacks.</p><p>Knowing when to swap between the two is naturally an important part of learning how to use a Charge Blade. Cycling between the two modes is vital for combat. A unique mechanic for this weapon will have you gather energy with your sword to then use for your axe, or to provide buffs to your equipment.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from offering two weapon modes, the Charge Blade’s defining trait is its Phial mechanic. Underneath the Melee Weapon Sharpness gauge will be four icons to keep an eye on: a Sword, a Shield, an Axe, and a set of five phials. <strong>Landing hits in Sword Mode will gradually accumulate energy.</strong> The outline of the phials will turn yellow and then red to convey how much energy you’ve built up. Keep attacking and the icons will start flashing bright red to signal that you have too much, with your sword attacks bouncing off enemies until you’ve discharged the energy.</p><p>You have a few options for how to charge the phials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Basic Charge</strong> – This forms the basis of your gameplay loop. Activate the Charge command by pressing R2 + Circle or RT + B to store the energy in your phials. Do this when the Phials are yellow or red to fill up three of them, or all of them, respectively. The energy will then be consumed through the various Axe: Element Discharge moves, including the important Amped Element Discharge (AED) and Super Amped Element Discharge (SAED). You can enhance these even further by charging the phials twice in a row before going into Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Element Boost</strong> – Hold down Circle or B during the Charge animation to receive Elemental Boost. This is indicated by the Shield icon lighting up, although it’s not purely a defensive buff. Having this active will enhance your guard and make it possible to follow up an AED with an SAED in Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Condensed Elemental Slash</strong> – If you have Element Boost active, you can hold Triangle or Y during the Charge animation to activate Sword Boost Mode. Your sword attacks will deal more damage and will no longer deflect</li></ul><p>The basic gameplay loop is to charge your phials, consume them in Axe Mode, and then return to Sword Mode to charge again. I highly recommend activating the buffs for your shield and sword if you want to make the most out of this weapon. A lot of extra damage will be left on the table by not making use of them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There is another buff tangibly related to the Phial mechanic. Power Axe Mode, commonly referred to as Savage Axe by fans, will significantly increase the heavy weapon’s effectiveness.

                <p>Lenovo might not be the first place you’d expect to find DualSense Controllers on sale, but it’s currently the best place to buy models in the Deep Earth lineup. Head over to the retailer and use promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> to get the <a href="https://howl.link/kah0afkv6gzak?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964641119?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volcanic Red</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/4rdw54vgl4q2s?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417963320617?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sterling Silver</a>, or <a href="https://howl.link/c4hsbc2qatcx0?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964545581?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cobalt Blue</a> DualSense for PS5 and PC for just $54 (was $80). That makes them <strong>slightly more affordable than they were during Black Friday</strong>--so if you missed out on those deals and need an extra DualSense or two, now's a great time to pick up one of PlayStation's coolest models.</p><p>While Lenovo is advertising the promo code GAMEON, that one has actually inspired. But using promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> will still let you snag these premium designs for cheap, so make sure to apply the code before finalizing your purchase.</p><p>The Deep Earth lineup might look more premium than the average DualSense, but these are still just your standard DualSense controllers. That means you won’t get the customization features found on the Edge. They still benefit from a built-in microphone, adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a rechargeable battery, making them the ideal choice for most gamers.</p><p>The standard DualSense, unsurprisingly, earned the top spot on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">best PS5 controllers</a>.

In it, players will be able to manage their herds, migrate across regions, and establish dominance in the Great Steppe.

Khans of the Steppe is scheduled to release on April 28 and will cost $20 if purchased separately.</p><p>While Khans of the Steppe isn't available until next month, those who purchase the expansion pass can receive the Crowns of the World update immediately. It's a cosmetic-based update that gives players six crowns, four hairstyles, and two beards to customize their rulers further.</p><p>The Coronations event pack will launch sometime between July and September. It includes a new activity called Coronations, which lets players legitimize their rule through grand ceremonies.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition brings <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-ray-tracing-improvements-comparison/">significant visual improvements</a> to the fifth entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games, but a new mod that was released online a few days back introduces even more stunning improvements that bring the game's realism to new heights.</p>
<p>The ChromatiX Enhanced mod v0.1 public beta, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChromatiXGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, introduces some very welcome visual improvements to the recently released Enhanced Edition, such as increased traffic and pedestrian density, improved lighting and atmosphere for all weather conditions during day and night, increased reflection intensity, brighter nights, enhanced night sky and more. Even in this early version of the mod, the end results are stunning, as showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@INTERGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTER.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 5 Enhanced with Realistic Graphics Mod!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ONpLNCvagBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While many are having issues with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, specifically regarding GTA Online account migration, there's no denying that the improvements Rockstar Games has introduced to the game are an excellent reason to revisit the game and possibly bring new players in. The introduction of ray tracing, DLSS, and FSR support, among other things, also bode well for the inevitable PC port of Grand Theft Auto VI, which will launch sometime after the game debuts on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy version</a> is also still available for purchase to allow those who don't meet the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">system requirements</a> to continue playing the game.</p>

A cute but dangerous alien crash lands on Earth, pretends to be a dog, and becomes the pet and best friend of Lilo. Of course, as you would expect, shenanigans ensue. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is set to arrive in theaters on May 23. Here’s the first official trailer: </p><p> <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>stars Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai. The original voice of Stitch, Chris Sanders, is back behind the now CG incarnation of the alien. He wrote and directed the OG animated film back in 2002. Sydney Agudong also stars as Lilo’s sister and guardian Nani Pelekai. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The live-action remake was announced all the way back in 2018</a></span>. Since then, the film has gone through a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous development</a></span>, with different directors and writers hopping on and off the project. At one point, <em>Wicked </em>director Jon M. Chu was attached to this thing! Wild. There was also casting controversy, too, with at least one actor replaced before filming after people spotted them using some slurs online. </p><p>But after all that,<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is finally coming to theaters, and after watching this first trailer my reaction is: Ehh... okay. Fine, whatever. Meh. </p><p>I understand that my love of the original will make it nearly impossible for me to be impartial about this new remake, but I just don’t think we needed this movie. Stitch seems mostly okay, but the trailer feels really flat and people seemed bored to be involved. The kid seems uninterested in what’s happening, likely because she’s a child and is being asked to act alongside nothing or blue-covered tennis balls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember those stories of how the kids in <em>ET </em>cried because they thought he had died on set</a></span>? That ain’t happening in an era where every film uses CG to create their alien characters. </p><p>Regardless, I get that Disney wants money and I know that kids aren’t as into 2D animation or even CG animation anymore, and prefer live-action stuff. As a result, we are getting a live action remake of basically every Disney movie ever made, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including the horrendous-looking <em>Snow White</em></a></span><em>.</em> And yeah, to be clear: This  movie and Disney’s other live action remakes are all for kids. So while I don’t mind dunking on it or laughing at people posting jokes about the new trailer on Twitter, ultimately, what will determine if <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is a success is if kids drag enough parents to the theater in May. We’ll find out this Summer. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero during Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 across both competitive and quick play. But the duo’s massive popularity isn’t deterring the balance team at NetEase from giving them a significant buff to their direct healing ability.</p>



<p>An already incredibly pick rate for Cloak &amp; Dagger could skyrocket even more after this next Marvel Rivals balance update.</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-will-get-buffed-in-marvel-rivals-season-1-5-balance-update">Cloak &amp; Dagger Will Get Buffed in Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 Balance Update</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mid-season balance update for Season 1.5,”</a> Cloak &amp; Dagger is receiving a strong buff to the direct healing power of Dagger’s Lightforce Dagger. <strong>The direct healing effect from Lightforce Dagger on hit allies is increasing from 10 to 16</strong>. To balance this, the “spell field healing amount” that heals another nearby ally is being reduced from 18 to 16. </p>



<p>While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger’s ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s full “clip” of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger’s Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes to Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to Marvel Rivals pick data websites <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a> and <a href="http://While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger's ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger's full &quot;clip&quot; of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger's Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>, Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero in both competitive and quick play. Both sites claim Cloak &amp; Dagger has a 50.44% pick rate in competitive play. The next highest is Invisible Woman at 44.39%, and then it’s a big drop down to number three: Rocket Raccoon at 28.99%. RivalsMeta tracks far fewer matches for quick play matches, but lists Cloak &amp; Dagger as the second most picked hero in that mode behind Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Human Torch and Iron Man will also receive changes in the mid-season balance update for Season 1.5. Human Torch’s primary Fire Cluster projectile speed and count are increasing, and his Supernova ultimate is getting a damage increase but with an increased energy cost. The direct damage of Iron Man’s primary Repulsor Blast is getting decreased, but the damage dealt by the pulse is increasing.</p>

Whether by chance or fate, its prototype space station, the Tiqqun, finds itself cast adrift, a disintegrating ark upon which the remnants of humanity must find sanctuary – and you, Administrator, are at its helm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>IXION</em> is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.</p><p>There are no simple solutions; your <a title="Genres > Action [2,554 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will have repercussions, now or further down the line.

Six sectors can be unlocked within the station, each able to house more population, support new jobs, and provide opportunity to monitor the crew with the Data Listening System. Will you bring hope to the people?</li><li><strong>Choices in the Dark</strong> – Who said DOLOS was the only faction to escape the fate of the Earth? Brush up against other pockets of survivors, navigate on from the failures and wrecks of others… <em>IXION</em> will lead the player through gripping chapters of story, where new threats and opportunities are presented, all in aid of reaching the final destination, a new home.</li><li><strong>Frontier Academia</strong> – DOLOS are famed for their innovative technology, their scientists, but the Tiqqun now finds itself cut off. Find what resources you can, research what you do not have. Find new ways to provide for your settlement, construct new buildings to create what’s needed. Modify the Tiqqun station, improve it, forge ahead in this odyssey.</li><li><strong>Occupational Hazards</strong> – Space is a dangerous place. Hull breaches, overloaded power supplies, electrical fires… It is up to you to manage these risks, deal with emergencies, create backup power solutions, and enable Extra Vehicular Activity…</li><li><strong>Stellar Exploration</strong> – There are whole new stellar maps to explore. Send out probes to reveal what’s hidden, create mining and cargo ships to find resources, commission science expeditions to discover the secrets and threats you’ll find out there in space. Encounter other survivors and bring them into the fold of your mission, objective – survive.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>expansion in the form of&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em>, and it's the first part of the game's fourth "chapter".</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/535470580526219410" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Paradox reveals that&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will launch on April 28th, and that it'll begin "the next stage in <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s development". As with previous&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-crusader-kings-3-expansion-highlights-royal-court" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will add a number of new gameplay mechanics and features.</p>

<p>Since the expansion is based around the Mongols, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the first major feature is a nomadic government system. You'll be tasked with exploiting the resources in your current location, then moving on to a new place with more resources to reap.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=CmR1jb9G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=WOPY1SXn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>expansion will add nomadic governments and more.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as nomadic government,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a Herd system that will represent your "horses, cattle, and overall strength within the steppe", and it'll serve as the "cornerstone of diplomatic, martial, and economic actions" in the new expansion.</p>

<p>The new Dominance system will also measure your power and influence within the steppe, and Paradox says that if you manage to raise your Dominance high enough, you "might even claim the mantle of Genghis Khan; the Universal Ruler".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to "changing climate and weather patterns" affecting your life in the steppe; you may, for instance, have to contend with sudden snows "decimating fertility and putting pressure on you to find greener pastures".</p>




<p><em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>may be&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s first Chapter 4 expansion, but it's not the main event; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, which will, as the name suggests, expand the game's map to encompass Asia.</p>

<p>You can look forward to new cultures, faiths, and more in this expansion, as well as a new Dynastic Cycle system that will have you attempting to maintain the Mandate of Heaven to prove you can "navigate the empire through treacherous waters".</p>

<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>yet, but the first dev diary is set for May, with regular dev diaries for&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>also due to air throughout April until the expansion's release.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s game director Carrie Patel has been on the blower to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains">Eurogamer</a> about why Avowed doesn't have any romance in it, which is to say it does, actually, if you're paying attention, and also, affairs of the heart aren't supposed to feel like min-maxing your Wizard, Kevin. To put that another way, she has gently suggested that relationships are more relatable when they aren't some kind of mechanic or system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she told Eurogamer's Robert Purchese (HELLO BERTIE). </p>
<p>As Purchese adds, Avowed does actually harbour the possibility of a soulmate, but this isn't served up to you Commander Shepard-style on a bed of amorous tooltips. It'll happen if you get to know the person in question and decide that you like them.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them," Patel explained. "But if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>
<p>I'm still playing through Avowed, and have no idea who this is referring to, so you'll have to do your own homework, you scamps. Also, I tend not to romance people in RPGs because I am afraid of emotions, and also because look Morrigan, we are trying to save the world here, there'll be time to knock boots after the credits roll. Ah, many are the sparks I have allowed to fizzle out. Sometimes the horny design gets the better of me, admittedly. I was appalled to learn at the end of the original Dragon's Dogma that I'd been seducing the local blacksmith all along. </p>

If you want, you can shut off crossplay by navigating to the <strong>Game Settings</strong> page via the main menu—not the in-game pause menu—then scrolling down on the first tab until you find <strong>Crossplay</strong>, then turning it to <strong>‘Off</strong>.’ Simple!</p><p>But don’t do that if your goal is following this guide! In fact, your entire squad must have crossplay enabled if you wish to utilize all of the game’s multiplayer mechanics, including Squad functionality.</p><h2 id="h1841725"><a id=""></a>There’s a catch, however!</h2><p><strong>You don’t unlock multiplayer from the start in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>. It requires <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015">a relatively streamlined grind</a></span>. You’ll unlock the ability to join a lobby and invite squad members during <strong>Chapter 1 - Back to Camp</strong>, the game’s second story mission. It doesn’t take long to reach this point; under an hour or so if you’re quick-moving and frantically slapping creatures aside with reckless abandon. Everyone you want to play alongside needs to have done the same.</p><h2 id="h1841726"><a id=""></a><strong>How about cross-save functionality in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>?</strong></h2><p>Okay, cool. You can play flawlessly with hunters from across the world on numerous current-gen systems and PC. But what about cross-save functionality for when <em>you’re</em> the one playing across multiple systems?</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently does not allow for cross-save progression. Your gameplay, story progress, and character creation data remain locked to whichever system you’re playing on. If you decide to hop from PC to PlayStation 5, for example, you must start a new game, a new hunter, and grind through the story and monster hunts a second time.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you don’t have a buddy or two to hunt with, the game’s camp lobbies allow for up to 100 players simultaneously, and you can party up with any of them, so long as you have crossplay enabled!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike involving video game performance actors is set to continue after the latest negotiations have failed to result in a new deal. In an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update posted</a> on its official website Tuesday night, the union’s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland for the video game strike says there has been progress in some areas, but it’s not enough to curb the concerns the union has about “A.I. Abuse”.</p>



<p>“Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to A.I. abuse,” the statement reads. “The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “bargaining group” wants to paint a picture than a deal is close. Crabtree-Ireland says that it’s not the case and it’s part of a hope to have union members “turn on each other”.</p>



<p>“They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract&nbsp;without&nbsp;any of the protections being bargained at all,” Crabtree-Ireland wrote. “You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;did with it.”</p>



<p>In response to the latest statement from the union, representatives on behalf of the studios provided a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. </p>



<p>“”We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15 percent for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” spokesperson Audrey Cooling said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p>



<p>The current video game actor strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July 2024</a>.  Despite it continuing, however, the union says that “more than 160 games” have signed interim and independent agreements to allow them to work wit SAG-AFTRA members.</p>



<p>“Those agreements contain the protections we have been asking the bargaining group for — terms that are clearly feasible and acceptable to a great number of game companies of all sizes, even as the bargaining companies resist,” the union says.</p>
