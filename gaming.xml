			<p>Put thoughts of the John Travolta and Christian Slater film to one side, as outside of the name referring to nuclear weapons going missing, Broken Arrow is not related in any way. Instead this is a tactical modern era wargame looking to take on the RTS niche when it launches in June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For our hands on time with Broken Arrow, we jumped right in at the deep end, playing multiplayer with a bunch of far more experienced players who had already sunk hours and hours into the game. In a way, this was actually the best way for a newcomer to see how the game works, with a 5v5 tussle for control over objectives spread across the map. Going toe-to-toe with players that have already figured out the ins and outs of how the game works wasn’t going to go well, so instead I was able to focus on smaller, less pivotal control points, while soaking in the action going on elsewhere.</p>


<p>Broken Arrow emphasises the more tactical aspects of warfare. There’s no base building here, but you do all bring your units out from set spawn points, having them race across the map in the early parts of battle to try and quickly establish frontlines and defensive positions with as many of the map’s control points in your hands as possible.</p>
<p>Units are broken down into six categories, with speedy recon units, infantry, tanks, support, artillery and air, drawing from the two sides of this particular war – the US and Russia. However, there’s a lot of crossover between these categories. Just summoning a squad of soldier is going to be pretty useless when it then takes them 15 minutes to sprint from one side of the map to even the closest objective, so you typically want to spawn them within an armoured transport to get them closer to where they need to go, or a helicopter, if the risk of being shot down is worth the reward of the amount of time you save.</p>


<p>And that risk is very real. Even from the opening moments, fighter jets start zipping across the map to deal quick missile strikes on advancing tanks, then countered by surface-to-air missiles that see them spew decoy flares to try and make an escape. Once that SAM has fired, it’s then in a known spot, which makes it a ripe target for artillery and surface missile fire, which in turns reveals fresh targets for fighter jets. Each time you peel back the fog of war to fire off a barrage, it brings the risk of a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use that fog of war to your advantage. I spent the latter stages of my first battle building up an infantry assault force, moving them through the woods and holding station until the final minutes of the battle, where I could rush a lightly defended control point (alongside a rather danger close missile strike) and capture it right with minimal risk of reprisals.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this for my second match, on a more watery map with an out-of-the-way control point, I then started to put my soldiers in choppers to avoid slower submersible vehicles being spotted and blown up, had a SAM for cover, and spread out soldiers with IGLA launchers handy to then hold the control point from any aerial assaults.</p>
<p>This was all for nought as the battle in the middle of the map went the other team’s way, and my efforts to push back onto the mainland docks were quickly rebuffed by a handful of defending units tucked up in buildings and woodland. Multiplayer battle play out through three phases, with points awarded for area control as well as casualties.</p>

<p>A much better way to get a handle on the game is to go through the initial training and single player missions, though. We had access to a pair of scenarios, one from each side, with an airbase assault and a mission to capture and hold a power station.</p>
<p>Both of them really highlight the need for good scouting and situational awareness. The runway capture mission starts with sending in airstrikes to clear air defences before paratroopers come in to secure a beachhead, but they quickly need airlifted reinforcements to stave off the counter attacks from bases further away on the map. The power station assault puts you more in the middle of a combined assault, giving you a handful of key units in a wider front and objectives that are built up with multiple buildings to provide great cover to tank-busting infantry, while the enemy counter offensives alternate between the two. It starts to get hairy as long range artillery comes to battery your positions and the tide gradually turns the screws against you through the mission.</p>
<p>While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game, there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leenzee and publisher 505 Games have announced the release date for upcoming China-set Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, and it's adding to what will already be a pretty stacked summer.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498319683381887449" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game will be launching on July 24th across PC and current-gen consoles. It joins the likes of shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-release-date" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>&nbsp;</em>and cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>.</p>

<p>As is customary for modern games, pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also get you some extra goodies. You'll receive two outfits, a new weapon, and a Glistening Mercury upgrade item if you place your order before the game's launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=NnNL2VC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=SwuDFnk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>lands in July. This guy, on the other hand, looks like he's landing a lot sooner than that.</figcaption></figure><p>A Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also be available, and it'll net you four more outfits and four weapons, as well as a Blood of Changhong skill upgrade item. Of course, you'll be able to obtain plenty of those items throughout your journey, but it's nice to have a headstart.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG set in the Shu kingdom during the late Ming dynasty. You'll play as the titular Wuchang, a pirate "struck by amnesia" who must contend both with her uncertain past and a horrific disease known as the Feathering.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll face "grotesque abominations", explore "forgotten temples" and "overgrown ruins", and "piece together Wuchang's lost memories". It all sounds pretty much par for the course when it comes to Soulslikes.</p>

<p>You can check out a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, which shows off a rather unsettling boss by the name of the Perfect Bride, right here.</p>




<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9nprhd8gqkqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th. It'll also be available as part of a Game Pass subscription if you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

            <p>
I never played enough of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> to be seriously annoyed by its infamous level scaling system, but I gather from the anguished recollections of colleagues that it was like having a fistfight with a mirror. You'd pour all that blood and sweat into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s obtuse skill-massaging systems, and the simulation would toughen up in response, with hitherto modest bandits showing up garbed in armour and items that matched your capabilities. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's probably a life lesson in this. Something about, you know, not trying. Something about accepting that "progression" is a joke, that all our of feats are dust in Creation's compound eye, that we neither deserve nor are capable of change. Oh wait, hang on, the level scaling was a massive error of judgement! So sayeth original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith, speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/">Videogamer</a>, which invites the question: why haven't they gotten rid of it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>?
</p>
<p>
As Nesmith notes in the interview, the Remastered version's creators have made some significant adjustments to how you gain levels. Instead of improving major skills and then sleeping to boost your attributes, depending on said major skills, the new version of the RPG doles out XP per skill-up and lets you pick which attributes to improve.
</p>
<p>
"They actually went ahead and changed the game design underneath... some of the systems design," Nesmith commented. "That's pretty much unheard of in a remaster because the whole idea is that they want that old experience, so I consider that to be a very brave thing and probably help the Oblivion remaster to be significantly more popular - assuming they have done what they said and bring it to a more modern understanding of things, that's going to make the game more playable for modern sensibilities". 
</p>
<p>
So why is level scaling still in then? Today's kids are going to hate it, Bethesda, because they are, after all, kids. They still harbour the hope that they will someday amount to something, that there will be a measurable distance between what they are and how they began. 
</p>
<p>
Nesmith is as confused and horrified as you are, reader. "I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems," he told the site. "The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I'm intimately familiar with how both of those things work."
</p>
<p>
"I think the world levelling with you was a mistake and that's proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>," he went on. "That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like 'oh, it doesn't matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me"."
</p>
<p>
Are you an Oblivion survivor? I'm interested to read your doubtless seasoned thoughts about whether the level scaling system could be salvaged or improved somehow, rather than simply removed. I don't know whether it's been rejigged at all for the remaster - we've got somebody working on a longer assessment - but modders have already stepped in and stripped the fittings. Take this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">Unlevelled Item Rewards mod</a> from trainwiz, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> homage <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/underspace">Underspace</a> and also, the person largely responsible for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-the-scariest-skyrim-mod-ive-ever-seen">Skyrim's plague of Really Useful Engines</a>.

From the very first episode of Showtime’s split-timeline drama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yellowjackets-season-3-release-date-teaser-trailer-1851703052&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yellowjackets-season-3-release-date-teaser-trailer-1851703052"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a></span>, we witnessed someone being chased through the snowy woods, strung up like a piece of prized game, and devoured by her own team. We knew that cannibalism was eventually coming in this female version of <em>The Lord of the Flies</em>, where a high school soccer team grapples with mental illness and surviving the elements alongside the typical conflicts of girlhood, such as fighting over boyfriends and desperately trying to fit in.</p><p>With three seasons down (and supposedly two more planned), let’s rank the most haunting, skin-crawling scenes in <em>Yellowjackets</em> history so far.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-recommend-id="image://8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-recommend-id="image://8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ever since the plane crash, Coach Scott (Steven Krueger) was really going through it. First, he lost his leg and had teen Misty (Samantha Hanratty)—who has a giant crush on him—as his nurse. He was surrounded by mostly hormonal teenage girls who were getting into petty fights and conjuring mystical stories about the wilderness controlling them. They also abandoned all sense of morality and ate their teammate.</p><p>As the only adult figure in the group, he symbolized the order and authority that the Yellowjackets were slowly abandoning, and it seemed increasingly likely that Ben was going to meet a grisly fate—especially after he refused to participate in eating their frozen former teammate Jackie (Ella Purnell) and escaped from the girls after the cabin burned down. He only rejoins them when Mari (Alexa Barajas) snitches after finding him in the woods. Despite his heartfelt pleas during the trial for allegedly destroying the cabin, the girls turn on their teacher and nearly execute him while he’s blindfolded. When Akilah (Keeya King) has a vision that he is their bridge home, they decide to keep him alive. </p><p>Coach Scott’s demise is like something out of a torture-porn movie. Each day, he becomes more and more emaciated, lying unmoving in his own filth; his Achilles tendon is sliced, and his will to live is completely eroded, begging to be mercifully killed. Teen Nat (Juliette Lewis and Sophie Thatcher) finally gives him what he’s been longing for by stabbing him; he dies not with pain or fear, but with a look of pure relief. We may have expected Ben to die eventually, but not in such a slow and excruciating way. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-recommend-id="image://e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-recommend-id="image://e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a lot of hunting and killing of animals in <em>Yellowjackets</em>, but Taissa (Tawny Cypress and Jasmin Savoy Brown) kills two of them in horribly gruesome ways. Taissa is one of several characters in the teen timeline dealing with mental issues, as she often hallucinates a creepy man with no eyes and experiences episodes of sleepwalking, during which she does strange and aggressive things like eating dirt and possibly burning down the cabin. When Tai starts sleepwalking again as an adult, the family dog, Biscuit, goes missing at the same time—devastating her young son, Sammy. Tai wonders if she let Biscuit out the gate during one of her nightly adventures, but her wife discovers the grisly truth: she killed Biscuit and placed his head and heart on an altar as a sacrifice, next to a drawing of the mysterious wilderness symbol in blood.</p><p>Also, in the teen timeline, Tai helps Van (Lauren Ambrose and Liv Hewson) practice making the experience of killing something feel peaceful and in harmony with nature. She holds up a rabbit from one of the traps, listening quietly to its fearful breathing as she presses a knife against its trembling little body. Then, she swiftly slits its throat. The camera doesn’t cut away as the blood pours from its neck and the poor thing twitches. These scenes are especially upsetting if you’re sensitive to animal cruelty. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-recommend-id="image://543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-recommend-id="image://543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Shauna’s (Melanie Lynskey and Sophie Nélisse) rage calcifies in season three and leads to her being crowned Antler Queen, but we see its origins in the first two seasons when she loses both her best friend and child. For as much as Shauna mourns these losses, she is also enraged by them. She becomes a ticking time bomb that could set off at any moment. Shauna freaks out and decks Misty for humming a song that she heard in her chicken baby nightmare. Lottie (Simone Kessell and Courtney Eaton) decides to offer her body to Shauna as a way to release her rage, knowing they need Shauna mentally stable for the good of the group.</p><p>Shauna smashes her foot into Lottie’s stomach over and over, then moves Lottie flat on her back to deliver sharp, smacking punches—practically salivating with each blow. At one point, she even uses both fists at once. Lottie’s face grows increasingly unrecognizable; her eyes are reduced to slits, her flesh a swollen mound. Her consciousness fades, and she becomes nothing but a bloody pulp. When her face flies straight into the camera after Shauna’s thunderous punch, it jolts you with its gruesomeness. The nostalgic soundtrack of “Lightning Crashes” by Live, a rock power ballad about motherly grief, perfectly complements Shauna’s postpartum outburst and voices her motivations for the carnage. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-recommend-id="image://ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-recommend-id="image://ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the most shocking moments in <em>Yellowjackets </em>is when a pair of frog scientists and their guide stumbles upon the girls howling at the moon and dancing around the fire in yet another cannibalistic ritual—this time with Coach Ben’s head on a platter. Their unexpected appearance is a connection to civilization, a jarring reminder of what the team has left behind in their warped tribe. For a brief moment, it feels like a chance at rescue and finally returning to their families is possible.</p><p>And then all hell breaks loose when Lottie, unwilling to leave the wilderness she now sees as home, takes an axe to the back of one of the frog scientists’ heads. The camera doesn’t shy away from this brutal view of his brain being spliced and blood spurting everywhere; it’s one of the goriest shots in the series. When Edwin (Nelson Franklin) hits the ground, Lottie smears his blood across her mouth—and it almost looks like she’s eating the brain matter spilling from his skull. It’s a disgusting image, but what makes it truly dreadful is the thrill Lottie gets from it. In that moment, it becomes clear why the adult Yellowjackets are so secretive about what really happened out there.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-recommend-id="image://5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-recommend-id="image://5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the teen timeline builds up to Shauna becoming the wrathful Antler Queen, the adult timeline gradually strips away her veneer of a quiet, suburban housewife. Shauna hunts Melissa (Hilary Swank and Jenna Burgess) down and accuses her of causing all the strange things that have happened lately, like cutting her brakes, trapping her in the freezer, and even killing Lottie. In a rare moment of female ferocity and a need to physically dominate, Shauna pins Melissa to the ground by straddling her. And then, Shauna does the unthinkable: she takes a bite out of Melissa’s arm, slowly tearing off a chunk of skin, then holds it delicately between her fingers. In that chilling, soft voice of hers, she demands, “Eat it.” Reluctantly, Melissa does. The Yellowjackets’ macabre obsession with cannibalism, now twisted into self-cannibalism, completely boggles the mind and churns the stomach. Shauna’s level of depravity and the lengths she’ll go to assert control seem to know no bounds.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-recommend-id="image://6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-recommend-id="image://6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The events in this episode don’t get as much attention as all the cannibalism and killing, but Travis goes through an equally traumatic ordeal at the hands of the girls. Misty drugs everyone with shrooms for their own version of a homecoming dance—what they call ‘doomcoming’—and everyone except Jackie gets high as a kite. After Travis (Kevin Alves) and Jackie (Ella Purnell) sleep together, the girls burst into the cabin, howling like banshees with wild looks on their faces. They throw Jackie into the food pantry, sit Travis down in a chair, and start ripping off his clothes while making out with him. It’s filmed in a very surreal way, with tight close-ups and sped-up motion. When they start clawing at his belt buckle, he imagines them as creatures with sharp teeth and black eyes. Travis says stop, but the girls chase him throughout the woods with a knife, imagining him as a stag to catch. They finally tie Travis up, shove a pinecone in his mouth, and nearly slit his throat. While they are high on mushrooms and starving, which has completely messed with their senses, that doesn’t excuse their actions. It seems there’s no end to their cruelty in the unchecked environment of the wilderness.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-recommend-id="image://e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-recommend-id="image://e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As the youngest person to survive the plane crash, Javi (Luciano Leroux) is another symbol of innocence that meets a cruel fate. He smartly ran away during the hallucinatory orgy in season one’s “Doomcoming,” where the girls chased and nearly butchered his older brother. He doesn’t appear again until season two, when we learn he was hiding in a cavern warmed by a geothermal spring.</p><p>After staying silent and withdrawn for most of the season, Javi springs to action and tries to save Nat from being hunted by the feral Yellowjackets following their first card ritual to decide their next victim/meal. The girls are like sharks, their eyes black and glazed with delight as they chase their potential food. They run and scream after Nat until they reach an ice-filled lake, where Javi suddenly falls in. What’s truly chilling is how readily they let Javi drown. Misty even grabs Nat and pulls her away from trying to save him. </p><p>We see him splashing frantically beneath the freezing cold water. In a wide shot, it’s as if we, too, are watching from afar, seeing nothing but his arms helplessly flailing through a small hole in the ice. The girls quickly grab him as he begins to sink, not wanting to lose their next meal, and bring him back to camp tied up on a log to prepare for the feast. The cannibal scenes in <em>Yellowjackets </em>are always horrifying to watch; we are unsettled by the girls’ heartlessness, motivated by a pure survival instinct. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-recommend-id="image://a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-recommend-id="image://a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Season two of <em>Yellowjackets </em>was steadily building up to the end of Shauna’s pregnancy with her belly getting bigger by the day. At one point, she has a nightmare about giving birth to a twitching rotisserie chicken and then gnawing into it, bringing to mind David Lynch’s grotesque and surreal <em>Eraserhead</em>. When she goes into labor (fairly prematurely), it’s a horrific situation for any woman to give birth in, let alone a teenage girl: unmedicated, inside a rustic cabin in the middle of the woods, and during the freezing winter. Her labor and delivery nurses are her frightened young classmates, with Misty leading the charge, but taking the Red Cross Babysitting Training course twice is the extent of her medical knowledge. Even though Coach Scott is the only adult in the room, he cannot cope with the intensity of the moment and leaves (although, granted, he is also missing a leg and has a lot to deal with physically).</p><p>Sophie Nélisse’s performance in the scenes that follow takes your heart and squeezes it tight, especially after we’ve been duped by golden, dreamlike images of Shauna cradling her bouncing baby boy. Instead of a warm, roly-poly son placed in her arms, she’s handed a blanket that, we cannot see, but know holds his small, lifeless body. Shauna’s ear-piercing screams and desperate pleas of “Can’t you hear him crying?” are absolutely gutting—especially because she believes so strongly that her vision was real. Thankfully, the most disturbing fan theory that the Yellowjackets would eat Shauna’s baby doesn’t come to fruition, but the scene of her birth is still harrowing, especially for women who have experienced infant loss. Shauna’s grief ignites the rage that puts her on the path to Antler Queen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-recommend-id="image://632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-format="webp" data-width="3000" data-height="1995" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-recommend-id="image://632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-format="webp" data-width="3000" data-height="1995" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The last episode of the third season, “Full Circle,” finally reveals that the infamous “Pit Girl” from the pilot is Mari. Even though she could often be snarky, it’s impossible not to feel sorry for her when she draws the Queen of Hearts and ends up being hunted. Mari cleverly leaves her clothes behind to throw her teammates off her scent, but sadly, it’s not enough to avoid the pit—now lined with newly sharpened spikes that Travis had meant for Lottie. What’s so disturbing is, of course, the idea of the hunt itself—that former friends and teammates savagely chase her down, no longer seeing her as a living and breathing person with her own personality, but only as chunks of meat to sink their teeth into. It’s also in the way they capture Mari, stripping her without hesitation and hanging her upside down like a slaughtered animal, letting the blood out of her pale, thin body which dangles in the biting wind. Shauna demands a piece of her hair for her cloak, making a melodramatic claim over Mari’s body and soul. If more hunts follow in future episodes, they’re sure to be just as frightening.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-recommend-id="image://3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-recommend-id="image://3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>All during season one, you can cut the tension between Jackie and Shauna with a knife. They’re best friends, but since Shauna secretly envies the pretty team captain and is sleeping with her boyfriend, they’re more like frenemies. Jackie quotes <em>Beaches</em> and nails exactly how Shauna feels about her: “You’re so fucking jealous of me you can barely breathe.” These tensions come to a head during an argument when Jackie (rightfully) points out how insane the group is for sexually assaulting and attempting to kill Travis, as well as worshipping the wilderness as some powerful deity. Shauna kicks Jackie out of the cabin and she spends the night outside by the fire—only for it to die down, leaving her frozen by morning. Shauna’s screams when she discovers Jackie’s body are blood-curdling, her mouth gaping wide. She cannot stop trying to shake Jackie awake.</p><p>Jackie’s death is disturbing, but what’s even worse is what happens to her dead body afterwards. When the girls put her on a funeral pyre two months later, wind causes snow to blanket her body, leaving her unrecognizable and perfectly roasted. The smell becomes enticing to the starving teenagers, and they wander out in a daze before greedily eating her. The scene is filmed with fantastical shots of a Roman-style feast—the girls draped in togas and laurels, food oozing and drinks pouring into their mouths—quickly intercut with the grim reality of what’s happening to Jackie’s body. We see short but terrifying flashes of her flesh ripping, meat sliding between their teeth, hands gnawing. The sounds of the Yellowjackets’ excited gulping and gnashing sends a chill down your spine, knowing that this beautiful young girl with her own hopes and dreams ended up being eagerly devoured by her friends.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro has weighed in on the question of AI in game development, saying that AI is set to make human game devs obsolete within 50 years. He predicted that AI would be used to create narratives that are specially crafted towards each player individually.</p><p>Yoko Taro, best known for his work on the Nier series, spoke on AI as part of a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> roundtable for upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-releases-this-friday-limited-edition-still-available/1100-6531012/" data-ref-id="1100-6531012">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> alongside Jiro Ishii and two of The Hundred Line's developers.</p><p>The developers all agreed that AI will quickly become mainstream in game development, and discussed where that would leave the industry. "I think that AI will make all game creators unemployed. In 50 years, game creators may be treated like bards," Yoko Taro said, predicting a time where human-made game development will be seen as an obsolete craft.</p><p>When asked if AI had the potential to create the kind of fantastical stories that human developers make, the panel generally agreed that it would be able to reach that point. "I think that in the near future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated," Yoko added. "AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve."</p><p>Hundred Line director Kazutaka Kodaka added that this kind of AI-driven design would take away the ability for players to share the same experience of a game, making them less likely to become a worldwide hit.</p><p>As AI becomes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">increasingly common</a> in both the creative and technical side of game development, game-industry figures and bosses have weighed in on the technology.

<p>Tsentzelis later posted a full video of his transaction at the store, where a GameStop employee can be heard asking him to create a bundle with a minimum item quantity.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI doesn't need another trailer to get people excited about the game. On the contrary, the element of surprise would make its launch an even bigger success, according to a former Rockstar Games developer.</p>
<p>As part of a social media celebration of the 17th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto IV, which includes some interesting insights on the lead platform, which was the Xbox 360 due to how difficult it was to develop on PlayStation 3, and how the decision to delay the game to April 29th, 2008 was made four months before the original October 16th 2007 release date, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij commented on how they would handle Grand Theft Auto VI marketing cycle, saying that, if it were their call to make, they wouldn't release any additional trailer. There's already plenty of excitement for the game's release, and the element of surprise would make the release bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also:<br>
If it was my call I wouldn’t release any additional trailers.<br>
There is more than enough hype around VI and the element of surprise is going to make the release only bigger as an event.</p>
<p>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1917025732074655981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After releasing the game's announcement trailer in late 2023, Rockstar Games hasn't talked much about Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite the silence on the game, however, Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">reiterated</a> back in February that the game is still scheduled to release this Fall to contribute, together with Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, to what is shaping up one of the strongest ever for the publisher, though it could have been even stronger if the game launched on PC at the same time as console.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen much of Grand Theft Auto VI in action, the recent release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition</a> on PC allowed us to get some sort of preview of the tech that will power the visuals of the next entry in the series. From some tests, however, it's clear how the game will likely target 30 FPS on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as CPUs on par with those powering the current generation of consoles struggle to handle the game properly at above 30 frames per second.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-story-is-absorbing-but-dont-miss-its-challenging-endgame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 side content. It does not spoil the main story. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its astonishing, utterly absorbing story, I found little time for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s side content. For two dozen hours I stayed true to the mission and pushed onwards towards my goal of defeating The Paintress. Not that I could see much else to do; optional regions and objectives seemed few and far between. But upon reaching the final phase of the story, in which you unlock the ability to fly around the overworld map, my assumption about side content was proven totally wrong. This world is so much bigger and more impressive than I realised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soar up into the clouds and you’ll find scattered floating islands, each one home to the likes of a gladiatorial arena, casino, crimson forest, or something stranger. Push beyond the boundaries of the main continent and you’ll discover hidden doors, wild platforming challenges, and elaborate mazes. And, deep below the ocean surface, there’s the hardest boss of them all. Yes, there’s what seems like an entire other game beyond the main path, much of which is designed to be Expedition 33’s endgame. Clair Obscur isn’t solely a story-focused experience, at least not for those who dare to continue. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-serpenphare-1745922186325.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">High above the world map is one of Clair Obscur's most challenging foes. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Sandfall Interactive has taken an economical approach to side quests (understandable, considering the studio's small size.) You won’t find any of the sprawling side stories that make games like The Witcher 3 so beloved. Most of the optional regions are small – some are even a single ‘room’ viewed from a static camera, designed to evoke the pre-rendered backdrops of PS1-era Final Fantasy more than offer any kind of exploration value. For the story-hungry, there’s precious little beyond the dozens of Journals that recount the trials of failed expeditions before you. Small but nonetheless interesting lore drops (such as, for instance, the origin of the Nevron enemies you face throughout the story) do, on occasion, make the side content narratively richer, but this is not a pursuit for anyone expecting the same grand story ambition as seen in the main quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Expedition 33’s MO for side content is gameplay-driven. But while it’s all built on the same core concepts as the main campaign – simple exploration, turn-based combat encounters, and character buildcrafting – the activities available certainly have a very different flavour. For the most part, it's all designed to push those foundational ideas as far as they can possibly go. Exploration becomes trickier thanks to labyrinthine environments that require puzzle solving to progress, while incredibly powerful bosses demand both full mastery of the combat system and deep understanding of how to assemble your characters' stats, abilities, and equipment. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As with the main story, there’s space made for both the enigmatic and eccentric. Random doors found in both levels and the overworld will transport you to the Manor, a grand house filled with locked rooms. Each new door found breaks the seal on one of those rooms, granting access to the collectables inside. Opening up the whole house is naturally the goal, but there’s more hiding within its halls. A series of secret levers in the dining hall triggers moving architecture, which not only grants access to a hidden passageway, but also suggests there’s more concealed in the Manor than it first seems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger still are the Gestral-populated regions, where sentient paintbrush-like creatures ask you to solve quirkier problems. At the Flying Casino, for instance, a Gestral holed up inside refuses to speak to any human – overcome that issue and you’ll be rewarded with one of the more humorous costume options. Similarly, heading to the Gestral beaches will see you rewarded with swimsuits for your team (sure to become “fan favourites”, I’m sure), but you’ll need to succeed at a bit of running and jumping to net them. Some of the time that’s reasonably easy – a race through a basic obstacle course, for instance. But one beach asks you to climb an impossibly tall tower of precariously balanced junk, a feat that demands patient and precise platforming, not least because a single slip-up sends you right back to the start. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-casino-1745922206791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Flying Casino is one of Expedition 33's more eccentric pieces of side content. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining ideas from those aforementioned regions is the Painting Workshop. A monochrome realm hanging within an abyss, you must carefully navigate its pathways made of canvases and picture frames in order to approach an ominous sculpture. Finding the Workshop’s multiple entrances in the overworld will allow you to complete the sculpture and trigger a boss fight against the Lampmaster, a horrifying mass of arms, lamps, and a huge sword that requires you to solve a light puzzle between combat rounds. You fought this monstrosity much earlier in the game, but this version is substantially harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That difficulty doesn’t just apply to the Lampmaster – it affects Expedition 33’s side content almost universally. Abandoning the beaten path early on only to discover a boss clearly designed for the endgame is one thing, but it's another to arrive at the endgame and still feel totally underprepared. It quickly becomes clear that high-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the activities live by. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>High-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the endgame activities live by.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Gestalt Arena and the Endless Tower are classic JRPG-style battle gauntlets, asking you to succeed through a number of increasingly difficult fights. Meanwhile, lurking around the overworld are a variety of incredibly powerful adversaries, such as the ethereal Serpenphare floating around the sky islands to the north, or the titan-like Sprong that wades through the ocean. Even after you break through the 9,999 damage limit, inflicting pain on these creatures demands incredible skill and persistence. There’s no cheat code to bypass this – dropping down to story mode difficulty does little to augment your chances against them. These bosses demand that you put in the effort to train, improve, and refine your characters. In many instances, you’ll need to respec and reconfigure your team in order to focus on a boss’s weakness and bolster your defences against its specific attacks (suddenly it makes sense why you pick up so much respec currency during the campaign). If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of this, Clair Obscur’s endgame feels very much like its own experience, rather than the more typical “mopping up” of side quests that happens in an RPG’s twilight hours. I may have started my journey through it at level 50, but that’s effectively level 0 when it comes to the challenges that await. My approach has been to return to the campaign’s starting point and systematically complete each optional area I missed or avoided, which has created a more approachable challenge gradient. What was once a near-impossible task, marked with red “DANGER” text on the UI, is now an easily surmountable one. Completing challenges in this order will help elevate me to the right levels needed to take on the endgame’s true trial; another major boss who lurks deep beneath the ocean within the pages of Renoir’s Drafts. From what I understand, you need a party of level 90 characters to stand a chance against him. Right now, reasonably fresh out of the story’s finale, it feels like there’s a whole second game between me and it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I emerged into Expedition 33’s endgame, I was struck by the same feeling I had when I dived into the Depths that hide beneath The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Hyrule. All those sky islands, all those new lands, and all those ocean whirlpools signalled a wealth of extra things to do. I was also transported right back to my youth, when defeating Sephiroth was far from the conclusion of Final Fantasy 7 for me. Clair Obscur has its own versions of the Emerald and Ruby weapons, the Gold Saucer Battle Square, plus several of its own ideas on top. If you’ve truly fallen for Expedition 33, especially the combat and RPG stats side of things, then its side content and challenging endgame are an absolute must.

                <p>Fortunately for all us girlie pops out there, video games are collaborating with beauty brands more often these days. However, few are as stunning--or luxurious--as this one.</p><p>Genshin Impact and high-end beauty brand Charlotte Tilbury have come together to create <a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com/us/content/collaborations/genshin" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two special-edition beauty boxes</a> celebrating some of the makeup brand's best-selling products and beloved Genshin Impact hero, Mona Megisus.

Both boxes will be available to purchase starting on April 30 for a limited time only and while supplies last.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4483848-charlottetilbury%C3%97genshinimpactbeautyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483848" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4483848-charlottetilbury%C3%97genshinimpactbeautyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483848"></a><figcaption>An overview of the Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact cosmetic boxes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4483848-charlottetilbury%C3%97genshinimpactbeautyboxes.jpg"></figure><p>The Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact collaboration will consist of two limited-edition beauty boxes: the Starfell Treasure Box, and the Starry Miracle Box. The Starfell Treasure Box will retail for £55 (approximately $75), and features the following items:</p><ul><li>Charlotte's Magic Water Cream [15ml]</li><li>Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray [34ml]</li><li>Charlotte's Magic Serum Crystal Elixir [Deluxe sample]</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Eye Mask</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Compact Mirror</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Drawstring Pouch</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact In-Game Rewards [Primogems x160, Hero's Wit x5, Sanctifying Unction x5, Mora x50,000]</li></ul><p>The Starry Miracle Box, on the other hand, will cost £155 (approximately $209), and contains the following full-sized beauty products and accessories:</p><ul><li>Charlotte's Magic Cream [30ml]</li><li>Cryo-Recovery Eye Serum [15ml]</li><li>Charlotte's Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir [Full-size]</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Stickers</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Tote Bag</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Pin Badge</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Headband</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Makeup Bag</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact In-Game Rewards [Primogems x300, Hero's Wit x10, Sanctifying Unction x5, Mystic Enhancement Ore x10, Mora x50,000]</li></ul><p>It is important to note that the in-game rewards code found inside each of the boxes can only be redeemed through July 30, so be sure to use them sooner rather than later. Though you can purchase Primogems in-game, most of the included items are not available to buy in Genshin Impact, making them all the more useful.</p><p>Charlotte Tilbury MBE, founder and chief creative officer of the makeup and beauty brand, said she found "perfect harmony with the mystical form of Mona Megistus," which is in part what inspired the collaboration:</p><p>"The mysterious and mesmerizing astrologist shares my love for the stars and divine artistry, and we both have boundless passion and dedication, which allows us to think limitlessly and pursue our biggest and boldest dreams, whether it's in Teyvat or the real world!" Charlotte Tilbury MBE wrote in the press release. "That's why each magic box is Mona-inspired and filled with exclusive limited-edition collectibles, from a velvety makeup bag to cosplay essentials. There is something for everyone to love--it's the perfect gift for everyone from gamers to skincare lovers and more."</p><p>Earlier this week, GameSpot's own Lucy James was sent both the Genshin Impact Starfell Treasure Box and the Starry Miracle Box.

            <p>Nvidia have released the latest in an unusually frequent series of GeForce driver hotfixes, with the vast majority of identified issues affecting the newest RTX 50 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> specifically. <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">GeForce Hotfix Display Driver version 576.26</a> targets various crashing and flickering problems with, among others, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> – though it’s the growing regularity of these patch jobs that’s more disquieting than any particular instance of game breakage.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While driver hotfixes have been rare during previous GeForce generations, a recent flurry has seen them averaging about one every two weeks, from the 572.24 hotfix for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> startup crash on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> to the black screen scourge of 572.75, and now both the 576.15 and bumper-size 576.26 versions being deployed within the same day. Peering through their patch notes reveals that by far the most common thread is the RTX 50 series, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of their software stability.</p>
<p>I should say that I haven’t experienced any such problems myself while reviewing these cards, which performance-wise, range from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">pretty decent</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">enormously disappointing</a>. Still, I am but one hardware editor, and even the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/564309/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57626-released-42/">Nvidia forum post</a> announcing the latest hotfix leads into a raft of community replies reporting various continuing problems. Driver version 576.02, the most recent stable driver, is repeatedly identified as a breaking point, and with two hotfixes having now been sticky-plastered on top of it, the accusation carries some weight.</p>
<p>It's true that 'stable' drivers are faced with potentially meddlesome time restraints, as they’re usually released in support of either key new games or a new piece of hardware (the RTX 5060 Ti, in 576.02’s case). Still, that’s been the case with GeForce drivers for donkeys’ ages, so can’t really shoulder the blame for the sudden uptick in problems and resultant hotfixes. In any case, if you’ve been having hiccups with your own GeForce GPU, <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">give version 576.26 a download</a> and hope you won’t need another one for a while. It’ll need to be a manual installation, as hotfixes aren’t released through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a> like stable drivers are.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Composer Grant Kirkhope has shed light on why he wasn't credited by Nintendo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie for the inclusion of his DK Rap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2023 after the film's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-rap-composer-criticises-mario-movie-for-not-crediting-him">Kirkhope shared his frustration on social media</a>, calling the decision "fucking depressing". Other pieces of licensed music were fully credited.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Kirkhope explained how he spoke with Nintendo after the film's release but the company made the decision to not credit any music it owns - including the DK Rap.</p>

<p>"I did have communication with Nintendo as I wanted to find out why they just didn't put my name on it," said Kirkhope.</p>
<p>"They said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo. Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Bowser's Fury, another song used in the film but also owned by Nintendo, was likewise not credited.</p>
<p>Kirkhope heard from attendees of test screenings the DK Rap had been included, but he had assumed it was just test music and would be removed.</p>
<p>He added: "It's bizarre how they just sampled it straight from the game. They just plugged in the N64 and sampled it and looped it. There's no re-recording done, straight out the game. So it's me playing guitar on it. It's the lads from Rare doing the [sings] 'D-K' thing. They're all the performers on the track. So they're all in the movie uncredited."</p>
<p>So if Nintendo owns the rights to the DK Rap, does that mean we could see it added to the Nintendo Music App anytime soon?</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Kirkhope. "They have put some of Dave's [David Wise] stuff on it. They do own it all so it's up to them. I don't think they ever really liked DK 64 that much. That's a rumour we got back through the cycle of whispers from Nintendo when we were at Rare. I don't know if that's true or not."</p>
<p>It's certainly notable that Donkey Kong 64 is one of the few games from the N64 not included on the Switch Online collection.</p>
<p>Still, it appears the theme of Rambi the rhinoceros will be in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, as a post in the Nintendo Today app suggests. Kirkhope himself replied on social media: "Well fancy that...Rambi lives."</p> <div>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Classic RPG remasters</a> drop from the shadows, surprise GOTY contenders <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">spring from the cracks</a>, but life goes on in the sleepy oxen-powered villages of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> from Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse. Well, not entirely.</p>
<p>Change is afoot in oxen country, as detailed in a round-up of update plans for the game’s first birthday. What did you get for your first birthday? I think I got: the continued affection and/or tolerance of my parents, after a year of being puked and widdled on. Manor Lords is getting: an upkeep system, various visual or UI rejigs, and a boost for the AI’s capabilities that ranges from non-player town-planning to the navigation of fortresses.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded by Grzegorz "Greg" Styczeń, Slavic Magic have grown since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publisher-reassures-players-struggling-to-buy-at-launch-that-well-run-those-25-discounts-often">the absurd success of the early access release</a>. “Since launch we’ve welcomed Nathan (map design), Tom and Kurtis from Flix Interactive (programming), Niklas (AI), Basia (2D art), Nicolas (3D art), and Darren and James (game design). We’re also still working with QLOC for QA needs — and more folks are helping behind the scenes, such as Daniel,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/573753783490708647?l=english">a merry Steam post</a>, before unleashing a horde of suheadings that “is not a full changelog or final list”, but “should give you a good idea of where development is headed.”  
</p>
<p>
Let’s get stuck in, then. As regards new buildings, they’re working on a quarry for “endless” stone mining on rich deposits, and a lime kiln that will be required for advanced construction. Planned visual changes include revamps for the UI and map resource nodes, and some overhauled castle pieces. But the juiciest bits appear to involve the AI, which can now build and run a small village, making use of concepts such as burgage plots, backyard and living space extensions that didn’t exist in the early access launch version. 
</p>
<p>
“A lot of work was done to make sure the AI could use the plot tool properly,” the devs add. “We're still working on improving its city planning skills and will soon start working on its trading capabilities and farming.” Letting the AI build villages has also obliged a new approach to the game’s marketplace, though the Steam post doesn’t go into detail.
</p>
<p>
The devs are also making changes to the Record View, with a new screen for regional production and consumption. They’ve tweaked the approval system so that recent events have more impact than older events. And they’re working on a contentious-sounding upkeep system, “which means a smithy will need a constant flow of tools, and deep mines need a flow of planks”. It’s terrible to see the concept of “flow” invading the hitherto stolid pasture lands of the Middle Ages, but I do find the thought of planks cascading down a mineshaft sort of poetic.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the theme of flow, there’s a nice bit in the post that breaks down the appetisingly maddening challenge of having units pathfind through castles that have several floors. “The whole world in Manor Lords was always coded in 2D, which made collisions simpler to resolve and made the game more optimized,” Slavic Magic explain. “However, this meant we can't have "proper" gates where people stand on top and walk below at the same time (they'd collide with each other). 
</p>
<p>
“I decided to investigate this and rewrite the pathfinding to support multiple floors," the post goes on. "However, it's still being tested whether the extra computation cost is actually worth it (it's literally only for the gates, which in theory can be cheated by garrisoning in and out from the gatehouse doors).” Read the rest for a not very medieval, but undeniably cool development gif of militant rice grains struggling to escape a spiderweb of waypoints. 
</p>
<p>
Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">liked the original early access version of Manor Lords</a>, to the point that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">interviewed the composers</a> and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">stalked a cow for clicks</a>. Slavic Magic had planned to keep the game in early access for “around a year”, but it sounds like 1.0 is a ways off.

            <p>The Russian government has threatened to seize the assets of studios behind free-to-play tank battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World Of Tanks</a>, according to state media. Russia has accused the game companies' executives of "extremist activities" in relation to the war in Ukraine, although they provide no evidence in the legal action. The seizure casts a grim shadow over both Wargaming (the original developers of the game) and Lesta Games, a Moscow-based studio who were once owned by Wargaming and who took over the free-to-play game in Russian territories. It's Lesta Games who seem to be taking the brunt of the government hostility.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The assets of Lesta Games were subject to a "statement of claim" by Tagansky District Court of Moscow on April 17th, reports <a href="https://ria.ru/20250426/genprokuratura-2013563207.html">Russian media site RIA</a> (translated by Google). The prosecutor general names Lesta's executive Malik Khatazhaev as the target of the seizures, but also the owner of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly. Lesta have filed a complaint in return to challenge the decision.</p>
<p>"The company is working in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus," said the developer in a Telegram group, as <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/04/2025/680a30609a794772af778315">reported by RBC</a>. "So we have no grounds for any fears or concealment of information. We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear."</p>
<p>To clear up any confusion, Wargaming are the original creators of the tank game - a studio that began life in Belarus but later grew to have studios across Europe, eventually heavily relocating their work to Cyprus. They bought the Russia-based studio Lesta Games in 2011. </p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2022. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Wargaming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-tanks-studio-fires-creative-director-who-voiced-support-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">fired a creative director</a> who supported Russia's aggression and later announced they were<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wargaming-are-closing-their-studios-in-belarus-and-russia"> cutting ties with their Russian and Belarussian studios</a> and would no longer do business there. World Of Tanks was still playable in those regions, though, and became managed by Lesta Games, who once again became a legally independent business. </p>
<p>None of that distancing and repositioning seems to convince the Russian government, however. CEO of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly remains named by the prosecutor general as part of an "association carrying out extremist activities" and is therefore a target of asset seizure. The prosecutor's claim attached headlines from the media reporting World Of Tanks events that showed support for Ukraine by raising money for ambulances (you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF43c5rpCE">a trailer for that event here</a>).</p>
<p>"Wargaming made a strategic exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets three years ago," said Wargaming in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/russia-moves-to-seize-world-of-tanks-developer-over-ukraine-support/">a response to VGC</a>. "The company disposed of its business in Russia and Belarus to the local management at zero cost and on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with no consideration to take it back. Wargaming doesn’t have any assets or business interests in Russia and Belarus."  </p>
<p>This isn't the first time Wargaming have been directly targeted by the Russian state for its sympathetic response to Ukraine. The company's chief business development officer was added to the country's terrorist watch list in 2023, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/belarusian-kgb-adds-world-of-tanks-studio-boss-to-terrorist-list/">PC Gamer report</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The voice artist behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Yennefer of Vengerberg has told Eurogamer that she doesn't know yet if her character will return in CD Projekt's in-development <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Work on The Witcher 4 ramped up in earnest last November, following several years of pre-production. Now, over 400 staff at CD Projekt are assigned to the game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">though it won't launch until at least 2027</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, we already know the basics - that The Witcher 4 is a continuation of CD Projekt's existing trilogy, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri will now be its protagonist</a>, and that hero <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Geralt has already been locked in as reappearing in some form, still voiced by Doug Cockle</a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about Yen? After Geralt and Ciri, sorceress Yennefer is arguably the next most important. Her relationship with Geralt is featured in numerous Witcher stories, and the character is also a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know any of this," claimed The Witcher 3's Yennefer, Denise Gough, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI_ObQcMOwv/?igsh=MWlrMWt3anFqZ21xbg==">when asked by my colleague Mat Jones</a> what she knew of CD Projekt's progress on The Witcher 4.
</p>
<p>
Gough - now starring in the Star Wars series Andor as Dedra Meero - went on to suggest she hadn't known what to expect when recording for The Witcher 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Eurogamer recently sat down with The Witcher 4's game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber</a> to try and tease some information about when the game will be set, and how much Geralt might appear.
</p>
<p>"Currently, he's having the best time of his life," Kalemba joked, when we asked whether Geralt would be back in action and playable at any point. "[He's] playing with some wine, and dealing with vineyards. This is where we left him last time. But obviously we can promise that Geralt will appear, but we cannot tell you if it's going to be playable or not right now. But yeah, he will appear. He's going to be present in The Witcher 4."</p>
<p>As for Netflix's TV adaptation, we just got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-peek-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-on-set-in-the-witcher-season-5">first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt</a> on set while filming its fifth season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The A Minecraft Movie team is leaning in - or trying to counteract - the viral rowdy cinema  behaviour memes by introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings.</p>
<p>These screenings will allow you to burst forth with your best Lava Chicken recital, while being backed up by a fellow chorus of Steves all there for the same thing. Or, you know, you can just yell out "Chicken Jockey" at the top of your lungs. The A Minecraft Movie lot wants you to "meme" along with the film.</p>
<p>In the words of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures: "You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan."</p>

<p>If this sounds like your thing, you can book tickets for A Minecraft Movie: Block Party Edition now, with the screenings themselves happening on 2nd May. Not all cinemas are participating, though, so you will need to check your local listings.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure exactly what I am talking about when I write words like "Chicken Jockey" or "Lava Chicken", well then truth be told I am a little jealous. My children know all about these memes already, and will periodically just come out with them in the middle of supper/homework/the night and so on. They haven't even seen the film…</p>
<p>Anyway, Chicken Jockey refers to a moment in the film where Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken. Jack Black's Steve then says "Chicken Jockey".</p>
<p>Now, that may not seem like much of A Moment to you or me, but a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when those words are spoken</a>. In fact, things got so chaotic, cinemas and Jack Black himself popped up asking people to dial it back.</p>
<p>In a clip shared on social media earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Black stood up in front of a cinema telling those present "absolutely no 'chicken jockey'"</a>.</p>
<p>"Lava Chicken", meanwhile, is a little ditty sung in the film by Black's Steve, about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40</a>. The song itself is only 34 seconds long, and you can listen along below. </p>

            <p>A few years ago I found an old hardback tome of Solitaire rulesets on a garden wall. It was a bright, unambiguously pleasant day and I remember thinking 'oh, that's the wotsit that inspired those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-genteel-verdict-regency-solitaire">regency thingamajigs</a>'. So I took it home and tried my hand at a few variations, then forgot about the book entirely. After reading about Occlude, I can only wish my discovery had been more ominous, more foreboding. Why couldn't I have found the book in a secret cellar, its hastily painted-over entrance given away by the motion of air through a dream-catcher? Why couldn't it have been thrust upon me by a desperate man with hypnotic tattoos, pushed into my hands with a precautionary mutter to 'Ware The Onyx Triangle?'</p>
<p>This is the ambience cultivated by Occlude, a "single-player cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> card game for the terminally curious", in which Solitaire is the basis for seven rituals involving Tarot cards, which steadily unlock access to an archive of fragmentary lore. Here's a trailer.<!--more--></p>

<p>I did enjoy my initial experiments with Actual Cardboard Solitaire. I've already forgotten the rules I picked up from that book, but I remember the gentle buzz of unhurried meticulousness, the satisfaction of stacks forming before me, and the sense of fathomless arithmetic at play beneath the table surface. It sounds like Occlude will be a touch more... agitating, partly because it could be an inventory of your character's awful past. </p>
<p>"Have you ever done something you regret?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547010/Occlude/">the Steam page</a> asks. "What if I told you there was a way to fix it? Make it so that something never happened at all; or perhaps, just happened differently. What if I told you it was as simple as a game of solitaire?"</p>
<p>The developers are Tributary Games, creators of political sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-the-castle">King Of The Castle</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-can-scheme-against-you-in-political-sim-king-of-the-castle">Kaan rather liked</a>. Occlude is "smaller and tighter than KOTC, but just as ambitious," the developers add in the announcement post. "It's Solitaire, yes, but much, much more. It's got puzzle mechanics, and a mind-bending narrative that's a puzzle in it's own right. It's a game that is one thing but also another."</p>
<p>I mean, I could say the same thing of my breakfast today - a peanut butter and jam sandwich. But I do respect the desire to take Solitaire and futz around with the workings via hearty injections of, in this case, "Lynchian horror".</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Tributary are running some kind of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3547010/view/505075100350939381?l=english">marketing conspiracy game</a> if you want to get an early taste of the setting. Me, I'm off to dig out that Solitaire rulebook in the hopes that there's, for example, a diagram of a strange and frightening constellation inside the dust jacket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/platinumgames-appears-to-be-hiring-for-an-online-action-game-despite-babylon%E2%80%99s-fall-spectacular-failure.1176069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/platinumgames-appears-to-be-hiring-for-an-online-action-game-despite-babylons-fall-spectacular-failure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Japanese developer PlatinumGames went through a rough patch with the launch of Babylon's Fall. The game published by Square Enix was the studio's first attempt at a live service title and it failed spectacularly, to say the least.</p>
<p>Despite a potentially intriguing setting, the execution was severely lacking, leading to poor critic reviews and <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-reaches-zero-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely low player numbers</a>. Francesco De Meo opined that a lot of the problems <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-babylons-fall-truly-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do with monetization</a>:</p>
<p><em>Where the monetization, Battle Passes, and GaaS features have impacted the game the most, in my opinion, is where it mattered the most in a PlatinumGames action title: combat mechanics. At the end of the main campaign, it becomes possible to change each weapon's attack mode to Power and Technical Mode, with the latter essentially making the game feel more in line with other, better games by PlatinumGames. Additional mechanics unlocked during the campaign itself, such as elemental attacks and properties and the Gideon Coffin mechanics, also make combat considerably more fun than at the start of the campaign. Later quests also feature a much better design, with different traps, light platforming, and more varied combat scenarios. Also, the endgame, although not much different in terms of game flow from the main campaign, is considerably more fun than the base campaign, and it is much easier to find players for stuff like Sieges and so on, better executing the multiplayer action game premise of the experience.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that it is clear that all these features and mechanics have been held back on purpose only to retain players and potentially make them buy future Battle Passes and premium currency. If the best-designed quests and advanced game mechanics would have been made available earlier, would the game have been received slightly better? I definitely think so. The game wouldn't have scored 7s or 8s all around, no question about it, but more reasonable 5s and 6s.</em></p>
<p>Babylon's Fall live servers <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went down for good</a> on February 27, 2023, less than a year after the game's launch. However, the Japanese developer still plans to work in the live service genre. As first <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/platinumgames-new-online-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by TechGamers</a>, they are <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/platinumgames/jobs/1-01-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> a Game Designer whose desired skills must include 'Experience working on online action game development' and 'Experience in level design for online or open field games'. Of course, it is possible that the studio would use Babylon's Fall learnings to make a much better live service product this time. At this stage, it is unclear whether this will be self-published or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on the single player action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which will be released later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

If you're unfamiliar, for years fans have meticulously speculated about a branching timeline that began in Ocarina of Time — one branch where adult Link defeats Ganondorf and one where he doesn't. It's a pretty interesting bit of lore that explains some of the settings in later and past games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia and Art &amp; Artifacts offer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/20-fascinating-facts-from-the-legend-of-zelda-encyclopedia">even deeper looks at the universe</a>, and include detailed breakdowns of the different items, characters, and enemies, as well as exclusive interviews with developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion is an over 400 page companion to the 2017 game. It contains countless design artwork and concept art, a look at the history of Hyrule, and interviewers with key developers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Guides</h2><div catalogid="89efae87-604d-4b30-ac6f-e2e995689a5b" id="219537"><div id="219537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - The Complete Official Guide: Collector's Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks in part to the internet, they just don't quite make video game strategy guides like they used to. These days, older guides from publishers like <a href="https://primagames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prima Games</a> and Brady Games have become steeply priced collector's items. There is, however, one massive hardcover official guide for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">2023's Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> that is currently available on the Nintendo Switch. This almost 500 page guide covers everything you need to know in the game, from every Korok location and cooking recipes, to dungeon solutions and boss fight strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you can also find all of that information in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">IGN's guide to the game</a>, but this physical copy is a great addition to your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

        <blockquote><p><em>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</em> is a Soulslike action RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty, plagued with warring factions and a mysterious illness spawning monstrous creatures.</p><p>Become Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior struck by amnesia, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past while afflicted by the horrific Feathering disease. Explore the depths of Shu, enhancing your arsenal and mastering new skills harvested from fallen foes. Evolve your fighting style by sacrificing elusive Red Mercury and further develop new techniques obtained throughout your action-packed journey. Augment the weapons in your repertoire with powerful enchantments, allowing for a unique approach to combat and strategy that suits your personal style.</p><p>Battle against grotesque abominations, drawing on ancient lore to challenge the creeping darkness that threatens the humanity that remains. Your quest for truth will take you through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins, and shadowed paths fraught with peril. As you piece together Wuchang’s lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings—each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust.</p><p>Immerse yourself in a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and breathtaking visuals that offer an unforgettable adventure through lands veiled in chaos and death. Will you reveal the truths of Wuchang’s curse and bring peace to Shu, or will you succumb to the encroaching horrors? The fate of the land rests in your hands.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.
