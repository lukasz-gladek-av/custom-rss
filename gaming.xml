<p>Yes, that little RPG about catching cute and not-so-cute monsters and doing battle with your pals has been going for three entire decades. In that time, it's evolved from mere gaming phenomenon that rejuvenated interest in Nintendo's Game Boy seven years after it launched to the world's biggest media property.</p>
<p>'If in doubt, stick a Pikachu in/on it' probably <em>isn't</em> a mantra at The Pokémon Company, but you'd be forgiven for thinking it is, given the proliferation of that particular 'mon across every facet of the franchise. The series' success, though, goes well beyond the near-universal appeal of the electric yellow mega mouse who became its mascot.</p>
<p>Anyone who's <em>ever</em> been a Pokémon fan has a story that sticks in their mind; a particular Pocket Monster you caught and named, a story moment that stuck with you, a tense, skin-of-your-teeth battle you triumphed in, or a more personal memory about where you were in your own life's story while playing Pokémon.</p>
<p>Or maybe something outside the games entirely! With the anime, TCG, and the wider world of Pikachu and co., it's become so much more than <em>just</em> the games.</p>

            <p>Brutal boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s first major post-release patch has arrived today, February 13th. Among its array of tweaks is a "partial" fix for a pretty serious issue - it sometimes being impossible for your character to down any healing elixirs in battle.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not difficult to imagine such an occurrence being a source of serious frustration in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a>, far, wherever you are, but if you had any doubts Sherif from our network mates <a href="https://www.vg247.com/nioh-3-patch-1-03-01-elixir-healing-bug-crash-fixes">VG247</a> has personally testified as much in pointing out the fix. I'd have asked our very own Jeremy to get double verification on this, however, knowing that the game pushed him to the point that he put a hole in his desk while playing it for review, I've decided to spare him the displeasure of having to recall any points when his healing abilities might have gone AWOL.</p>
<p>Beyond that and a bunch of other fixes - some of which are for specific bugs affecting bosses like Takasugi Shinsaku, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and Kajiwara Kagetoki - Koei Tecmo have made some broader adjustments to the game with this patch, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3681010/view/565900410925088838?l=english">version 1.03.01</a>. They've "greatly increased the Health of enemies in the Training Ground Battle Scroll and made it possible to pray at the shrine during battle" and "made changes so a backup copy of save data will be automatically generated when the player loads save data".</p>
<p>Personally, my favourite not from the patch is this one: "Fixed an issue where if the player selected 11, 32, 33, or 43 under Base Hair in Character Creation, they would be able to select 14 under "Hair - Back of Head (Top)" even if the hair was floating above the head." Begone, misbehaving trims.</p><p>Despite the toll it took on his furniture, Jeremy opted to give Nioh 3 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-review-a-superb-blend-of-soulslike-splendour">a bestest best</a>. "Wonky performance aside, Nioh 3 is excellent," he wrote. It's not as elegant and practiced as FromSoftware's efforts, and I daresay that the creativity present in recent Chinese soulslikes like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> isn't matched here either. But it still warrants a Bestest Best, because what this game does do is deftly borrow from modern titles in a variety of genres, mingling their flavours into one delicate Miso soup. There's a word in Okinawan - chanpurū - which means to mix together. That's what Nioh 3 is - a chanpurū of influences that manages to entertain in a wonderful fashion. Even if you're biased against samurai like I am, it's still worth your while to fire this one up, tackle the Crucible, and cuddle a Chijiko or three."</p>

              <p>PlayStation in the UK has paired up with a company called Raylo to offer rental options for a huge range of its hardware. For a whacking £24.49 ($33) a month you can get a 1TB PS5 you don’t own, or make that £28.49 ($39) if you want a second controller with it.</p> <p>Called PlayStation Flex, it purports to lease out PS5s and accessories “starting at £9.95 per month,” deliberately aimed at customers who aren’t able or willing to pay the full price up front. But the reality is much more grim.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join your friends on PlayStation 5 with Flex. Lease a PS5 Digital Edition console starting at £9.95 per month, for a limited time only: <a href="https://t.co/7O84kquQ89">https://t.co/7O84kquQ89</a> <a href="https://t.co/RCeCNQfdZF">pic.twitter.com/RCeCNQfdZF</a></p> <p>— PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/2021926500245639184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The “starting at £9.95 per month” claim in the promotional materials is extremely misleading. This is the price for the bizarre Europe-only <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">825GB digital edition of the PS5</a>, roughly working out to $13.50 a month, but crucially only at that rate if you commit to a 36-month plan from which it is very difficult to opt out. In reality, to rent that lowest-tier console for a month without a contract would cost you £19.49 ($26.50), more than twice as much as the implied price.</p> <p>For clarity, let’s focus on the <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-disc-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">1TB standard PS5</a>, which purports on the front page of the store to be available for £11.59 a month ($16), but for a single month would actually cost you £24.49 ($33). The same console, to buy and own outright, costs £479.99 ($654, with tax included in that figure).</p>

 <p>If you signed up to that 36-month (three-year) commitment, which you cannot cancel, at the cheapest rate this would cost you a total of £417.24. So maybe a bargain, right? That’s £60 cheaper than buying it day one! Except, no, because at the end of those three years you’ve spent your £417 on owning <em>nothing</em>. You have to give the PS5 back. The person who bought it for a not dissimilar price three years ago gets—most importantly—to keep it, and also has the option of reselling it to make back a chunk of their cash.</p>

 <p>This situation obviously gets considerably worse if you rent the PS5 for a shorter period of time. If you were unable to commit beyond a monthly rate (which of course is the case for many with low incomes looking to find cheaper access to this tech, unable to commit to 12-month contracts, let alone three-year ones), for the equivalent three years you’d have paid out £882 ($1202) for a console you don’t even own.</p> <p>Oh, and let’s not forget, we did all this math for consoles that come with just one controller. Run that again with a couple of DualSense included and it’s £450 at the cheapest, £1,026 at the monthly rolling rate. That’s $1400 for a console you didn’t buy. (And just for fun, the PS5 Pro? $834 to $1840.)</p>

 <h2>If you cannot keep up payments…</h2> <p>This becomes more insidious when you note the ease with which these contracts can be entered into. <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/#how-it-works">Sony’s store states</a> that applying for the deal takes “60 seconds,” and that “We only do a soft credit check and applying has no impact on your credit file.” Which is to say, it’ll allow you to sign up to a long-term contract costing hundreds of pounds without checking if you can afford it.</p> <p>There is nothing mentioned on the store pages for what happens if you’re unable to keep up your payments years after making the commitment, and the site’s AI assistant fought hard against telling me this, but eventually revealed that cancelling early requires having paid a minimum of 18 months of charges, plus that month’s and the next. So if you’ve signed up for two years but need to cancel after 12 months, you’ll need to pay another eight months’ worth of charges to get out of the contract. What happens if you can’t? It wouldn’t tell me. I’m waiting on a human response.</p> <p>Renting electronics was once a peculiarly popular phenomenon in the UK, with 1970s retailers like Radio Rentals and Granada renting out color TVs and washing machines to those who couldn’t afford to buy them outright. And of course those people would go on to spend far more in monthly payments than the item would have cost up front. There was another resurgence of this model, but <em>far</em> more predatory, in the 2010s with companies like BrightHouse working on a “rent-to-own” model, preying on those with the lowest income, designed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47452571">to trick customers into spending five times the real price</a>, although people did at least get to keep the product. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52090976">The company collapsed in 2020</a> under the weight of its own cruelty, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41732865">it was found to have deliberately sold contracts to those who couldn’t afford them</a>.)</p>

 <p>Raylo pushes its rental scheme as a “circular economy,” claiming renting tech is in some way more sustainable and environmentally friendly, <a href="https://internetretailing.net/dyson-and-raylo-set-new-standard-for-circular-tech-as-eu-ramps-up-sustainability-push/">as was declared during its partnership with Dyson last year</a>. Meanwhile, the company has rather embraced its own model <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tech-rental-subscription-service-raylo-clicks-on-30m-fundraising-13499275">by taking on board more than £180 million of debt and equity funding</a> in the last few years, all with a view to launching in the U.S. later this year.</p>

<p>The full game inks onto Switch 2 in April</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, Konami certainly had a heck of a State of Play yesterday, didn't it? We got some big hitting names making their grand return, but also one or two new IPs, one of which we already knew about — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/darwins-paradox">Darwin's Paradox!</a></p>
<p>Co-developed with French studio ZDT Studio, the unusual octopus-starring platformer is coming to Switch 2 and now has a release date of <strong>2nd April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>But that's not the big news here at <em>all</em>, oh no. You can download a free demo on the eShop now and experience one of the game's levels, which is just one big <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> reference.</p>
<p>Yep, a stealthy octopus. Who knew?! And Darwin even gets a Snake-inspired skin in the demo, which will be available in the full game as an Easter Egg.</p>

<p>If this is your first time hearing about Darwin's Paradox, let's fill you in. Inspired by big-budget animated movies, Darwin is an octopus who is suddenly swept away from his ocean home by a beam of light. In his adventure to make it home, Darwin will uncover a conspiracy that could threaten the world, meaning he's the one who may have to save humanity.</p>
<p>Darwin's Paradox blends platforming and puzzle-solving where you'll get to explore creative worlds and meet colourful characters. It's something pretty different from Konami, and we're excited to check out the demo.</p>
<p>The game was originally planned for Switch 1, but the team moved development over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/konamis-octopus-platformer-swims-onto-switch-2-next-year-while-switch-1-version-goes-mia">to focus exclusively on a Switch 2 release</a>. Perhaps the right move given the level of detail we've seen from the trailers so far.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Have you checked out the Darwin's Paradox demo yet? Looking forward to the full release? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

			<p><strong>SEGA</strong> has just released its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/">third-quarter financials</a> for its current fiscal year, and while some of its numbers don't look as strong as the company may have hoped, like having to incur <strong>$200 million</strong> <strong>impairment</strong> by devaluing <strong>Rovio</strong>, the <strong>Angry Birds</strong> maker that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-buys-angry-birds-rovio-to-expand-in-mobile/">acquired back in 2023</a>, its future outlook has a lot for players to look forward to.</p>



<p>In the segment of its presentation regarding its initiatives for the next fiscal year, SEGA lists that it plans "<em>to release four major new titles for mainstay IPs</em>." The next fiscal year will take us all the way to <strong>March 2027</strong>, which means that if SEGA can hit its goal, it will have <strong>four new games</strong> from its <strong>biggest franchises</strong> on shelves for players to grab.</p>



<p>Outside of a new <strong>Sonic</strong> game looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/did-you-like-frontiers-leaker-teases-next-sonic-game-as-community-pleads-for-more-than-just-sonic-on-generic-ue5-terrain/">follow up <strong>Sonic Frontiers</strong></a>, which has not yet been officially announced, the upcoming games we know about from SEGA that don't yet have a release date include: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/">Total War: Medieval III</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">Persona 4 Revival</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There's also the question of the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter Project</a></strong>, the upcoming sequel to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-sequel/">Alien: Isolation</a></strong>, and SEGA's efforts to reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/"><strong>Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, </strong>and <strong>Shinobi</strong></a>. And, of course, we're also still waiting on news for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-6-release-logo/">Persona 6</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Save for a few obvious franchises like Sonic, Persona, and Virtua Fighter, it's unclear what SEGA is referring to when it talks about "<em>mainstay IPs</em>." After having to write down Rovio and seeing a <strong>54.6%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its operating income and a <strong>51.8%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its ordinary income due to recent releases falling short of expectations, SEGA knows it needs its next batch of releases to hit a little higher.</p>



<p>It all comes down to what could be ready and what it believes will be the game to set it on that path to commercial success. If we really do have a flurry of major SEGA games coming from now until March 2027, then we'll hopefully know more about SEGA's plans soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance Next-Gen Update Delivers A ‘Performance Leap With Up to 60FPS, Ultra-Quality Settings’ On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ]]></title>

            <guid>1435498</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although a little <strong>rough around the edges</strong>, the original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> managed to carve out its niche with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most immersive medieval open-world role-playing games ever</strong>, making it easy for many fans of the genre to look past its <strong>technical shortcomings</strong>, especially on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>From today, however, even console players will be able to enjoy the first entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhorse Studios</strong> at its best, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/"><strong>previously rumored</strong></a> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Next-Gen Update</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Announced during today's <strong>Warhorse Studios Anniversary Celebration Stream</strong>, the Next-Gen update allows players to <em>"experience Henry's journey like never before,"</em> delivering a <strong>significant performance boost with up to 60 frames per second, ultra-quality settings, and improved visual assets</strong>. </p>



<p>Though short, the launch trailer below does a good job showing how much the game has been improved for current-generation consoles, and with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">cross-generation save transfers</strong>, returning to 15th-century Bohemia will be easier than ever. All existing owners can also download the update <strong>for free.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>While the high-quality settings and improved assets are welcome, the biggest improvement in the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> Next-Gen Update is the <strong>improved framerate</strong>. Previous generation consoles <strong>struggled to run the game at 30 FPS</strong>, and with massive drops in cities and with some weather conditions, such as rain, it was difficult for most not only to get immersed in the game's setting but also to just enjoy an adventure that still deserved to be played, despite its issues.</p>



<p>All of the issues found in the original have been addressed in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Released last year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, <strong>Henry of Skalitz's second adventure is a memorable one, by all accounts</strong>. "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original,"</em> wrote Chris Wray in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10/10 review.</a></strong></p>

            <p>I wasn’t immediately sure who the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">Steam client beta update</a>, which allows Steam review writers to optionally attach their hardware specs and anonymised framerate data, was for. The reviewers? Not unless they want to inadvertently reveal that the reason they aren’t getting 360fps in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is because they’re trying to run it on a 3DFX Voodoo Banshee. Developers? Performance data could be useful but if I ran a QA department, I’d want that coming from observable tests, not from the bottom of a slur-filled missive from ViperSniper69 (0.2hrs on record).</p>
<p>Then I read the words "This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS," and realised: this is for Valve themselves. A devious ploy to record how thousands of hitherto unbenchmarked games run on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and, eventually, the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Don’t try denying, Gabe and company. The smoking patch note lies further down: "When submitting feedback on whether you agree with a Deck Verified rating, if you disagree we'll now ask for the reason." The Steam Deck Verified programme, huh? Like that of the – and you can’t see, but I’m about to pull back a large ruched curtain – <em><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">Steam Machine Verified programme</a>?</em> You may be gaining access to countless reams of performance and system data, Valve, but I’m the one who knows your game.</p>
<p>This isn’t even the first Steam patch of 2026 to prepare for the upcoming, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">if moderately delayed</a>, Linux gamesbox. Less than a month ago, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/541128612120625572">a huge pile</a> of Steam Input and Big Picture Mode fixes and improvements was unsubtly dumped into the launcher, a brazen show of strength for the Machine’s intended controller support. Analysing game performance? Enabling third-party peripherals as well as the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>? Christ, the depths some people would sink to.</p><p>There are other possibilities here, like helping smaller developers identify tech issues or letting players with similar hardware to a reviewer see how a game might run. Unfortunately, I’ve decided they’re all nonsense, in favour of the Steam Machine thing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Boss Joked To Horizon MMO Maker That It Felt Like Marrying Off His Daughter]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-beta-raids-ncsoft-2000668674</link>
            <guid>1435483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Guild Wars publisher NCSoft revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-ps5-trailer-2000643663"><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em></a> late last year as a new MMO spin-off that would see players group up together on PC and mobile to hunt the sci-fi franchise’s iconic prehistoric robots. Thanks to a new interview with one of the company’s executives, we now have some new details about the upcoming game and a funny anecdote about Guerrilla Games handing off control of <em>Horizon</em> to an outside developer.</p> <p>Speaking with the Korean <a href="https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=311254&amp;sw=%ED%98%B8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%A6%8C%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%8B%B8%20%ED%94%84%EB%A1%A0%ED%8B%B0%EC%96%B4&amp;site=webzine">publication <em>Inven</em></a>, chief business officer Lee Seong-gu shared more information about how the MMORPG will be structured, timing for its first beta test, and insight into NCSoft’s relationship with the PlayStation studio that originally created <em>Horizon</em>. He said Hermen Hulst, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-magic-formula-behind-horizon-zero-dawns-success-1823647530">former Guerrilla Games studio head</a> and current CEO of the PlayStation studio business group, told him that there were two special requests for licensing the <em>Horizon</em> IP.</p>

 <p>“Hermen Hulst, head of SIE, joked that ‘Please do not kill [a] Tallneck (a giraffe-shaped machine),’ and insisted ‘Please take good care of Aloy. It feels like I am sending off my daughter at the aisle,'” Lee Seong-gu told <em>Inven</em>, based on a translation by<em> Kotaku</em>. Aloy seemingly won’t be playable in the game but it’s possible she could still appear in cutscenes.</p> <p>The executive explained that he made several trips to the studio’s Dutch officer to pitch <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and had to prove he was a fan of the franchise. He also said that it was Sony’s idea to reveal the MMO at Gamescom 2025 but he convinced the company to let NCSoft reveal it to a Korean audience first at G-Star 2025 instead.</p>

 <h2>Big raids, no pay-to-win</h2> <p>Lee Seong-gu goes on to confirm that <em>Horizon</em>‘s body-part targeting and destruction will be a core part of the combat in <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> and that players will be able to take part in boss raids with either 16 players or 32. Instead of fixed classes, players will be able to customize their own roles for combat, and there won’t be any auto attacks either. Fights will require manual inputs instead.</p>

 <p>The executive tried to assuage fears that the new game would just be a <em>Horizon</em>-style reskin of NCSoft’s existing MMO series <em>Lineage</em>, and said the monetization will focus on monthly subscriptions, battle passes, and cosmetics rather than pay-to-win mechanics or other gameplay-impacting microtransactions common to mobile games.</p> <p>As for when <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will actually become playable, we still don’t have any firm release date. Lee Seong-gu said the current plan is to let players try it at a demo at Gamescom 2026 with the game’s first beta test following after that, potentially in the first half of 2027. It’s still pretty far off, in other words. Hopefully, Guerrilla’s own upcoming <em>Horizon</em> multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDIGCAIQLhgDMgYIAxAAGAMyBggEEAAYAzIGCAUQABgDMgYIBhBFGD0yBggHEEUYPNIBBzc3NWowajSoAgCwAgE&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em></a>, launches sooner. As we reported last week, a new single-player open-world<em> Horizon</em> sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/hzd3-horizon-sequel-guerrilla-ps6-hunters-gathering-2000666871">isn’t coming anytime soon</a>.</p>

            <p>It's tempting to believe that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> playerbase has been eclipsed by a resurgent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected on one side, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> on the other, but according to Blizzard, that's not the case. Apparently there's still a "massive" playerbase playing Diablo 3, and it counts players in the "millions".</p>
<p>"Each game has its own core players," Diablo Legacy executive producer Matthew Cederquist told me during a group interview at Blizzard recently - Diablo 3 technically falls under the Legacy team's jurisdiction. "There's actually millions of people that still play Diablo 3.</p>
<p>"Even when Diablo 4 came out, some players were cannibalised and brought over to D4, but there's still a massive player base for Diablo 3," he added. "Every single ladder season that comes out, you will see people transition from D4 back to D3 and play for that opening weekend, or that week or so, and they'll transition right back to D4. And vice versa D2."</p>

<p>Cederquist's remark was made when I asked about a comment by previous Diablo boss Rod Fergusson - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7363590883784466434/">who left Blizzard about five months ago to join 2K and lead BioShock</a> - who <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/diablo-iv-">told GameFile</a> in March that, "We have more Diablo 2: Resurrected players than Diablo 3 right now." But that statement only reflects a fleeting state in the series playerbase, Cederquist said. The Diablo audience's playing habits are more fluid when opposed to something like, say, World of Warcraft.</p><p>"That's the cool thing about our community," Cederquist went on to say. "It's less like World of Warcraft: Classic, where that's your home, you don't move; that's mine, I don't go to retail. There's so much inter-cannibalisation." (That's the first time I've heard that phrase.)</p>
<blockquote><em>"It's less like World of Warcraft: Classic where that's your home, you don't move; that's mine, I don't go to retail. There's so much inter-cannibalisation"</em></blockquote>
<p>"The player habits are just different in a long-form progression game," added Tim Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team. He said you spend longer doing things in World of Warcraft - levelling up your character, organising groups and raids. In Diablo games ("except maybe Diablo 1, which is unique in its own right, where I would consider it to be more of a survival horror") it's different.</p>

<p>"There's not the same class-role dynamic saying hey we need a healer, we need a tank and then DPS," Vasconcellos said. "Every class is DPS. Furthermore, the social expectation isn't that we're going to commit to having to play together to progress content.</p><p>"Is it more efficient? Yes. Is it more enjoyable? We think so. You can continue on your own if you want to and the social pressure doesn't exist there, and so people are easily able to flow between one game to the next. That's more feasible in today's modern age where we have so many demands on our time, and the playerbase has also aged and they have more responsibilities to see to. I'm a Diablo dad myself. That's just the reality; I think Diablo suits those players."</p>
<p>It's an interesting take, and a surprising dig at sibling World of Warcraft, but it doesn't answer whether Diablo 2 consistently commands a larger audience than Diablo 3. So I pushed the point again.</p>
<p>"No, no - it's not necessarily like that," responded Cederquist. "Our games fluctuate wildly, and it's because you have those seasonal contents. Everyone comes back for a ladder race, and actually the way we produce them is we separate them for that to happen, so we're never going to have a D3 ladder stepping over a D2 ladder stepping over a D4 ladder. We want players to be able to say, Okay yeah, let me jump into this flavour of Diablo today, maybe this flavour of Diablo two weeks from now and so on."</p>
<p>Whatever the player numbers, I expect there's been a surge in Diablo 2 activity this week, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Diablo 2: Resurrected surprise-released a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock, which introduced a new warlock class</a> to the game - the first new class the game has had in 25 years. The game also launched on Steam and on Game Pass, which I'm sure is bound to drive up numbers. Consider that Cederquist told me in a separate article that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-may-expand-diablo-2-more-if-warlock-class-goes-well">there were already "millions" - and he emphasised the word "millions" - of people playing Diablo 2: Resurrected</a>, and I wonder how high the playerbase will go.</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> is getting an upgrade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, free for existing PS4 and Xbox One owners, and that it’s out today.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance | Next-Gen Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0_5x0wEPDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The current gen upgrade for the original game comes as an anniversary treat for its sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which is celebrating having sold 5 million copies in the past year.</p>
<p>This could be a great way to draw more players into the game because, while Warhorse were keen to make sure that you didn’t&nbsp;<em>need</em> to have played the first to enjoy the story told in the second, there is always that compulsion amongst gamers to start at the very beginning, isn’t there?</p>
<p>Playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance on PS5 and Xbox Series will now mean enjoying the title at 60fps, helping to make the game more responsive on console than before. Additionally, visual fidelity has been enhanced with improved graphical features. This update has been made with assistance from Saber Interactive.</p>

<p>Warhorse CEO, Martin Frývaldský, said, “I’m&nbsp;incredibly proud to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reach this monumental milestone.&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to thank everyone at&nbsp;Warhorse Studios,&nbsp;our publishing partners at&nbsp;PLAION&nbsp;and of course, it&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;be possible without our amazing&nbsp;and ever&nbsp;growing&nbsp;community. Thank you for being&nbsp;part of this journey and making this a reality!”</p>

<p>What immediately jumps out to tech-savvy gamers are the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM requirements</strong>.

<p>The original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, which is among the most complex PS3 games ever released, ran on the measly <strong>256 MB</strong> of the system.

A worthy play for any fan of the series, which has finally returned to the spotlight following its <strong>long absence.</strong></p>

<p>As well as the increased frame rate option, you'll also be able to take advantage of sharper visuals and smoother performance across the board on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, making the current-gen versions of the game the best way to play if you're on console.</p><p>News of <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s appearance on current-gen consoles comes after Warhorse and parent company Embracer announced that sequel <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe50d517-d627-4fd8-90a9-f33dfd15cfc7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has sold five million copies</a> since launching last year.</p><p>The first game is no slouch in the sales department either; it's sold over ten million copies at time of writing, a figure that will no doubt increase further now that more people are able to access it.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it's an action RPG that emphasizes realism and historical accuracy over the usual dragons-and-wizards malarkey (which has its place!). The game is set in 15th-century Bohemia and follows the story of blacksmith's son Henry as he gets embroiled in political intrigue.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's dropping on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today as well.

<p>Just like in the GOG version, you can expect some modernizations and improvements as part of the Steam release of <em>Dino Crisis </em>and <em>Dino Crisis 2</em>, including increased rendering resolution, modern controller support with "optimal button binding", and an improved internal renderer, plus lots more.</p><p><em>Dino Crisis</em>' Steam release rather puts paid to Shinji Mikami's comments about <em>Dino Crisis </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dda2b172-c260-4104-9653-3c47ee717026" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no longer being relevant thanks to <em>Monster Hunter</em></a>; it seems there's room for both to exist in this storied world of ours.</p><p>These re-releases are nice on their own, but it's even more tantalizing to imagine that they might represent a revival for the <em>Dino Crisis </em>franchise as a whole.

Wishful thinking, I know, but let me dream, eh?</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dino Crisis</em>, the first game is a survival horror experience akin to <em>Resident Evil </em>(but with dinosaurs, of course), while the second takes a more action-oriented approach with nods to arcade scoring and other more high-octane mechanics.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first two<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768"><em> Dino Crisis</em></a> games, originally released on the PlayStation 1 over 25 years ago, have finally made their way over to Steam. That’s cool, but uh, wait a minute here, did Capcom include performance-killing DRM on these retro releases? Yes. Yes, it did.</p> <p>On February 12, Capcom announced a fun little surprise for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-new-dino-crisis-merch-event-sequel-remake-horror-2000616659">Dino Crisis</a> f</em>ans. No, it wasn’t a new game or a remake or even a fancy remaster. Instead, Capcom revealed that 1999’s <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its 2000 sequel, <em>Dino Crisis 2,</em> were now available to buy on Valve’s large digital PC gaming store, Steam. As mentioned already, that’s cool. I mean, the games have been available on GOG for a bit and can be easily emulated on fairly weak PCs, but it’s always nice to see publishers bringing older games to more platforms and stores. Except, fans quickly spotted something silly:<em> Dino Crisis 1 </em>and <em>2</em> on Steam include Enigma Protector DRM.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playtime is officially over, kiddies!</p> <p>Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 have finally stomped their way on to Steam. Celebrate this prehistoric occasion by getting both games for 50% off until February 26.</p> <p>🦖 <a href="https://t.co/9uBEJb3tsB">https://t.co/9uBEJb3tsB</a><br>🦖🦖 <a href="https://t.co/dEmqfq19y2">https://t.co/dEmqfq19y2</a> <a href="https://t.co/gWsWh8W1T3">pic.twitter.com/gWsWh8W1T3</a></p> <p>— Capcom USA (@CapcomUSA_) <a href="https://twitter.com/CapcomUSA_/status/2022113977564590098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Capcom, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Dino Crisis</em> Steam forums, you can see plenty of people yelling at Capcom about this incredibly silly and frankly stupid decision. “DRM on a 27-year-old game? Really? What’s wrong with these guys?” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4249130/discussions/0/796709978759016171/">asked one user.</a> Others pointed out that this is the same DRM that Capcom <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182">recently added to its years-old <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake.</a> And that was a disaster, causing all sorts of performance problems for many users on PC.</p> <p>This is made all the more strange by the fact that these<a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-1-2-pc-gog-drm-freelancer-ff7-1851750391"><em> Dino Crisis</em> PC ports seem to be the same versions being sold currently on GOG</a> with zero DRM. For whatever reason, Capcom has decided that the same games available DRM-free on GOG should include crappy DRM that people hate if you buy them on Steam. As you can expect, a lot of people are opting to buy<em> Dino Crisis</em> on GOG until Capcom removes the DRM.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6087ea604cbd1"><a title="Virtual Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6087ea604cbd1/virtual-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, what a lovely surprise! Our local Royal Mail representative knocked on the door today and delivered a curious-looking box, and it turns out that it's none other than the Virtual Boy accessory for Nintendo Switch Online!</p>
<p>Yes, it seems like a whole bunch of people – in the UK, at least – are receiving their retail Virtual Boys early, and so we were lucky enough to get our very own purchased unit.</p>
<p>We've already gone <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/five-takeaways-from-my-time-with-virtual-boy-on-nintendo-switch-online">hands-on with the peripheral and app</a> over at Nintendo of Europe in Frankfurt, so you should definitely check that out if you want a few thoughts on the experience itself.</p><div><figure data-videoid="aHspT9aiKKE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytaHspT9aiKKE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed40228bvuptli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Of course, we've still got a few days to wait until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> app launches (<strong>17th February</strong>), so we can't really get a whole lot of use out of the headset just yet. What we have been able to do, mind you, is see what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s VR mode looks like, and yeah, it's pretty wild stuff.</p>
<p>The main point is that it works – to a degree. Booting up the VR mode in Odyssey lets you view stages just like you could with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> set; just pick up the Virtual Boy and move your head around, job done.</p>
<p>The main issue is that you can't really control Mario at the same time, so unless you're willing to fashion a really big rubber band around your head to keep the headset locked in place, it's not an ideal solution.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out here that Nintendo offered a statement to confirm that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online">Labo VR won't be officially compatible with Virtual Boy</a>, but given these limited tests, we're of the mind that it will at least function to a certain degree. We'll be able to confirm one way or the other when the app itself launches.</p>

<p>As standard, the Virtual Boy comes with a red lens filter, which means that Odyssey had this weird, almost retro-inspired presentation clearly geared toward the upcoming NSO app. It's actually quite cool in practice, but we should note that you can quite easily remove the red lens from the headset, leaving you with a pair of clear lenses that look remarkably similar to Labo's.</p>
<p>With the red filter off, Odyssey looks just like it does when played with Labo, but again, moving your head around while controlling Mario unfortunately isn't really possible with the Virtual Boy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it's, well... a Virtual Boy! I never owned the original, given that it never came out in the UK, so I can't really comment on the feel or heft of the thing, but in terms of presentation at least, it's a dead ringer.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to lift the visor up to slot the Switch 2 inside, and the set also comes with an added bit of plastic to allow your original Switch to fit. Similarly, although removing the red lenses took a little bit of force at first, it was very easy to do once it's been taken out at least once.</p>


<p>We'll have a lot more coverage for you when the Virtual Boy app drops on Nintendo Switch Online next week. For now, we're going to clear a bunch of space off our office desk and display with pride.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metaphorrefantazio-director-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-truly-inspiring-and-conveys-a-deep-understanding-of-jrpgs/</link>
            <guid>1435408</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's a new game bundle on <strong>Steam</strong> that lets you pick up what are arguably two of the best RPGs in the last few years on one discount. Developers <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> and <strong>ATLUS</strong> have joined together to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">form a bundle</a> including both <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> and <strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong>. Both games are currently on sale separately, but you can grab them together in a bundle for <strong>10%</strong> off their combined price, and it's a bundle that both sides are proud to be a part of.</p>



<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio creative director and writer <strong>Katsura Hashino</strong> said that he was "<em>very pleased</em>" to know that Metaphor would be put together with Expedition 33, a game that he had his own personal high level of praise for.</p>



<p>"<em>I am very pleased to hear that a Steam bundle will be released with&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em>, a title that has received high praise around the world," Hashino said in a press release. "<em></em><em>Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is a work that <strong>conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre</strong>, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, <strong>I found it to be truly inspiring</strong>."</p>



<p>"<em>I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches</em>," Hashino continued. "<em>While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, <strong>players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre</strong>. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer</em>."</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated how significant this kind of praise is from such a legend of the JRPG genre. <strong>Persona</strong> fans will know Hashino's work well, as he's been one of ATLUS' key creatives behind <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> and Persona for many years.</p>



<p>For Sandfall Interactive's part, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 creative director and Sandfall's chief executive officer, <strong>Guillaume Broche</strong>, had his own reverie towards ATLUS, Metaphor: ReFantazio and the work that Hashino and his team have accomplished over the years, citing them as inspirations for his love of JRPGs.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;is a game that is really inspiring for us," Broche said. "<em>It tells a beautiful story in a completely new world that is masterfully crafted. It deals with heavy themes but one that resonates strongly with me is the </em><strong><em>importance of imagination in all aspects of our lives</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>"<em>The cast is lovable and the turn-based battle system is one of the best I have played. The re-imagination of the traditional jobs system through Archetypes is fantastic and opens up so many playstyles that are fun to play around with. On top of that, the game has one of the most charismatic villains I've ever seen in an RPG</em>. <em><strong>It is a great honor to be able to collaborate with ATLUS on this bundle</strong>, as I have been a fan of their work since&nbsp;</em><em>Shin Megami Tensei™: Lucifer's Call&nbsp;</em>(also known as&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>&nbsp;for some players)."</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/">Wccftech's staff and community pick for Game of the Year in 2025</a>. We also gave it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong>9.5/10</strong> when we reviewed it at launch</a>, while Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">received a <strong>9/10</strong> from us</a> when we reviewed it in 2024.</p>



<p>Both are two of the best RPGs you can play right now, with this new Steam bundle being a great chance to pick up both if you're a fan of RPGs and JRPGs but have somehow not tried either of them yet.</p>

<p>This is new and therefore special, but this is also old and therefore special is essentially the driving point made by an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/12/legacy-of-kain-ascendance-new-stylistic-direction/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by Legacy of Kain: Ascendance lead writer Claribel Guerra. The game, a 2D action platformer revealed by Crystal Dynamics during last night's PlayStation State of Play, is the first new Legacy of Kain since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Defiance, as it happens, is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-defiance-is-getting-a-proper-remaster-includes-a-demo-of-a-never-before-seen-canceled-game">getting a remaster next month</a>.</p>
<p>In Ascendance, you play as Kain, Raziel, and Elaleth - the former two voiced by returning voice actors Simon Templeman and Michael Bell. The game itself's a weird mishmash. "Ascendance’s 2D side-scrolling presentation and pixel art aesthetic immediately stand out, evoking the era when the series first emerged," Guerra wrote. "That approach is paired with PS1-era-inspired 3D sequences and anime-influenced cinematics, bringing major story moments to life while nodding to the franchise’s first leap into 3D with Soul Reaver. The experience centers on combat and atmosphere, challenging you to master movement, read enemy patterns, and stay in control under pressure."</p><p>While there doesn't look to have been many specifics of the story yet, Guerra insisted that "the world remains bleak and oppressive; the themes are heavy with fate, power, and consequence". "The game’s narrative unfolds across multiple eras, connecting familiar characters and moments from the series’ history while expanding on ideas that were previously only implied," they added.</p>
<p>So, they assert, old heads won't be put off by the upping of pace in terms of actions. You'll still be stopping to figure stuff out and take in key happenings, rather than locked in a constant rush.</p>
<p>Will that actually appeal to clapped-out Soul Reaver enthusiasts like my dear vaycaying colleague? We'll find out when Legacy of Kain: Ascendance comes out on March 31st this year. Or just whenever Edwin's back in. Either way, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4233530/Legacy_of_Kain_Ascendance/">Steam</a>.</p>

I say “reportedly,” because while several threads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1r2r2ou/the_emerging_starsand_island_controversy_what_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit</span></a><span> and the Steam </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2966320/discussions/0/756177397086247029/"><span>discussion board</span></a><span> have discussed said reviews, dozens of these suspicious reviews have since disappeared from </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s </span></i><span>Steam page.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately for the devs, the <em>Starsand Island</em> Steam review rapture ended up bringing even more attention to the game’s strange launch. Yesterday, Seed Spark Lab released a </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772"><span>community update</span></a><span> post on the life sim RPG’s</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Steam page and its official Discord titled “Announcement Regarding Artificial Comments.” It takes aim at the “large number of overly positive ‘praise’ comments about </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span> appearing across various social platforms.”</span></p> <p><span>“Is this some kind of overpraise as an attack? We have no concrete evidence, but it does feel as though someone may be doing this intentionally,” posits Seed Spark Lab. “What makes it even more puzzling is that this approach is not cheap, since leaving a review requires purchasing the game. (We later discovered that some of these accounts refunded the game after posting their reviews.)”</span></p>

 <p><span>They also noted that they believe the majority of these overly positive reviews “appeared to be AI-generated,” and “kindly” requested that whoever is behind the reviews “to stop.” Naturally, regardless of whether Seed Spark Lab’s plea was made in earnest or not, the community post has drawn </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1r2wn61/please_let_us_focus_on_making_our_game_in_peace/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>even more negative attention</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>. There really is no way to prove who is behind the reviews, so there’s little point in pointing fingers, but I have to wonder how anyone would benefit from damaging </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s</span></i><span> reputation by trying to inflate its rating on Steam. Reverse review-bombing with AI bots? What will PC gamers think of next?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Sony State of Play broadcast ended with an announcement and shadow drop for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>, a side-scrolling spin-off listed as having 1-2 player support via the PlayStation Store. The only problem? Fans can't find its two-player option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from those who've paid the game's $29.99 asking price and revisited Kratos' origins say that his sibling Deimos only appears at certain points, there's no two-player option in the game's menus, and plugging in a second PS5 controller doesn't provide extra options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an odd situation that's led some to suspect the PlayStation Store <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> is simply incorrect — as it appears to be the only firm evidence a two-player mode exists — and seek help from others online also searching for its multiplayer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-130432-1770993202798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War Sons of Sparta, listed for 1-2 players. Image credit: PlayStation/IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on reddit and social media, fans say the store's listing didn't initially seem odd — since the game's title is "Sons of Sparta" plural, in-game footage shows the two brothers killing bosses together, and its cover artwork focuses on them fighting side-by-side. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's store description could also be ready ambiguously, referencing the exploits of both brothers: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience an untold chapter in Kratos' journey set during the harsh years of Spartan training alongside his brother Deimos," Sons of Sparta's official blurb reads. "Through endless trials, their minds, bodies, and hearts have been molded to become Spartan soldiers for whom duty and honor mean everything. After a fellow cadet goes missing, Kratos and Deimos vow to find him and embark on an adventure that will put their training and Spartan spirit to the test."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just got it installed and running," wrote God of War fan Mephistocheles on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r38od8/god_of_war_sons_of_sparta_metroidvania_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread with much discussion on the game's lack of co-op play. "So far it's not allowing drop in play on 2nd controller and there were no two-player options on start menu. Will update if I find it does allow co-op, but it doesn't look like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m so sad," wrote bob_th4_build3r. "I bought it instantly because i thought it would be co-op… maybe they will add it in the future?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other comments say they are now escalating the matter to PlayStation's customer support, while several fans say they have tried to request refunds. IGN has contacted PlayStation and Sons of Sparta developer Mega Cat Studios for clarification on the game's two-player capabilities, or lack thereof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's State of Play show also included the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">surprise announcement of a God of War Trilogy Remake</a>, though work on the project at Sony Santa Monica is still in its early stages.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-writer-hopes-zaum-never-becomes-a-aaa-studio</link>
            <guid>1435393</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer ZA/UM may have had a significant hit with 2019’s Disco Elysium, but it remains a reasonably small studio. And, at least as far as writer and VO director Jim Ashilevi is concerned, that’s how things should remain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio,” he said during a recent interview with IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM currently employs just under 100 members of staff, many of whom work remotely from different places across the world. Its has offices in Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; and Porto, Portugal, and the company remains independently owned. While this is admittedly a bigger outfit than many indie developers enjoy, it’s still small-scale. And that’s how Ashilevi likes it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we're always deeply encouraged and inspired by the indie scene because that's where the fresh ideas come from,” he said. “The avant-garde stuff always happens on the fringes, and I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio. Honestly, even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities and values as artists and storytellers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of that conversation, Ashilevi offered his assessment of the gaming landscape. “I think it's grim out there,” he said. “I think the industry is in a really rough place. We all know that. But I don't think the industry is in a rough place creatively. I think, in a way, it's better than ever. It's better than ever before because anyone can make a game that touches the hearts of hundreds of millions of people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comment came in reference to the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which, while developed on a much higher budget than any of ZA/UM’s projects, was 2025’s demonstration that there’s an enormous appetite for single-player, story-led games produced outside of the mega-publishers’ circles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the industry has become less gatekeep-y in a way,” he said. “But that also presents another problem, which is how do you even begin to promote your game, or make sure that it actually finds its audience? I think really the only thing you can control is whether you're staying true to your own vision and your own voice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explored earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor"><u>that vision has been ZA/UM’s “North Star” when it comes to Zero Parades</u></a>. “For that reason, I'm already really proud and happy with what we've done,” says Ashilevi. “It's like the response coming from the players – which will hopefully be positive, mostly positive – is almost just a bonus at this point. The real value I got out of it as a storyteller was just getting to know my friends and colleagues a little better and getting to know more about what goes on in their hearts and minds and souls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from ZA/UM, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-and-disco-elysium-developer-zaum-on-ai-we-dont-use-it">the studio’s stance on using AI</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaums-new-rpg-is-similar-to-disco-elysium-because-were-still-the-same-people">why its new RPG resembles Disco Elysium so closely</a>.
