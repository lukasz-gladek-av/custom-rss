			<p><a href="https://kalshi.com/">Kalshi</a>, the US prediction market and market trading platform where millions of people bet on major global and cultural events, including things like <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards">what the game of the year will be this year at The Game Awards 2025</a> has crossed a cultural milestone by appearing in an ad for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The ad is a live-action mock-up of fictional news cycles that follow the events of the narrative in Black Ops 7, and at about halfway through the short teaser trailer, a shot of a Kalshi query regarding whether robots will replace human soldiers in the US military is spotted with 76% of fictional bets voting yes, and the remaining 24% saying no.</p>



<p>Kalshi shared the trailer from its official account on X (formerly Twitter), writing, "<em>Kalshi *hands shake emoji* Call of Duty. Prediction markets and culture are now one.</em>"</p>



<p>There are several claims online that Kalshi has partnered with Activision in some way, but there's no official word from either company that the partnership is any deeper than Kalshi appearing in the trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That said, the prediction market's appearance alone is of some significance, as it's another layer of cultural integration for the platform that hasn't yet been seen, especially at such a high scale as this.</p>



<p>We'll provide an update if it becomes clear that there is a deeper partnership here. In the meantime, you can expect to see more of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this coming week, starting on Tuesday, August 19, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/760049/steam-first-five-purchases-meme-dragon-age</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-my-first-five-steam-purchases-say-about-me.1271403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a meme currently going around Bluesky where people are posting their first purchases on Steam. Taking a look presents a neat time capsule, offering a glimpse of who we used to be. It also gives us a chance to compare our gaming habits now with what they were 10 or more years ago — that is, if you’re one of the Olds that’s been around that long. On a lark, I looked at mine and got the thrill of being able to place a date on when exactly my current life began.</p><p>Sometimes, examining your earliest Steam purchases presents as many questions as answers. My very first Steam purchases were made on December 25th, 2010, and were all over the place in genre: <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, the <em>Left 4 Dead </em>bundle, and<em> Team Fortress 2</em>. I played and enjoyed many hours of both <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and <em>Amnesia</em>, but to this very day, I have never stepped foot inside a <em>TF2</em> lobby.</p><p><em>TF2</em> was not my kind of game. Hero shooters wouldn’t be a Thing for me until <em>Overwatch</em> blew down the doors of my anti-multiplayer shooter bunker and even then, it’s only <em>Overwatch</em>. Not to mention that the stories of <em>TF2</em> voice chat toxicity were the stuff of 4chan legend. My Black, female ass in a voice chat multiplayer lobby in <em>2010</em>? Absolutely not!</p><p>This list has kickstarted memories that I haven’t reached for in decades, but I don’t think I’ll ever understand why I bought <em>TF2</em>.</p><p>My next set of purchases came a few months later in January and February 2011: <em>DC Universe Online</em> and <em>Rift</em>. Why I bought these MMOs makes far more sense to me than my forever mysterious purchase of <em>TF2</em>. Before getting my Steam account, the only computer games I had ever played were MMOs and the<em> Rise of Rome </em>expansion from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578144/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-xbox-controller"><em>Age of Empires II</em></a><em>. </em>(If you want to know how the Roman Empire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/09/21/tiktoks-roman-empire-meme-explained/">became my Roman Empire</a>, look no further.)</p><p>I was a big <em>World of Warcraft</em> player, but by that time, I had grown bored with it. 2011 would have been right between the <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansions, neither of which I particularly liked. I didn’t really jive with <em>DC Universe Online</em> either, but I played it because, of all things, a boy. My boyfriend at the time was super into the MMO, in which you cosplay as heroes who take over when Wonder Woman and Batman are indisposed. Both my subscription and the relationship lasted longer than they should have.</p><p>I remember the buzz surrounding <em>Rift</em>, a new-at-the-time MMO that was supposed to be the “<em>WoW</em> killer” — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft/483876/the-wow-killers-that-werent/">unaware that such claims had been made about many other MMOs at the time</a>. I remember very little about <em>Rift</em>, which is probably why my <em>WoW</em> subscription is more than 20 years old at this point.</p><p>The fact that <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is on this list at all is another mystery. Before it, I had never played any BioWare games nor any narrative PC games. I don’t remember who suggested it to me — maybe my boyfriend, maybe a friend at college. But the presence of this game on this list gives me an exact date for when my life changed as a gamer and a person: Saturday, March 19, 2011.</p><p><em>Origins</em> isn’t my favorite in the series. In fact, it’s the one <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-returning-to-dragon-1844909473">I dread the most trying to replay</a>. (I am mad as <em>hell</em> at the revelation from <em>Dragon Age</em> producer Mark Darrah that EA <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ea-reportedly-turned-down-pitch-for-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-tragic/">refused to fund a remaster of the series</a>.) But it’s the one that introduced me to narrative, choice-focused, and companion-romancing RPGs. It introduced me to my first BioWare romance Alistair Theirin, and as in all things regarding love, you never forget your first.</p><p>Knowing when I bought this game puts me back in a place that I haven’t thought of in literal decades. I played<em> Origins</em> on a tiny desktop computer tucked into the corner of my too-small living room. That was my first apartment with my boyfriend, and I felt grown for the first time, even though I was well into my early 20s. But even though I was cohabitating with a real man, I was obsessed with the pixelated one in my computer. So obsessed that I taught myself to mod just to add more, shall we say, “<em>narrative</em>” scenes between my Warden character and Alistair. There’s even a funny bit of environmental storytelling with this list. After <em>Origins</em>, I didn’t make another Steam purchase for more than a year. The game took over my life.</p><p>The rest is history. My introduction to the <em>Dragon Age</em> series brought me into the <em>Dragon Age</em> fandom. Through it, I would meet my best and longest friends, rediscover my love of writing, and with that instigating spark, start the journey that would lead me to becoming a game journalist — the second-best decision I’ve made in my life. (The first being finally letting go of that previous relationship.)</p><p>I really appreciate that Steam has kept such a thorough accounting of my early activities on the platform because it’s put a date on the origin of the person that I am today. Go look at yours and see how much you’ve changed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760049/steam-first-five-purchases-meme-dragon-age]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It is often said there is no ethical consumption under capitalism but come dream with me of a better world. A world where we could buy something that makes ourselves and society better for having undertaken the transaction, a world where the act of consumption <em>creates </em>riches and resources. A world where I buy a 98-inch television.</p><p>I can see you are puzzled and dare I say even a bit offended? You are perhaps stuck on the apparent contradictions of this stance. Don’t worry, I am not judging you. I merely ask that you grant my ideas a fair hearing before you decide that me possessing a 98-inch TV is contrary to our shared egalitarian values and commitment to leaving a better world than we were given.</p><p>First, let me be very clear about something: I am sensitive to the offensive price of a 98-inch OLED TV and under no circumstances would I buy such a thing unless we made the kind of progress as a society that granted me the $25,000 required to purchase such a thing. It is in the spirit of shared sacrifice that I am proposing to forego the infinite contrast ratios, perfect blacks, and incredible image accuracy that OLED TVs offer in favor of a more democratic or rustic LED panel. Likely produced by a Chinese company in Vietnam by our revolutionary comrades under what I am confident are excellent conditions and offered at a price that is accessible to all, from the highest to the lowest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>When I played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i></a><span>, Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game and surprise dark horse in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357"><span>2024 Game of the Year race</span></a><span>, I couldn’t have anticipated it would reach the level of fandom in which it got cute, </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing?utm_campaign=mouthwashing-launch&amp;utm_source=twitter-steam-discord"><span>marketable plushies</span></a><span>. Its subject matter is very dark, but then again, that’s never really stopped horror games and movies from going down this path. I suppose it shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that its characters are getting stuffed toys, despite the terrible things they all go through in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s brief runtime. What is surprising is that after all this time, the community is not only still debating the game’s horrors and morality…but now, they’ve devolved into going for each other’s throats over a plush of a character named Jimmy reimagined as a cute cat.</span></p> <p><b>Content warning: Sexual assault</b></p>  <p><span>Jimmy is the primary player character in </span><i>Mouthwashing</i><span>. He and his crew have been stranded in space after their freight ship collided with an asteroid, and the game goes over the fallout of the crash and the months that followed. Without getting too into everything that goes down, suffice it to say </span><i>Mouthwashing </i><span>is a pretty harrowing story involving some of the worst things humans are capable of, and Jimmy is the perpetrator of a lot of those crimes. He’s also an unreliable narrator attempting to cover up what he’s done, and the things he’s revealed to have done on the ship put him far beyond any possible redemption.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy does a lot of reprehensible things in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, and the one that’s perhaps most notable is that the game implies he raped Anya, the lone woman on the ship, who is now pregnant. We don’t need to get into all the repercussions of this act here, but as you can imagine, a lot of </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans are not fans of Jimmy’s. In fact, I’d argue the game’s entire point is to make you hate this guy. He’s the villain of this story, and even if he attempts to do the right thing at the end of the game, that’s not going to be enough for some. Others, meanwhile, do find him compelling as a character whose layered story has a lot of depth. For some who find his actions unforgivable, even believing him an interesting centerpiece in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s story goes beyond what they believe to be morally acceptable.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fast forward to August 2025, and a collectible manufacturer called </span><a href="https://www.plushshop.com/"><span>Plushshop</span></a><span> is making a cat-shaped plush of Jimmy. The store has stuffed cats based on characters from anime, TV shows, and video games, ranging from </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>One Piece</span></i><span>. When the company first announced plans to make </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes, those plans didn’t include one for Jimmy, which led to backlash from fans. The company has since removed those initial </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes from its store and deleted any mention of them from its social media accounts. </span></p> <p><span>However, after the shop announced its Jimmy plush as a separate launch, </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans jumped on the website to leave negative user reviews saying that given Jimmy’s true nature, he shouldn’t be made into a cute cat plush. That alone is maybe a conversation worth having, but the comments quickly devolved into a toxic cesspool, with some people claiming that those who bought the plush were rape apologists and several comments that, for some reason, included racial slurs. I went to go look at them myself on PlusShop’s website, but the Jimmy plush seems to have been removed. We’ve reached out to PlushShop for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, screenshots of the reviews have begun circulating on places like </span><a href="https://x.com/SecondHorn31331/status/1955290233789956236"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mouthwashing/comments/1mper2l/the_jimmy_meow_plush_from_plush_shop/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>, but do be warned that there’s some foul language in those links.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As someone who really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>for its exploration of the human psyche and its striking visuals, am I thrilled that its characters are being made into plushes? Not particularly. I do think it’s a bit weird to make those characters cute cats or even just regular toys. It turns a pretty horrific story into an almost absurdist display prop, and even the officially </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing/products/curly-mouthwashing-plush"><span>licensed plush of a man</span></a><span> wrapped up in bandages with his painkillers made into an accessory kind of feels like a parody or shitpost, turning some of the most memorable, horrific imagery in the game into a purchasable gag. All that said, the reaction to this cat plush is so ludicrously overblown and reeks of the kind of “putting fictional characters on trial” nonsense that has plagued discussions around games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>and that I can’t believe we’re still dealing with in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Good stories are built around conflict, and in some of those stories, the perpetrators of that conflict are reprehensible people who cannot be redeemed in the eyes of the beholder. Yes, in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, one character has committed one of the most vile things a person is capable of. But he is not a real person, and he is not on trial. Liking a story in which people do terrible things is not the same as endorsing their actions, and if that goes over someone’s head, I’m surprised they’re engaging with </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>to begin with considering several of its characters are morally dubious, to say the least. Since some of the comments weighing in on this use racial slurs, I imagine at least some of those people putting Jimmy on trial have larger issues than a lack of media literacy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The root of these kinds of arguments is that there will always be people who don’t understand that others engage with art differently than they do. One thing I’ve learned in my years of writing, reading, watching, and listening to criticism is that you’ll find that there are some people who have different expectations when they voice an opinion about a work. For example, when someone lashes out at a critique, it’s often under the pretense that a critic is trying to “change” something they think is fine. When some fans voice a complaint about a game, they expect the developers to address it in a patch, and so when they see another person criticizing anything, this is the only framework they have for understanding that critique: as, effectively, a complaint to management over an issue they wish to see rectified. </span></p>

 <p><span>The same thing happens with how people engage with characters. Some people only “like” characters if they support everything they do and can stand by them in the end, so the concept of enjoying a character who does reprehensible shit is so foreign to them that it is somehow a moral failing to derive any sort of satisfaction from them, even from dissecting their actions. Because people are so fixated on their own media literacy framework, art that engages in uncomfortable topics will never be free from Tumblr-era moralizing. To people who make these arguments, “problematic” storylines are just problems to be solved, rather than a means of exploring potentially challenging or uncomfortable themes. The curtains were blue. Jimmy was a bad guy. That’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span>I didn’t expect to rant about this on a random Friday in August, and I certainly didn’t expect it to be over a toy cat. I really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, but I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t get too involved with its community, because it sure seems like there are a lot of people in that community who are ill-equipped to engage with the game they’re purportedly fans of.</span></p>

<p>The Mini SSD card isn't and may never be a formally ratified standard, but it does aim to solve a real problem for portable gaming systems—the need for fast storage that can load games at speeds approaching those of an internal SSD, without requiring users to take their own systems apart to perform upgrades.</p>
<h2>Why are games getting so dang big, anyway?</h2>

      Big storage, small size.

<p>A <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2680-game-install-sizes/">2023 analysis from TechSpot</a> suggested that game size had increased at an average rate of roughly 6.3GB per year between 2012 and 2023—games that come in over 100GB aren't the norm, but they aren't hard to find. Some of that increase comes from improved graphics and the higher-resolution textures needed to make games look good on 4K monitors and TVs. But TechSpot also noted that the storage requirements for narrative-heavy, cinematic-heavy games like <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> were being driven just as much by audio files and support for multiple languages.</p>
<p>"In total, nearly 17 GB of storage is needed for [<em>The Last of Us</em>] data unrelated to graphics," wrote author Nick Evanson. "That's larger than any entire game from our 2010 sample! This pattern was consistent across nearly all the 'Godzilla-sized' games we examined—those featuring numerous cinematics, extensive speech, and considerable localization were typically much larger than the rest of the sample in a given year."</p>
<p>For another prominent recent example, consider the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/cyberpunk-2077s-mac-port-will-run-on-all-apple-silicon-chips-even-the-aging-m1/">install sizes for the Mac version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>. The version of the game on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG runs about 92GB. However, the version available for download from Apple's App Store is a whopping 159GB, solely because it includes all of the game's voiceovers in all of the languages it supports. (This is because of App Store rules that require apps to have all possible files included when they're submitted for review.)</p>
<p>It's clear that there's a need for fast storage upgrades that don't require you to disassemble your console or PC completely. Whether it's this new "mini SSD," a faster iteration of microSD Express, or some other as-yet-unknown storage format remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer Hero Games, an early investor in Game Science's Black Myth Wukong, announced its own game, CrisisX. It's a post-apocalyptic open world survival crafting game in development for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512880/CrisisX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile devices (Android, iOS) with a launch window estimated in Q2 2026.</p>



<p>In CrisisX, players will explore a massive 1,200-km² open world with up to 5K other players on a single server. This big map features 12 distinct terrains, ranging from Western-style towns and hidden laboratories to snowy mountaintops. Each terrain is filled with unique items, vegetation, resources, and wild animals to discover, collect, and hunt.</p>



<p>According to Hero Games, CrisisX boasts a versatile combat system that offers an array of weapons, including machetes, crossbows, pistols, sniper rifles, machine guns, RPGs, and grenades. They'll need them, too, as the ruined game world is populated by dangerous zombie-like Infected NPCs, including hordes and 'Titan mutants'. Players can even build armored vehicles like M2 Bradleys or WWII-era M4 Sherman tanks to fight over vital resources like oil wells.</p>



<p>To better resist in this harsh world, players may join forces in teams, groups, and communes to seize strategic resource points and expand their territories. While unity offers a better chance of survival against the Infected Hordes and brutal elements, it also inevitably leads to bigger, more bitter turf wars between rival groups. Beyond combat, as befitting a survival game, players must manage their characters' hunger, thirst, and health; every physical activity impacts their strength and attributes.</p>



<p>CrisisX also includes home-building features that players can use to claim territory on the open world multiplayer map and then expand into a bigger, badder homestead with fences, farms, livestock, and more that can repel the Infected. But it isn't just NPCs you need to worry about, as other survivors can raid your home at any time.</p>

Still, much of the species' full appearance remains a mystery, as only a partial skull and teeth have so far been found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body," Fitzgerald continued. Adorable!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Janjucetus dullardi has been placed as a member of the rare mammalodontids group of ancient whales that existed 34-23 million years ago, which later evolved into the humpbacks and minke whales of today. Or in Pokémon terms, it would have definitely been Water-type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The species has been named after amateur fossil hunter and high school principal Ross Dullard, who contacted Museums Victoria after unearthing the skull on a local beach. Confirming it did indeed belong to a previously-unknown species has since taken six years of research — a lot longer than simply registering it to a Pokédex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, however, has finally brought that confirmation — something Dullard says has given him "the greatest 24 hours of my life" and "high fives coming left, right and center" when he was greeted on his high school campus the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's taken my concentration for six years," Dullard said. "I've had sleepless nights. I've dreamt about this whale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, how about returning it to life, Helix Fossil style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-last-of-us-multiplayer/">The Last of Us Online</a> was a project that many fans of the series were excited about, since there are still people who, to this day, play the Factions multiplayer mode that launched with the original game in 2013. But Naughty Dog decided it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/">didn't want to be a multiplayer-focused studio, and ended up cancelling the project</a> after years of development work, to the disappointment of fans, and the developers at Naughty Dog who worked on the project and saw its potential.</p>



<p>Including the former game director on the project at Naughty Dog, Vinit Agarwal, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">Game*Spark</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/">VGC</a>), spoke about how one of the reasons he left after a decade with the studio was that he saw "<em>the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer," </em>after his time working on The Last of Us Online and every other project he was on at Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>"<em>My main titles were Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 2</em>. <em>I worked on both multiplayer and single-player.</em> <em>I was mainly in charge of boss battles, and Naughty Dog’s boss battles are generally one-on-one situations. So I wanted players to feel like they were fighting a human player, not an AI, even in single-player. To be more specific, I worked on the final boss in A Thief’s End and the fight between Ellie and Abby in The Last of Us Part II. I used all my knowledge of multiplayer to create the feeling that you were fighting a human. A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer.</em>"</p>



<p>Agarwal has set up a new international studio between the United States and Japan with another Naughty Dog alumnus, writer and former creative director Joe Pettinati, who will be running the US office, while Agarwal will be based in Japan. The official name of the studio has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>This new title, which Agarwal described as "<em>triple-indie</em>," is still early in its development, only being a few months along at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>There’s not much we can say yet, but the new game is a multiplayer game, and we aim to bring the cinematic action we’ve been familiar with from our previous titles to multiplayer</em>," said Agarwal. "<em>We’re already in contact with partners, and we expect to have more information to share in the future</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever Agarwal and Pettinati are working on, it won't look like The Last of Us Online, and it certainly won't feature anything copyrighted by Sony, but it could potentially be the multiplayer game that Factions fans were hoping to play before the official project was shut down. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taco-bell-baja-midnight-review-blast-mtn-dew-2000618026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/taco-bell%E2%80%99s-first-new-baja-blast-flavor-in-21-years-is-a-subtle-symphony-of-artificial-flavoring.1271322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>“Baja Blast has consistently sparked creativity, defied expectations, and continues to be a cornerstone of the Taco Bell experience,” said Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, in a press release announcing Baja Midnight. Okay, calm down, Taylor. But yeah, I’ll grant you that people like Baja Blast and your newly released passionfruit-infused variation of the soda is pretty dang good.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tacobell.com/newsroom/mountain-dew-baja-midnight">While that press release</a> quote is filled with buzzwords and exaggerations, it is indeed true that the blue tropical spin on Mountain Dew known as Baja Blast has been a part of Taco Bell’s menu for 20 years and is a certified fan favorite that keeps people coming back to the Tex-Mex fast food chain. Given its popularity, it almost feels dangerous for Taco Bell to tinker with that beloved drink. Rarely do things go well when you start messing around with something as old and beloved as Baja Blast. But I’m glad someone did because Mountain Dew Baja Midnight, a new soda that will be available exclusively at Taco Bell, is a tasty spin on one of my favorite sodas. And hey, if you hate it, Baja Blast is still being sold at Taco Bell, too.</p> <p>I visited my local Taco Bell on August 14, the day Baja Midnight was released. Pulling up to the drive-thru thru I was greeted by large signs announcing the arrival of Baja Midnight. The signs were all purple and showed off the new soda, which is also purple. In the press release for the drink, Montgomery called it “Taco Bell purple.” Sure, why not?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618034">©Taco Bell</figcaption></figure> <p>We pulled up to the drive-thru, I checked in with my app (Yeah, I’m a real Taco Bell sicko) and ordered some food and two big cups of Midnight. They were very purple, as purple and vibrant as the posters and PR images promise. I thought to myself, “Should a human being consume something so unnaturally colored and vibrant?” and then remembered I’ve been drinking energy drinks and eating at Taco Bell for decades now. If that hasn’t killed me, a weirdly purple soda won’t do it.</p> <p>I took my first big sip of Midnight after eating some Taco Bell goodness, and at first, I thought I was just drinking Baja Blast. The new soda is just as sweet and tropical-y as the OG version. Was this some strange prank Taco Bell execs were playing on customers? But a moment later, my taste buds detected the passionfruit flavor. It wasn’t very strong, and I imagine folks who love passionfruit will be disappointed by how subtle it is. For me, it worked quite well. Baja Blast is a perfect soda to pair with Taco Bell’s burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. I was worried that Midnight would ruin that combo. Instead, the subtle passionfruit just offers a new way to experience Baja Blast.</p> <p>In the future, I’ll still continue to order Baja Blast, but I expect that on some trips to Taco Bell, I’ll want to shake things up and Baja Midnight will be there waiting for me, offering up an ever-so-slightly tartier and sweeter spin on the OG drink. So good job, Taylor Montgomery, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell, and everyone else involved. You didn’t ruin Baja Blast and made some nice. Congrats. Now add chips to the Cantina Chicken Bowl, please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged Games has a new set of Epic Encounters boxes for pre-order. The new <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets provide a prebuilt, ready-to-play <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> encounter themed around steel constructs and clockwork automata for sci-fi inclined DMs.</p>

<h2>The <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> Set Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://steamforged.com/products/epic-encounters-sanctuary-of-the-steelborn" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> set comprises two boxes. The first, <em>Epic Encounters: Sanctuary of the Steelborn</em>, is the minion encounter box. It contains 20 miniatures, an encounter booklet, and a double-sided encounter map designed for thematic, dynamic battles.</p>

It contains a single large boss miniature with a 120 mm base. An encounter booklet providing boss behaviors and abilities, several difficulty tiers, a set of tokens to represent minions, and a double-sided battle map as well.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Steelborn to <em>Epic Encounters</em> may be contentious on the surface. The central idea of Steamforged's product line is to provide challenging, exciting, fantasy battles based around iconic monster archetypes. Their line has ranged from undead skeletons to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bandits</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-island-of-crab-archon-and-cove-of-dragon-turtle-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crab monsters</a>, to dragons, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drow and driders</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance, the <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets appear to be at odds with high fantasy. But, for more seasoned members of the community, their inclusion is natural. Metal golems have been staples in various fantasy settings like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Elder Scrolls</em></a>. Critical Role's Exandria setting features sophisticated automata. An entire <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> setting, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-eberron-forge-of-artificer-delayed-due-to-production-issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a>, is built around magic artificers and warforged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Epic Encounters</em> is but one product line in Steamforged Games' catalog.

<p>If you’re pining for the days when games like <i>F-Zero</i> and <i>WipEout</i> offered up blistering fast races, then Nintendo Switch 2 launch title <i>Mario Kart World</i> might feel a little slow for you. Worry not, speed demon, as there’s another racer in the launch lineup that might just tickle your fancy. Enter: <i>Fast Fusion</i>.</p> <p>The fourth title in the Fast franchise, <i>Fast Fusion</i> takes everything that has worked well for the series over the past few generations and pumps it up to 4k / 60 fps to provide one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s most attractive and heart-pounding gameplay experiences. Here’s how long it’ll take you to experience this face-melting thrill ride in its entirety, what machines are best, and more.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-tracks-are-in-fast-fusion"></span>How many tracks are in <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>At launch, <i>Fast Fusion</i> offered 12 different tracks, with half of them originally from 2015’s Wii U title <i>Fast Racing Neo</i>. In late June of this year, developer Shin’en Multimedia released the first of its promised free updates that added an additional six tracks. The update also added a new rendering option and new music.</p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-some-of-the-best-machines/vehicles-in-the-game"></span>What are some of the best machines/vehicles in the game?<span></span></h2> <p>Of the 15 vehicles, or “machines” as the game refers to them, Kamagori, Spaarc, Guang Zhou, Mueller, Cebra, Mech Guyva, and Rochdale &amp; Ziro are all excellent choices. That said, if you’re just starting out, the Cebra is a good way to get a feel for the game.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-people-can-play-at-once"></span>How many people can play at once?<span></span></h2>  <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> supports up to eight players when playing online, and four people can play via split-screen locally on the same Switch 2.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-fast-fusion"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Fast Fusion</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> demands that you become adept at rapidly dodging obstacles, alternating between color modes to match on-track speed boosts, and managing your own personal boost meter. Races in <i>Fast Fusion</i> are extraordinarily fast, and a mere one or two mistakes can cost you the whole race.</p>

 <p>Success and completion in <i>Fast Fusion</i> will come down to how well you can master these intriguing mechanics and overcome its Championship mode. There are multiple cups to beat on your way to finishing this mode, but you can’t just eek your way through them with placement.</p> <p>Instead,<i> Fast Fusion</i> requires you to purchase the Championship mode cups using currency you earn from racing. Since this currency is also used to purchase new vehicles, you’ll probably need to repeat some cups a few times to have enough to unlock everything you need to overcome future cups.</p>

 <p>When you mix <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s challenging gameplay with a reliance on currency over placement, you get a game with a playtime that is hard to nail down. But if you’re skipping new vehicle purchases and focusing solely on unlocking and finishing cups, <b>you can probably see the end of the Championship mode in 2-3 hours</b>.</p> <p>There’s more to do after you complete Championship mode, however. You can check out Time Attack mode to see how quickly you can clear tracks, or dive into Super Hero mode for a significantly more challenging racing experience. And though <i>Fast Fusion</i>‘s multiplayer functionality leaves a bit to be desired thanks to lack of matchmaking, it can still be a fun diversion with friends.</p> <p>All-in-all, <i>Fast Fusion</i> is a fast, frenetic racing title that offers Nintendo Switch 2 owners something truly nerve-rattling (in a good way) to play on their new hardware. For only $14.99, you could make considerably worse decisions while perusing the eShop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Fast Fusion</i> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo has recently updated its detachable dual-screen patent. </p>



<p>Nintendo and patents are two words that we have been listening to together constantly for the past couple of months, however, not for the reasons you would expect. The patents in question relate to the Palworld lawsuit, with Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-modifies-patent-amid-ongoing-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modifying one</a> of them. However, the new update is for a hardware tech, rather than a game. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-nintendo-going-to-announce-a-detachable-second-screen-for-the-switch-2">Is Nintendo Going to Announce a Detachable Second Screen for the Switch 2? </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/548389/article/nintendo-updated-their-detachable-dual-screen-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, Mike Odyssey on <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1956093315931365493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) informed players about the update on Nintendo’s detachable dual-screen patent. Their post reveals that the update was released yesterday, August 14, 2025, accompanied by new images. These images illustrate how the detachable screen connects to the primary device and also showcase the spring mechanism and various buttons that will be used on the device. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YES!! I knew it! NEW UPDATED PATENT! Nintendo Switch 2 Second Screen! Check out the updated images! (Credit is appreciated!) Srouce: USPTO <a href="https://t.co/fkYUUyWVVz">pic.twitter.com/fkYUUyWVVz</a></p>— Mike Odyssey (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1956093315931365493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>For those wondering, the patent regarding Nintendo’s detachable second screen was seen first in 2023. At that time, many players speculated that Nintendo could be returning to its roots with the Switch 2, introducing a DS-like second screen that could be detached when not in use. However, the Switch 2 has now been released, and we have yet to see any announcements for this detachable screen. </p>



<p>In other news, a new claim states that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-wont-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be available</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-lookalike-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld lookalike</a> has been spotted on Nintendo’s store.

The developer had also announced the winding down of operations.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Dragon Age fans have also taken to Wplace to protest EA (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-remastered-trilogy-cancelled-by-ea-fans-angry-messages-on-wplace/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>) following reports that that proposals for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/">remaster of the Dragon Age Trilogy had been rejected</a> by the publisher.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 10 will introduce a new, more powerful type of Unique item called Chaos Armor that will take an existing Unique and convert it into a different armor slot, opening up even more build possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed the new item type in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> ahead of Diablo 4 Season 10's upcoming PTR playtest, where it also dove into details on how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-diablo-4-season-10-ptr-is-shaking-up-infernal-hordes/1100-6533978/" data-ref-id="1100-6533978">shaking up its Infernal Hordes</a> endgame activity.</p><p dir="ltr">A Chaos Armor Unique item will always appear at maximum power and have at least one greater affix, often making them stronger than the normal version of that Unique. But the fact that they are stronger isn't the biggest change. Normally, Uniques are just that: unique. Each Unique has only ever been available for one armor slot. If you found a Fists of Fate, that item is specifically for the glove slot. If you found a Razorplate, that is specifically a piece of chest armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267"></a><figcaption>An example of a Chaos Armor version of the Banished Lord's Talisman Unique.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not the case with Chaos Armor, which takes an existing Unique item and makes it so it has a chance to appear as an item for another gear slot. Instead of a chestpiece, a Chaos Armor Razorplate could be a helm, for example, or Fists of Fate could be a pair of boots instead. The change opens up new builds for Diablo 4's classes in a huge way, allowing players to create new combinations of Unique items that weren't previously possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There are really only two downsides to Chaos Armor. One is that you can't equip a Chaos Armor version of a Unique and the original Unique at the same time (which you probably wouldn't want to do anyways), and the second is that there won't be Chaos Armor versions for an item's originally intended gear slot. Once again using Razorplate as an example, that means if your thorn build currently uses Razorplate in the chest slot, you won't be able to snag a Chaos Armor Razorplate for that same slot to serve as a slightly better version of what you were already using. Instead, you'll have to get creative and come up with some new item options for whatever slot that Unique previously occupied.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, finding new Uniques will be even easier in Season 10 as well, as Blizzard also outlined how it's improving loot drops. Unique items will have a higher chance to drop across all difficulties, and Magic and Rare items will no longer appear as rewards from Whispers or quests when playing on Torment difficulty. Helltide reward quality will also be increased, meaning increased chances of being able to gain Uniques from the event's caches.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 10 is slated to begin September 23, but it doesn't appear to bring many of the major changes that both Blizzard and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators have recently teased</a>. Meanwhile, Diablo 4's second expansion won't be coming until 2026, though a recent leak suggests it could finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">add Paladin as a playable class</a>.</p>

            <p>When you think of skateboarding games, what is the first thing you think of? For me, it's the music - whether it was being introduced to the impeccable drum work of Josh Freese in The Vandals' Euro-Barge on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tonyhawk-n-gage">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater </a>1, trying to get my voice as high as 3 Inches of Blood's singer in Deadly Sinners in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-thug2-ps2">Tony Hawk's Underground 2</a>, or learning how to play Jack White's part in Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine after hearing it in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-review">Skate</a>, music is an integral part of these games.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">THPS 1+2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">3+4</a> remasters understand this, and bring a nice mix of classic and modern music to the re-releases that (I think) represents what skate culture should always be about: honouring legacy and trying new stuff. EA's upcoming Skate reboot seems to have got this brief, too, as today the publisher has announced that the game will have "over 100 songs" featured on the in-game soundtrack.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Back to the grind. | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pleasantly, these will vary from the likes of upcoming acts like Denzel Curry and Turnstile - yes, I know they're four albums in, but they're also only just breaking through to the mainstream - and more classic acts like MF Doom and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.</p><p>"[Skate will have] over 100 songs, with hits from emerging artists and deep cuts to help players discover new music as they skate through San Vansterdam," reads a press release. "Each session stays fresh and high energy, and like San Vansterdam itself, the soundtrack will evolve with every season."</p>
<p>Music licensing is a real pain for game developers; we've previously seen entire titles<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-blitz-being-removed-from-digital-stores"> delisted from digital storefronts due to music licensing issues</a>. By keeping the in-game track list fresh and changing it with the seasons, the publisher can better control what goes in and out of the game, and simply remove a track from rotation if the license expires. I think that's also a better example of skate culture, to be honest: in my misspend adolescence in skate parks, I learned so much new, interesting music from listening to what the other skaters were blasting out of their crappy, battery-powered speakers hooked up to their iPods (I was just a bit too old for the boombox era, sadly).</p>
<p>So far, Little Simz and Skeggs are also mentioned for the soundtrack, but not a lot of other bands are confirmed yet. So that's six out of - assumedly - 100 artists we've locked in. There's plenty of scope for some really cool stuff to get in here. Just do me a favour, EA, and don't include Lupe Fiasco's Kick, Push. It's been done to death at this point. If you want mellow, go for something like Brave Baby's Plastic Skateboard, instead: it's far better for those late night sessions on the concrete with your pals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cal Kestis, the hero of EA's Star Wars Jedi video games, will appear in a spin-off TV series — marking his first voiced appearance in another medium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The redheaded Jedi will play a role in new episodes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/lego-star-wars-rebuild-the-galaxy">Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy</a> set to debut on streaming service Disney+ next month. A non-canon spin-off set in a "What If?"-style remixed Star Wars universe, Rebuild the Galaxy previously introduced the world to Darth Jar-Jar. Who knows what this second round of episodes will see Kestis (or an alternate universe version of him) get up to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, Kestis will once again be voiced by Cameron Monaghan, in the actor's first voice role as Kestis outside of a video game. News of Monaghan's return, as well as Kestis' appearance on a poster for the series, come amid fan speculation the Jedi may eventually turn up in live-action form — something Monaghan himself has said he is open to. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Monaghan has said he would "absolutely" want to portray Kestis in live-action, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-actor-explains-conditions-under-which-hed-play-cal-kestis-in-a-live-action-project">the actor has also said the project would "have to be right" for the character</a>. "By that I mean, it has to continue the story or the character in some way," Monagahan said in March 2024. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't want him to just kind of show up to stand around and be there. I want him to mean something and for there to be a significance for the character itself. So, it would have to make sense. But in the right context then, yeah, absolutely."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kestis' appearance in Rebuild the Galaxy marks the latest appearance of his popular character outside of Respawn's Jedi series, alongside other elements from the games. Kestis already has a spin-off novel, Jedi: Battle Scars, and popped up in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, a smartphone game also published by EA.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/mv5bnjgxyzc5ntgtyzvkms00zgjlltgyn2utngrmntk5njq3yzrjxkeyxkfqcgc-v1-1755269445515.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kestis features on the Rebuild the Galaxy Disney+ poster, alongside Mando, C-3PO and Princess Amidala.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time, various elements from the Star Wars: Jedi series have popped up elsewhere. A droid of the same model as Kestis' loyal companion BD-1 is featured in Episode 5 of The Book of Boba Fett (you can also buy the droid as a LEGO set), while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Season 1 of Ahsoka</a> saw the titular Jedi use psychometry. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2020/01/07/canon-force-powers-star-wars-healing">This rare force ability allows Jedi to detect echoes of the past by interacting with objects or locations</a>, and was taken by some as an indication that Ashoka had encountered Kestis at some point in her past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this just Disney having fun with its vast cast of Star Wars characters, a reminder there's still a third Star Wars: Jedi game from Respawn on the way, or a tease that fans can expect yet more from Kestis (and Monaghan) in future? Time will tell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Rebuild the Galaxy launches via Disney+ on September 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
