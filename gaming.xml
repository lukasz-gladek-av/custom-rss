            <p>Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-bioware-devs-reveal-exodus-a-sci-fi-rpg-shooter-about-time-dilation-featuring-matthew-mcconaughey">announced back in December</a>, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.</p>
<p>Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mara-Yama, horrifying Celestials, twisted into monstrous forms, are unlike anything humanity has ever faced in the battle for survival. The Mara-Yama feed on fear, delight in cruelty, and revel in the agony of their prey. They aren't just hunters - they are sadistic predators who savor every moment of psychological torment they inflict.</p>
<p>Stalking the deepest shadows of the Centauri Cluster, the Mara-Yama strike without warning, targeting the isolated and unsuspecting. But they're after more than cargo - they harvest minds, memories, and even emotions, leaving survivors forever haunted by the terror that hides between the stars. Few escape their grip, but those who do know the frightening truth that lurks out there in the void.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've yet to see any in-game footage of Exodus. While there's definitely room for a new sci-fi yarn in the Shepard vein at the minute, I hope it's not <em>too</em> much like Mass Effect, and is able to do something fiddly and fancy with time dilation in particular. Signing up McConaughey must have cost a pretty penny - it'd be a shame if the Interstellar connection turned out to be purely a question of cutscenes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Don’t Nod, the developers behind Life Is Strange and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, is facing layoffs. The French studio announced on Wednesday that it was launching a “reorganization project” that could affect “up to” 69 jobs.</p>



<p>“Amid deteriorating results, and despite the actions already taken, the company is now compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem,” Don’t Nod said <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">when reporting its latest earnings</a>.</p>



<p>“This project could impact Don’t Nod’s workforce in France and may affect up to 69 jobs. An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies, and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project.”</p>



<p>The studio added that the reorganization is aimed at strengthening the role of its editorial committee to meet market expectations, restore organizational agility, align technologies for better efficiency, and secure the company’s financing.</p>



<p>“Management is committed to fostering dialogue with employee representatives, with the aim of reaching agreements on accompanying social measures, including the possibility of a voluntary redundancy plan, should the project be adopted,” Don’t Note said.</p>



<p>Despite the falling revenue and reduction in staff, the company says ongoing development of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage as well as two other games will continue.</p>



<p>Don’t Nod reported an 11% decline in revenue for the first six months of 2024. It also announced a write-down of €24 million ($26.1 million) due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor performances of Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. Another €7.6 million ($8.3 million) write-down was made due to the temporary pause of games P12 and P13 in order to “prioritize resources and maximize the chances of success for the most promising titles at present.”</p>



<p>There was no mention as to what areas of Don’t Nod would be impacted by the layoffs, or when they would take place. Insider Gaming will have more when that information becomes available.</p>

"Hotfix #28 addresses a few crashes and blockers, integrates a handful of gameplay bug fixes, and resolves some issues with the Mod Manager," Larian said.</p><p>Though myriad improvements are hitting all platforms, the PS5 gets namechecked a few times in particular. PS5 players will enjoy quality of life improvements such as the Continue button working the same as Load Game in terms of reporting mod issues, the Mod Manager now correctly reporting the amount of remaining memory after uninstalling a mod, and the fixing of a bizarre bug that saw the DualSense lightbar update with different colors for every single frame of gameplay.</p><p>Larian has otherwise fixed the animated downloading bar not appearing when downloading a mod, addressed a crash that occurred when changing pages in the Mod Manager, and improved loading times for players with many mods installed. The full patch notes are available below.</p><p>Mods are certainly proving popular with Baldur's Gate 3 players, who have collectively <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-downloaded-more-than-15-million-mods-since-patch-7-arrived">uploaded more than 1,000 mods and downloaded more than 15 million</a> as of October 1.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Kepler Interactive and Sandfall Interactive confirmed the release window of the Unreal Engine 5-powered turn-based roleplaying game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The game will be released in Spring 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, becoming available on launch day via the Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, we also learned the main cast of voice actors, and there are some truly big names involved. To begin with, Charlie Cox, who is most famous for his portrayal of Daredevil in the Marvel TV series and the feature film Stardust, is Gustave, one of the protagonists. Gustave is a resourceful and dedicated engineer who devotes the last year of his life to defeating the Paintress and reclaiming a future for Lumiere's children. The other protagonist, Lune, is played by Kirsty Rider, who starred in The Sandman as Emanuela and also featured in the game Sifu. Lune is described as a passionate scholar and magician intent on unraveling the mystery of the Paintress and tasked with finding a way forward for the expedition.</p>
<p>Award-winning actor and director Andy Serkis certainly needs no introduction. He'll play Renoir, a forceful and passionate man who understands that victory requires sacrifice and is willing to pay the price. Ben Starr, who played Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI and will soon be featured in Warframe: 1999 as Arthur (Excalibur), is Verso, a dangerous stranger and outsider of unknown origin who follows the expedition closely.</p>
<p>Jennifer English, who received acclaim for her performances as Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate III and Latenna in Elden Ring, will be Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Maelle is a shy loner who sees the expedition as her chance to explore the world beyond Lumiere and forge her own destiny. Two more Baldur's Gate III alumni, Devora Wilde (Lae' zel) and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira) will be featured in undisclosed roles, just like Rich Keeble and Maxence Cazorla. Lastly, Shala Nyx, who played Nita in Netflix's film The Old Guard and Farida Nazeri in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty), will star as Sciel, a cheerful and calm warrior who is deeply committed to the expedition's cause.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Cast Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykQuuDwKRpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 aims to spruce up things within the turn-based RPG genre with real-time actions during combat. Story-wise, the game is set in a fantasy world inspired by France's Belle Époque, where each year, a mysterious being called the Paintress condemns everyone of a certain age to vanish into thin air. This time, though, the 33-year-olds are planning to fight back.</p>

This bit isn’t too terrible to deal with, but the second its shell cracks open, the situation changes…fast.</p><p>Once Homo Avades recovers from the first truly major damage you inflict on him, it’ll grow some creepy tree branch arms, and a mob of soldiers will spawn inside the cracked-open shell. Get more out of life; tell your kids this is where babies come from and ruin their childhood. Anyway, once it’s the mob’s turn, they’ll swarm your team, before the tree hands seal the egg back up and keep it warm by regenerating a big chunk o’ health. The arms will get a little more involved after this point as well, using Swiping Arc to inflict Slash damage to your team. When the heartpipes get low on health, the head will use Sour Scream, which gives him four extra turns. Yikes.</p><h2 id="h24090"><a id=""></a><strong>Archetype Recommendations</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-recommend-id="image://33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-recommend-id="image://33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pointman on this one is gonna be Brawler. At this stage, it’s the only class that can deliver the Strike damage naturally that you want to deliver on the egg portion of this fight. Yes, the Healer can too if it’s got a strong enough melee weapon, but the Healer being weak to Strikes as well is a real problem you don’t want to be dealing with at the wrong moment. That said, for gits and shiggles, it’s not the worst idea to put some Fire magic on the Brawler using Inheritance or an Igniter so they can do some damage to the arms when the time comes, too.</p><p>Second, bring a Warrior. Nobody’s particularly weak to Slash here, but all of its special attacks do excellent damage in a short period, which you’ll want for the heart phase of this.</p><p>Lastly, you’ll want a Seeker for one thing only: The Horse-Drawn Carnage Synthesis, which absolutely demolishes the egg every time.</p><h2 id="h24091"><a id=""></a><strong>Defeating Homo Avades</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-recommend-id="image://45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-recommend-id="image://45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So this thing, thankfully, isn’t as terrifying as he looks. There are just quite a few moving parts, and you’ll need to know how to prioritize.</p><div><p>First things first, though: on your initial turn, you’ll have your way with this thing. Ignore the heart for right now. Target the shell portion, have the Brawler throw a Perfect Punch, and your Knight throw Horse-Drawn Carnage. Those two alone are usually enough to crack the egg and reveal the tasteful dining room set inside, and I don’t think I’ve said “where do they come up with this shit” nearly as often with any RPG as I have with these <em>Metaphor</em> Humans.</p><p>Anyway, once the egg’s cracked, Homo Avades will collapse just enough to allow you to do proper damage to the heart on its head. The heart doesn’t have any exploitable weaknesses, so the Brawler and Seeker can hit it with whatever. For your Warrior, though, Slicer will do a really nice chunk of damage that the others won’t.</p></div><p><strong>When Eggman’s back on his feet, the real game begins</strong>. A veritable Helm’s Deep of soldiers called Assailants will spawn in the dining room set, alone with two creepy tree branch arms. Your first instinct will be to try to take these guys out, and by all means try with Perfect Punch and Horse-Drawn Carnage again. If you can get enough damage in, you might be able to wipe out the army before they swarm you. Chances are decent that you won’t though. It is what it is, you can take that hit at full health. After the hit, the arms will regenerate the shell, and you’re back to square one.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a4efd17c8cc40df9c9032ff6227fe3e" data-recommend-id="image://8a4efd17c8cc40df9c9032ff6227fe3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1906" data-height="1072" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I have no idea whatsoever.

Not being able to see this image gives you a better idea of what's going on than looking at it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Second verse, same as the first. Crack the shell open with Strike damage, bring the heart down until Homo Avades gets back up, and the army gets summoned. This time, though, Gallica will chime in, offering to throw down with the army on your behalf. Let her do it, and she’ll take a giant chunk of health off of those guys. If you’re wondering, quite logically, why she doesn’t do this more often, that she’s utterly gassed afterward and will be out of commission for the next turn answers that question then and there.</p><p>Once you have control again, finish off the Assailants, but then you’ll want to focus your attention on the arms. They’ll be attacking the team on their own, using Slash attacks, while the heart still tosses out occasional magic spells. Target only one arm at a time, primarily using Fire damage from whoever has it to exploit their weakness, and get as much juice out of your turn as you can. At this point, the constant team attacks from both arms and heart can get a little overwhelming if you just sit here in this state too long, so you’ll want to balance attacking an arm with damaging the shell. Once the shell breaks, prioritize healing your team up before attacking the heart. Once Homo Avades rises up again, repeat the process—Gallica can only go after the Assailants every other turn, so be prepared to potentially take a hit from those guys when she’s recovering.</p><p>The arms aren’t terribly difficult to bring down, however, and once you’ve taken out one, you’ll notice that the remaining arm still heals the shell, but only for half of its HP. Things get much, much easier from here. Focus on the other arm while doing shell damage. You won’t be taking nearly as much damage with the second arm out of the equation, so unload as much as possible on the heart when it’s down. Repeat the process until the second arm is dead. From here, the shell regenerates on its own, but only for 50HP. Now you can crack that thing open by breathing on it too hard. You can truly focus on simply damaging the heart, while mitigating the Assailants’ attack. Keep it up, and Humpty Dumpty will have himself a great fall.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Fiend was a creation of Bray Wyatt that allowed the wrestler to channel his darker side out. With the persona, he captured the WWE Universal Championship twice, but quickly disappeared from television and was subsequently released in 2021. Wyatt, real name Wyndham Rotunda, made his way back to WWE television with a new look, and began a feud with LA Knight, but was randomly dropped entirely. Rotunda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-superstar-bray-wyatt-suddenly-passes-away-at-36/1100-6517207/" data-ref-id="1100-6517207">passed away</a> in August of 2023 at the age of 36, but will live on in a brand-new bundle pack for WWE 2K24.</p><p>2K has announced a DLC pack that includes a new look for The Fiend character that was never worn in WWE programming. Fans got a sneak peek of the design on the Bray Wyatt: Becoming Immortal documentary, which was intended to be used on his eventual WWE return that never came. The mask was co-designed by Wyatt and Jason Baker of Callosum Studios--the collective of Baker and special-effects legend Tom Savini.</p>

      </div>
<p>There are three different ways to obtain the new content, but the specific setup and naming convention gets a little confusing. First, there is the Bray Wyatt Edition of the game, which comes with the base game, the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition Bonus Pack, the Deluxe Edition Bonus Pack, the Nightmare Family Pack, a season pass, the Showcase Superstar Unlock, and an additional 67,500 VC. This colossal set retails for about $140.</p><p>Then, there's the Bray Wyatt Bundle, which retails for about $90. That includes the core game and the Bray Wyatt add-ons, and 47,500 VC. Lastly, there's the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack, which is available today at $10, if you just want the new Wyatt content.</p><p>Aside from the brand-new Fiend look, the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack includes a playable in-game Mattel Bray action-figure skin, an updated playable Bo Dallas as Uncle Howdy, "The Fiend"-themed championship belt, a Firefly Funhouse MyFaction manager card, and a collective 47,500 VC.</p>

Max is easy to root for because she’s someone we already know. But since the events of the first game, she’s understandably more world-weary and reticent, having&nbsp;experienced trauma and grief in the most monumental sense — one that, in fact, erupted in an outsize calamity. It’s also why <em>Life is Strange</em> is so profound. The disaster isn’t just a plot device but an apocalyptic event that represents the heartaches of teenagehood in all its raw, unabashed glory.</p><div><p>And after nine years of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22661479/life-is-strange-true-colors-review-xbox-ps5-switch">exploring</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod">other stories</a> (as well as a change of developers), the series finally returns to Max — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">the protagonist who turned <em>Life is Strange</em> into the phenomenon it is today</a>.</p></div><p>Max is still Max in <em>Double Exposure</em>, and the new game feels largely familiar. So far, I’ve played the initial two chapters of the game (there will be four in total), and the first begins with Max breaking into an abandoned bowling alley with her new friend Safi, a colleague she met when she took up a position as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University. She’s still looking for great pictures to snap and trading friendly barbs with Safi, whose gregariousness mirrors that of Max’s close friend (or high school lover) Chloe Price.</p><p>In between examining objects and ruminating on them — a <em>Life is Strange</em> staple by now — Max is also taking pictures of whatever catches her eye. A stain on the wall that creepily resembles a face? Shelves of old bowling shoes that are left behind? The tall, dead-eyed statue of the bowling alley mascot? These are all sights that you can snap photos of as Max, who then uploads them to the in-game social platform, Crosstalk. Max and Safi then scamper out of the bowling alley a few moments later, flushed with adrenaline after a close call with one of the alley’s crumbling displays.</p><p>Such smaller, unhurried scenes among Max, Safi, and other characters of the <em>Double Exposure</em> cast make up the good half of the first chapter. If you’re familiar with the cadence of the series, you’ll see that these quieter moments prop up the game’s melodrama, fleshing out the more affecting moments that inevitably arise later. The cast, distinct and quickly likable (except for those you love to hate), points to developer Deck Nine’s forte of writing endearing personalities. Focusing the game on the cast is a decision with huge stakes given the character-driven tale of <em>Double Exposure</em>, but it pays off — at least early on. The professor Lucas Colmenero, for instance, is deliciously obnoxious, which makes humiliating him at every turn particularly delightful.</p><p>Then there’s the murder mystery aspect. Of course, things are never tranquil for long in <em>Life is Strange</em>, much less for the hapless Max, who would eventually suffer another loss again — one that she’s unable to reverse with her time manipulation powers from the original. That’s because Max doesn’t have that power anymore. Instead, it has evolved into another twisted form: the ability to rip a cosmic hole between alternate realities. In one, a new friend has been murdered, but in the other, they’re still alive. The events of the two parallel realities are starkly different, and Max will be traversing between them to get to the bottom of this mystery. Then there’s another skill that Max has called “Pulse.” This lets Max catch a glimpse of what’s taking place in the parallel reality, without having to physically travel there. The two skills enable Max to snoop around places or eavesdrop her way to secrets.</p><p>The way supernatural abilities serve as an allegory for its cast’s growth has always defined the series, and this is a fascinating development for Max. No longer are we constantly rewinding time and examining the minutiae of conversations like we did in the first <em>Life is Strange</em>. After all, she no longer believes in the invincibility of teenage exuberance to transform the very face of reality (although you can always load a previous save). But at the same time, things can get a tad confusing as you mentally keep track of the affairs between the two universes, while events diverge in two vastly different paths. In the “Living World” — that is, the reality in which your friend is still alive — the holiday spirit may be in full bloom but characters are still embroiled in disputes and inner turmoil that don’t surface in the “Dead World.” Fortunately, Max takes careful notes of everything in her notebook, but I still found myself forgetting some details while blasting between these planes.</p><p>That said, Deck Nine’s decision to only introduce Max’s new powers late in the first chapter, rather than getting down to the supernatural business quickly, points to the game’s emphasis on relationships rather than detective work. And the latter isn’t difficult to figure out as long as Max stares at and monologues over every object in the area. But with chapter two concluding in a jaw-dropping cliffhanger, there’s a chance that <em>Double Exposure</em>’s mystery narrative will soon take precedence over the quieter, reflective moments in the upcoming chapters.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, get ready for the inevitable heartache. While <em>Double Exposure</em> may no longer be centered on teenage woes, world-rending despair is a timeless emotion. The pains of being human transcend age, after all.</p><p><small>Life is Strange: Double Exposure <em>launches on October 29th on the Switch, Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The existence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/knights-in-tight-spaces">Knights In Tight Spaces</a>, sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fights-in-tight-spaces">Fights In Tight Spaces</a>, implies the existence of an unknown quantity or perhaps, an <em>infinity</em> of follow-up games that rhyme with both of those. Frights In Tight Spaces is the obvious horror spin-off. Sleights In Tight Spaces would be an urban pick-pocketing sim. Fights In Trite Spaces is about arguing with people on social media. Ah, you could spend a whole article, indeed, a series of articles, just fleshing out the iterations. Fortunately, Knights In Tight Spaces has a new demo to distract me.

I don't even need to play the demo to endorse it. For you see, I owe developers Ground Shatter and publishers Raw Fury a write-up from a hands-on way back at GDC 2024. I've forgotten a lot of the detail and my notes consist entirely of phrases like "Mites In White Laces = insect high school sports day dramedy????" but the summary is: game good. 
</p>
<p>
I didn't play the original much so can't draw any granular comparisons, but the basics appear pretty much the same. It's a turn and grid-based tactical puzzler (hey, I thought people had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-think-theres-no-point-competing-with-xcom-after-their-lamplighters-flop-its-winner-takes-all-in-the-tactical-gaming-space">given up making those?</a>) in which you defeat superior enemy numbers by means of varied ability cards (there are over 300 to unlock), smart positioning and cunning terrain effects. Simply going bevor-to-bevor with opponents won't cut the mustard; you must delicately work the crowd like you're setting up dominoes with chopsticks, tricking enemies into bopping their friends and other such comickal shenanigans. 
</p><p>
The difference is that this time round, you start with a party of character classes, such as archers and mages. Each has the skillset you'd approximately suspect from the name. This boisterously shoves the game a few grid squares in the direction of non-puzzle tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. There's more opportunity to batter enemies unscientifically, if you think you have the stats for it. But it's still more of a puzzler than an attritional exchange of blows/fireballs, and the newly party-led approach suits the choice of a medieval fantasy premise.  
</p>
<p>
"Weirdly, the thing that felt most underdeveloped was the setting," Jai Singh Bains wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fights-in-tight-spaces-review-a-unique-twist-on-the-deckbuilding-genre-that-pulls-one-too-many-punches">our review of the first game</a>. "As integral to the game as it is, there's not really a story". It feels like they've tried to address that. Beyond the battles, you'll pick paths through an overworld, undertaking primary and secondary quests and clicking through some sparse but colourful dialogue. They've also plumped up the art direction - it's grittier and slashier of texture than the previous game's spy thriller whitebox, while still offering up a world of sharp outlines and stark colours. 
</p>
<p>
The Next Fest 2024 demo gives you access to a couple of classes, the Rogue and Cleric, and a selection of weapons and levels, including a boss level. Catch it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/">Steam</a> - the full game doesn't have a release date yet. I've been trying to think of an absolutely hilarious rhyming title to end on but urgh, the spark has gone. Please, help me achieve closure and fill the comments thread with your suggestions - I'm sure the developers won't find it utterly unbearable in the slightest.

On your HDTV. In 4K.” That’s a tall order, but selling retro magic has been the company’s ethos for years, beginning with the SNES-inspired Super NT, and then the Analogue Pocket, based on the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. </p><p>Like those systems, the Analogue 3D uses FGPA technology to recreate the N64 at the hardware level rather than relying on emulation and will be compatible with all N64 cartridges (you’ll need to own the physical games rather than use ROMs). It also includes four original controller ports for your old, tri-pronged paddles, and comes with a new operating system that should make navigating menus and taking screenshots a much breezier experience. </p><p>“Analogue has developed the first, ultimate solution to play N64 today in total fucking glory,” CEO Christopher Taber told <em>Kotaku</em> last year. “Despite all of the amazing love, effort and work that developers have put into the software emulation of the N64—it results in an experience that feels unjustly and wrongly aged—generally ‘off.’ Flatly not a good experience. Coupled with Original Display Modes recreating not just the video game system, but the other critical contextual pieces (analog televisions, CRTs)—it’s difficult to overstate how fucking mint Analogue 3D is.”</p><p>While $250 covers the price of the console, an 8BitDo 64 controller will be sold separately that connects wirelessly for just $40. The N64 was home to <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, the original<em> Super Smash Bros.</em>, and tons of <em>Mario Party</em> games. Analogue touts it as one of the best retro couch co-op consoles of all time. Hopefully the 8BitDo 64 controller can support that dream with limited lag for anyone who doesn’t have their old N64 controllers lying around, or, more likely, busted the center joysticks on them long ago.</p><p>The Analogue 3D comes in both white and black, and pre-orders will be available starting on October 21 at 11:00 a.m. ET. The company’s CEO, Christopher Taber, previously told<em> Kotaku</em> that since its not a limited-edition product, “we will produce to meet demand and continue to make Analogue 3D available into the foreseeable future.” It’s a shame it won’t make it out in time for the holidays, but the company says orders will start shipping out in the first quarter of 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-lays-off-1300-at-oregon-facility/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The planned 15,000 layoffs at Intel are underway as the company is letting go 1,300 people at its Oregon facility in Gordon Moore Park&nbsp;location.</p>



<p>According to local paper <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/10/intel-will-lay-off-1300-in-oregon-as-part-of-broader-companywide-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Oregonian</a>, the 1,300 people are roughly 5% of the workforce in the state.</p>



<p>The layoffs are part of Intel’s plan to make $10 billion in savings for 2025. According to the company, revenue has fallen by roughly 33% since 2021.</p>



<p>“As part of the broad-based cost savings plan we announced in August, we are making the hard but necessary decisions to reduce the size of our workforce,” Intel said in a statement via The Oregonian. “These are the most difficult decisions we ever make, and we are treating people with care and respect. These changes support our strategy to become a leaner, simpler and more agile company as we position Intel for long-term sustainable growth.”</p>



<p>At the start of 2024, Intel, the largest corporate employer in Oregon, employed 23,000 people. While not confirming the amount, Intel says that some employees took early retirement or buyouts as part of the headcount reduction efforts. </p>



<p>Those who took buyouts, per the report, received 13 weeks of pay plus an addition 1.5 weeks for each year they worked for Intel. They also received a year of health care benefits.</p>



<p>The notice was given to those at the location on Tuesday. The layoffs are expected to be official in November.</p>

                <p>2K Sports has announced that NBA 2K25 is adding a wild-looking new mode, Gravity Ball, and it's going to cost you extra. The mode launches on Friday, October 18, and will cost $8.</p><p>But what is Gravity Ball? The 3v3 and 5v5 mode is described as a fast-paced online multiplayer game that's playable through NBA 2K25's The City. Gravity Ball takes place in a futuristic low-gravity arena and calls on players to zip around the map and collect balls to score. Take a look at the announcement video below to get an idea about what the mode is all about.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0WjRnTDqfw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y0WjRnTDqfw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gravity Ball was made by Visual Concepts South, the team that made NBA 2K25's go-kart racing minigame, The Track. Gravity Ball started as a passion project before expanding to become a real game that 2K is now going to sell within NBA 2K25. The Track, by comparison, was free.</p><p><span>"I like to think of Gravity Ball as a mashup of American-Gladiators-meets-futuristic-basketball-meets-paintball," Visual Concepts president Greg Thomas </span><a href="https://medium.com/@GregThomasVC/nba-2k25-gravity-ball-36f0b2e0ec6e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a><span>. "Pure off-the-walls mayhem. We've had so much fun playing amongst ourselves, we knew we needed to find a way to share it with you. Leveraging NBA 2K25's platform has given us that opportunity."</span></p><p>Thomas said the team was trying to make something new and fun for players, and noted that he's excited by the idea of giving the team a chance to have their passion project find an audience instead of getting left "on the cutting room floor."</p><p>Gravity Ball will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this Friday, October 18, priced at $8. It will not be available for the PS4, Xbox One, or Switch versions of the game.</p>

            <p>
If you love <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> so much you absolutely must plaster it over every available surface despite the fact it's not even out yet, Microsoft has you (and all your Xbox hardware) covered with its new Black Ops 6 Accessories Collection - featuring two customisable Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 themed controller variants, and a matching Xbox Series X wrap.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the controllers, Microsoft's Black Ops 6 Accessories Collection includes a themed Xbox Wireless Controller as well as a fancied-up Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2. Both, explains Microsoft's reliably overblown marketing spiel, are designed to "capture the tension and intrigue of the '90s spy thriller theme" and include visual elements that "immerse players deeper into the game's world". I'd argue looking at the screen is probably a more effective way to immerse yourself in the game's world, but do whatever works for you.
</p>
<p>
The newly announced controllers are <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/accessories/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accessories">available through Microsoft's Xbox Design Labs website</a>, meaning they're fully customisable aside from the mandatory Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 skin. The standard controller configuration starts at £84.55 in the UK (that includes the base controller, the Black Ops 6 skin, and a metallic orange d-pad that you can ditch if you'd prefer something else) while the Elite Series 2 starts at £124.99 for the base controller and Black Ops 6 skin.

<p>
Both controllers can be purchased right now, and a matching Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 wrap for Xbox Series X, costing £49.99, is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/Xbox-Series-X-Console-Wrap-Call-of-Duty%C2%AE:-Black-Ops-6/8nr7r4wm4pwg/WGFL">currently available to pre-order</a> ahead of its 23rd October release via the Microsoft Store. Pre-orders placed before the end of 22nd October include a token granting players one hour of double Black Ops 6 XP, but only "while supplies last".
</p><p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 the game releases for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC next Friday, 25th October. It's also available as part of a PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, but there'll be no sneaky signing up for a free one-month trial to check it out, seeing as Microsoft has just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-pulls-11-xbox-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release">yanked the offer</a> ahead of Black Ops 6's launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/juice-demo-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273350/Evolve_Stage_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evolve</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447150/APE_OUT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ape Out</em></a> and the surprise ending of that one popular indie game from 2016 I won’t spoil even though I think we’re past the spoiler window just in case you haven’t played it, where you play as the monster instead of (or, in <em>Evolve</em>’s case, in addition to) all the humans trying not to get eaten by the monster? I love that stuff. In the demo for in-development indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844430/Juice/?curator_clanid=33026434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Juice</em></a>, you get all the fun of being the monster, plus a snippet of the dread of being the person.</p><p>The <em>Juice</em> demo is very short, roughly ten minutes of what developer Colorfiction calls a “dual narrative” about being an escaped monster terrorizing a city, but also a person living in that city. As the monster, you chow down on hordes of people. As the person, at least in the demo, you stare at the news and look out the window as chaos overtakes the city.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="JUICE - Colorfiction - Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsIOweJoxcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Warning: flashing lights</figcaption></figure></div><p>The game’s Steam page seems to suggest the monster will evolve through the full game, and also that the human will encounter it somehow, reading “Barricade your Apartment from impending Death and brood the nights away as your world is ripped to shreds. Attempt the daily routine or embrace the Filth.” The Steam description asks “Who will emerge victorious?,” but I love the possibility that you’re just a normal person and not some gun-wielding hero who has to take the monster on.&nbsp;</p><p>Mechanically, <em>Juice </em>is pretty simple: you can run and attack, and there’s not much strategy to eating all the people. I tried to be very methodical at first, but then I quickly realized that I could just run through areas gobbling everyone up, and the game became a riot of sound and splashes of red. I loved the contrast between the monster’s freedom of movement and the spaciousness of its world compared to the cramped apartment and limited interactions of the human, and I hope that contrast persists in the full game. But both parts were confusing and a little bit pointless in an oddly satisfying way, more an experience than a game. Judging from the developer’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/colorfiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games</a>, this seems to be their vibe, though those other games look a bit more peaceful.</p><p>There’s also an arcade mode where you’re just the monster in a people-eating arena, which the developer says will feature <a href="https://x.com/colorfiction/status/1846034554957811879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some kind of competition</a>. My brief time with <em>Juice</em> was a little nauseating (the game warns you that it contains flashing lights) but also compellingly weird, and I’m definitely curious to know more about what the full game will look like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-64-reimagining-analogue-3d-delayed-to-2025-first-look-revealed.1011225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Analogue 3D, a machine that aims to replicate N64 hardware without the need for emulation, has been delayed to 2025, but creator Analogue has also released the first images of the machine.</p>
<p>Analogue first revealed the Analogue 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64">back in October last year</a>; in fact, news of its delay comes exactly one year after its original reveal, which is somewhat poetic.</p>
<p>When the machine was announced, it was set to launch sometime this year, but according to a press release (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/preorders-for-analogue-3d-a-4k-nintendo-64-start-monday/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via CNet</a>), the 3D will now be launching sometime in the first quarter of next year instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-goldeneye.jpg?itok=R-41nDGR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-goldeneye.jpg?itok=qP4_BaUd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Analogue 3D will come in both black and white.</figcaption></figure><p>Preorders for the Analogue 3D will open on October 21st at 8am Pacific (that's around 11am Eastern), so if you're looking to pick one up, make sure you're ready with your details when that time comes around.</p>
<p>Analogue has also revealed an 8BitDo controller intended for use with the 3D, and it's been designed to "retain the original size, sub-layouts, and feel" of the N64 controller. Don't worry, though; it won't replicate the awkward form factor of Nintendo's original hardware.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, said controller won't ship with the Analogue 3D, so if you're looking to play your N64 games with a controller that won't cause your hand to go non-Euclidean, you'll have to fork out an extra $40.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the Analogue 3D, it's a machine that's intended as a reimagined version of the Nintendo 64. Analogue proudly states that the machine doesn't use emulation; instead, it uses an FPGA chip "for absolute accuracy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-multiplayer.jpg?itok=CHeGU2i3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-multiplayer.jpg?itok=CVf1vK11 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Analogue is referring to the original N64 here, not its own 3D.</figcaption></figure><p>The 3D comes from the same company that made devices like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-pocket-portable-gaming-handheld-announced">the Pocket</a>, and it's aiming to provide flawless compatibility with original N64 cartridges while still offering 4K upscaling.</p>
<p>Since the machine uses FPGA rather than emulation, you won't experience glitches like input lag, graphical inaccuracies, or frame rate issues; Analogue is promising "the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise".</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the Analogue 3D, you can head over to the device's <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3d" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website right here</a>. The 3D will be available for preorder via Analogue's <a href="https://store.analogue.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store</a> on October 21st.</p>
