And if you unlink later, you “will be constrained to relinking to only that specific and originally linked” Microsoft account.</p><p>The requirement stings given that there’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/dont-buy-forza-horizon-5-again-on-ps5-just-yet-its-missing-one-crucial-feature">no cross-platform saving</a>, so the progress you make in the PS5 version isn’t reflected in the Xbox version. It’s the same situation for the Steam version, as the FAQ points out. As the page also notes, <em>Horizon 5 </em>players will need a PlayStation Plus subscription to access the game’s multiplayer feature, and there are “no plans for a disc release.”</p><p>When <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>releases on the PS5 on April 29th, it will be the latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date">Xbox exclusive</a> to make the leap to Sony’s console, joining games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, which also <a href="https://support.seaofthieves.com/articles/18270908747282-PlayStation-sup-sup-5-Microsoft-Account-Linking">requires you to link a Microsoft account</a> before you can play.</p><p>Gamers haven’t been keen on required account linking when Sony has done it in the past. The company actually removed a requirement for you to sign in with your PSN account for some PC versions of some games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">Helldivers 2</a> </em>and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601909/playstation-is-dropping-its-account-linking-requirement-for-some-pc-games">more recently</a>, <em><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></em> and<em> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.</em></p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-colelctors-edition/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

			<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/22/a-way-out-review/">A Way Out</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a>, you know what you’re going to get from Hazelight Studios’ latest game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. Given their popularity, it’s a wonder why nobody else has really sought to imitate their particular brand of co-op gaming, with its forced split-screen, endlessly inventive gameplay combinations, and fractious character partnerships that gradually work their way together over the course of a dozen or so hours.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es6YsZUxLpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like Amazon backing a film or TV project with an anti-capitalist message and evil, bald billionaire boss, there’s something a bit jarring to EA publishing a game that basically has an amalgamation of EA and Ubisoft as the villains of the piece. Mio and Zoe have been suckered in by the promise of getting one of their stories published, but Rader is actually intent on draining them and a clutch of other wannabe writers of all their ideas and inspirations.</p>


<p>The pantomime villainy goes so far that the actual CEO is directly responsible for them ending up in the same VR brain-draining machine together, and there’s no way of getting them out safely… for some reason. Instead, they have to fight their way out, using the appearance of glitches to move between worlds drawn from their own minds, breaking the imagination-sapping machine and using their combined abilities to overcome these creations.</p>


<p>It’s a classic case of two total opposites being forced to come together. Mio is a sci-fi writer who deals in dark and gritty dystopias, while Zoe is a nature-loving fantasy writer. They hate each other’s stories, Zoe getting under Mio’s skin, whether it’s despairing at the bleak worlds she’s conjured (and the thinly veiled inspirations) or the boundless positivity that shines through her own fiction.</p>
<p>Truth be told, there’s probably a reason why they’re unpublished writers. The opening hours of the game aren’t exactly narrative masterpieces, playing into genre tropes or riffing off blockbuster game franchises – there’s a whole Halo 2 sequence, for example – and so much of the game’s dialogue is spent telling you what you’re about to come up against instead of letting these worlds flourish on their own. The reaction that Mio and Zoe have toward each other’s work also feels shallow and immature, not really helping you warm to the pair.</p>
<p>Of course, as you progress through the game, they gradually warm to one another, and we get to understand the underlying inspirations that are drawn from their real lives and backgrounds. You can see these reveals coming a mile off, but they’re handled well and feed into the game worlds you’re experiencing excellently.</p>

<p>As you reach each new world, Mio and Zoe are handed strongly contrasting abilities, making you collaborate and communicate all the way through as you play. It can be Mio having a ninja sword that can also latch onto gravity-shifting pads, while Zoe has a grapple beam to move objects around, or Mio has a monkey transformation while Zoe becomes a fairy. How these abilities are combined is as inventive as ever, and Hazelight never stick around with a single concept for very long or it diverts to a bombastic action set piece before returning to an idea, and then building up to some spectacular boss battles.</p>
<p>That variety is helped furthered by the optional Side Stories that you find dotted throughout. You see, it’s not just the main story that they’ve been working on that is presented here, with Rader’s inspiration sucking machine actually drawing out every single story and idea they’ve ever had – could they be any more evil? They’re smaller asides that bounce you to the opposing genre for a brief interlude, taking half an idea that might not fit with the main story and just having a bit of fun with it.</p>

<p>They can be co-op puzzles, action set pieces, or just moments of childlike whimsy… like being a sausage that needs to cook themselves, get doused in ketchup and mustard, and then hop into a nice bun, ready to be eaten – I wouldn’t be surprised if this is actually a little story from Joseph Fares’ daughters, or something he came up with to entertain them specifically.</p>
<p>The co-op is presented once more as a dynamic split-screen view, regardless of whether you are playing locally or online –&nbsp;once again, the Friends Pass allows you to buy one copy of the game and play online with someone who hasn’t bought it, and now with cross-play. There’s typically an even split down the screen and you have individual control, but depending on the scene and the moment, the view can shift to give you a shared world view or put emphasis in different places.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes a little cramped when you want a better horizontal view, but the action is generally active and engrossing enough that you’re completely sucked into your own side of the screen, and only remember that you can look at the other side if you get stuck and need to natter about what you’re doing.</p>
<p>The game’s opening hours aren’t as memorable as in It Takes Two, and there’s some inconsistency in how interactive and fleshed out each world and idea is, but it finds its groove as you reach the middle third – helped by some of the more outlandish Side Stories – and by the time you reach the game’s final couple hours, Hazelight really flex their creative muscles. There’s so many standout moments built around one-off ideas, Hazelight knowing how to toy with everything they’ve established up until that point, and playing with your expectations to great effect.</p>

<p>According to the official <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/39144665637651-Forza-Horizon-5-on-PS5-FAQ">Forza website</a>, linking a Microsoft account to a PSN account is on a "title-by-title basis and permanent".</p>
<p>"Players have the ability to unlink the Microsoft account to that PSN account, for Forza Horizon 5, but will be constrained to relinking to only that specific and originally linked, Microsoft account," it explains (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/forza-horizon-5-will-require-a-microsoft-account-to-play-on-ps5-raising-preservation-problems">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>You'll also require a PlayStation Plus subscription, too, to access online multiplayer features, but solo and offline play is available regardless of whether or not you have a PSN account.</p>
<p>According to Does It Play - a group dedicated to the preservation of video games and their respective systems - this addition of a Microsoft account "basically kills preservation for the PS5 version of Forza Horizon 5".</p> <div>

<p>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to Sony's console on 25th April 2025, and new content for all platforms is also on the way. It originally released back in 2021, taking the acclaimed open-world racing series to Mexico. Eurogamer called it "another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-review-the-ultimate-big-tent-driving-game-cruises-to-mexico">our Recommended review</a>, highlighting its racing's "enviable tightrope-walk between structure and player freedom".</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5's leap to PS5 comes after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">confirmed its new multi-console release strategy</a> and follows the jump of other "exclusive" Xbox franchises like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment on PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As we creep ever closer to 13th April, HBO has dropped an all-new teaser for the second season of its critically-acclaimed series, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>Once again, the teaser shows just how closely the TV adaptation mirrors the game, with some scenes seemingly reenacted shot-for-shot from The Last of Us Part 2, including the barn dance and the hospital basement.</p>
<p>Please note, <strong>there will be some story spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 - and therefore potentially the show - below</strong>.</p>

<p>The teaser is barely two minutes long, but it sure packs a lot in, giving us a peek at the Scars, the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) soldiers, and Nora, bathed in the blood-red light of the hospital basement.</p>
<p>We also get brief glimpses of Dina and Jesse, a familiar-looking troop stomping through the snow on a mission, and the museum visit, too.</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, we also see an Infected slowly exhaling a plume of spores into the air. Whilst much more in keeping with the original game narrative, it perhaps hints at how the Cordyceps infection has adapted to survive for the show's second season.</p>
<p>As the words "Every path has a price" flash up towards the end of the video, Ellie looks at Joel in disbelief and says: "You swore".</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>. It will, however, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, we learned Joe Pantoliano, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Robert John Burke, and Noah Lamanna <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">will all be joining Bella Ramsey's Ellie and Pedro Pascal's Joel</a> when the second season airs next month.</p>

			<p>Former Xbox Corporate Vice President Peter Moore was featured in a lengthy interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfdz5alCu8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Danny Peña podcast</a> to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Xbox 360 console. The executive, who also had prominent careers at SEGA and later Electronic Arts before leaving the industry, highlighted the different state of the gaming market nowadays and whether the Xbox console would still exist in the future.</p>
<p><em>What's happened with the acquisitions made by Microsoft... I still say, look, if they had the choice, would they make hardware? No. They would be delighted if they could be a multi-hundred billion-dollar entity delivering content directly to the television, to whatever monitor you choose to play on in the classically Netflix model, if you will.&nbsp;You just select who's playing this? 5,000 people playing this? </em><em>I'm going to jump in right now, no latency, no lag, you're in. There doesn't need to be a box between you and your controller and the TV set. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard changed things, I think - </em><em>not I think, I know - at Microsoft and so this is not the old days of the console wars and punching each other and trying to steal customers, get market share, and build your attach rate. This is bigger than that in an economic sense. Has it lost a little bit of the feistiness that the industry I think fed upon and grew upon? I think so, yeah. </em></p>
<p><em>I've been gone from the industry for eight years. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-peter-moore-liverpool-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left EA to go to Liverpool in 2017</a>, so it's been a long time. Do I yearn for the old days, do I look back fondly when things crop up in my social media feed, like&nbsp;this was you 15 years ago and you see great photos of things in E3? Yeah, but I think we as an industry then positioned the industry for where it is now. It's different. </em><em>What Microsoft is doing is no longer the 'we're going to get as much content on Xbox, our singular platform, and the PC and we're going to fight for that, we're going to pay for that, and we're not going to give it to anybody else'. Those days are clearly over, as you can see.</em></p>
<p>Moore's opinion is not that much of a revelation, given that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella plainly <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-game-pass-netflix-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> in the past that the goal with Game Pass was to create a Netflix-like game subscription model. However, that objective was met with a crash course against reality over the past few years, marking stifled growth for the subscription service even after massive games like Starfield and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> joined Game Pass from day one.</p>
<p>It appears that gamers do not really want a Netflix-like model. However, Moore's musings still have relevance as Xbox fans fear for the future of their console now that Microsoft has elected to publish all their games on formerly rival platforms, like Sony's and Nintendo's consoles. In that regard, there is a chance Microsoft eventually won't deem it worth it to make any more Xbox consoles, especially if the downward trend in sales continues unabated.</p>

<p>If you’re tasked with killing Snallygasters in Fallout 76 for a daily challenge, you’ll want to head to the nastier areas of the map, typically where you’ll find swamps, toxic pools, and other environmental hazards.</p>



<p>The best place to find a Snallygaster in Fallout 76 (or three) is the Flooded Trainyard.</p>



<p>If you head to the Flooded Trainyard in Fallout 76, you’ll be greeted by as many as half a dozen Snallygasters, ripe for the taking.</p>



<p>But where is the Flooded Trainyard?</p>



<p>Well, you’ll need to head out to the Cranberry Bog to find it:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best Snallygaster location in Fallout 76 is near Hemlock Holes in the Toxic Valley at the top of the map.  If you head south from Hemlock Holes, you’ll find Snallygasters and even a Grafton Monster.</p>



<p>Hemlock Holes can be found here:</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-gulpers-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Gulpers in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It can be quite tough to track down a decent Gulper location in Fallout 76, but it’s not impossible. If you want to find Gulpers for a Fallout 76 daily challenge, you’ll need to head into The Mire and track through the dark and dingy forest.</p>



<p>The best place to find Gulpers in Fallout 76 is at the Gulper Lagoon – the clue is in the name, you see.</p>



<p>Here’s the top spot for Gulpers for daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Alternatively, you could wait around for Moonshine Jamboree to pop. That event is positively bursting with Gulpers, so you’ll complete this daily challenge to kill Gulpers in no time at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-teapots-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Teapots in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It might seem bizarre, but Fallout 76’s daily challenge structure can include a request to find teapots for no reason whatsoever. It’s one of the trickier daily challenges as it requires you to find something small in a <strong>very </strong>large map, and ground loot can often seem randomised.</p>



<p>Fear not – it’s not all that difficult to find a teapot in Fallout 76, and if you need multiple, you can try server hopping to see if more teapots pop up.</p>



<p>To secure the best teapot locations in Fallout 76, you’ll want to check out the Palace of the Winding Path. At this location, you’ll find more than a dozen teapots scattered around.</p>



<p>This is where you’ll find teapots in Fallout 76 with ease:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find teapots at the Palace of the Winding Path, you can try elsewhere. The next best location for teapots in Fallout 76 is Helvetia, the small town near Vault 76. Here, you’ll find half a dozen (or more) teapots lurking around:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-mirelurk-eggs-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Forget the Mirelurks themselves, some Fallout 76 daily challenges want you to find <strong>Mirelurk Eggs</strong>. As you can imagine, you’ll almost always find the two together, so it could be a case of killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>It’s easy to find the best Fallout 76 Mirelurk Egg locations, though.</p>



<p>If you head to Quarry X3 in the Cranberry Bog, you’ll find dozens of Mirelurk Eggs. Be warned, though – you’ll have to tussle with Mirelurks and even a Mirelurk Queen if you’re unlucky:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best location for Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76 is around the Ohio River Adventures site. If you explore the riverbanks around this location, you’ll find Mirelurk Eggs everywhere:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-rabbits-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Rabbits in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s tough to find Rabbits in Fallout 76 because they’re so small and they blend in well with the environment, but with a keen eye (and perhaps VATS), you’ll be able to find a few for your daily challenges.</p>



<p>The best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76 is near the Whitespring Bunker. Here, you’ll need to explore the area, but you should manage to find Rabbits easily and tick off some Fallout 76 daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any Rabbits near the Whitespring Bunker, you can try checking the Twin Lakes location in the Savage Divide. This is the next best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-bobblehead-in-fallout-76">Where to Find a Bobblehead in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Every Fallout fan knows about the Vault-Tec Bobbleheads. They’re everywhere throughout the series, and they come with some seriously helpful character upgrades.</p>



<p>In Fallout 76, Bobbleheads tend to spawn in static locations, which means they’ll always be there whenever you jump onto a new server – unless someone has grabbed one first.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76:</p>



<p><strong>On top of the mansion at Clancy Manor:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Camden Park, near the Minor Miner Zone Sign or on top of the Widowmaker rollercoaster</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Morgantown Airport, sitting in a quarantine tent and in the laboratory hanger near the airstrip</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are hundreds of Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76, but these are some of the most reliable. Let me know in the comments where you go to find Bobbleheads in Fallout 76.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-magazines-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Magazines in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Like Bobbleheads, Magazine locations in Fallout 76 are static, and you’ll find consistent spawns everywhere. Unfortunately, Fallout 76 Magazines are also in high demand all the time, so you’ll need to have luck on your side <strong>or </strong>have access to a private server to find one.</p>



<p>There are some top Magazine locations in Fallout 76 that you can try checking before you’ve even walked too far from Vault 76, which is nice.</p>



<p><strong>Check the south cabin and the treehouse in the Alpine River Cabins:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the main reception counter, the kitchens, and the bunk beds in Bolton Greens:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the airplane seats, the kitchen platform, and the cockpit of the plane at Horizon’s Rest:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of these locations yield multiple Magazines in Fallout 76, so you should be able to find at least one or two to resolve these daily challenges.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-wood-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Wood in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s a relatively mundane thing to track down, but many daily challenges in Fallout 76 revolve around finding building materials. In this challenge, you’ll be tasked with finding Wood locations in Fallout 76. It might seem easy, but it’s not – you can’t just go cutting down trees, after all.</p>



<p>The best location to find Wood in Fallout 76 is at the Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. This location can be found in the Savage Divide close to the Sons of Dane Compound, and it’s bursting with Wood for daily challenges in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-soap-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Soap in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Finding Soap in Fallout 76 is important, as keeping clean in the harsh, post-apocalyptic wasteland is something all explorers should be doing. Perhaps not, but that doesn’t stop the Fallout 76 daily challenges circuit from tasking you with finding stacks of Soap in the game.</p>



<p>It’s a little tougher to find Soap as it’s not guaranteed to spawn in many places. However, I’ve tracked down the best locations for Soap in Fallout 76, so you don’t have to.</p>



<p>The easiest location for Soap in Fallout 76 is at the Whitespring Resort. Here, you can access the Whitespring Mall, and from there, you’ll track down the Whitespring Spa. In the Spa, you’ll find up to <strong>seven </strong>Soap at one time:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any at the Whitespring Resort, you can find Soap in Fallout 76 by heading to Darling Sister’s Lab – just don’t ask me what they were doing with this much soap:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here, you’ll find <strong>seven </strong>Soap just sitting in a wheelbarrow.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-montage-lets-slip-that-two-fan-favourite-rifles-could-be-coming-back.1129299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Activision took to social media to promote International Women’s Day with a Call of Duty trailer focused on female characters. The punchy montage showcased some of the most popular female streamers and in-game operators, but it also let slip a few key details about the future of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In a couple of sequences in the montage, we see current operators running around with AMAX and Kilo assault rifles. These instantly recognisable weapons were firm favourites when Verdansk was rolling around in Warzone between 2020 and 2021, and it looks like they’re coming back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hit-the-nostalgia">Hit the Nostalgia</h2>



<p>It was mentioned recently that if Verdansk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">return to Warzone is a flop</a>, Warzone itself could be on the rocks and scheduled for closure. At the very least, Activision will scale back resources and prepare to keep Warzone afloat with a skeleton crew, as the downfall of the battle royale has been unravelling over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>When season three arrives in Call of Duty next month, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">a sizeable delay</a>, it should bring with it the original Verdansk map from 2020. That’s not all, though – according to the recent Call of Duty montage released by Activision, we’re also set to get some OG weapons back, too.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: The Kilo 141 and AMAX are officially returning to Warzone with Season 03! </p><p>Confirmed by todays IWD trailer posted by Call of Duty! <a href="https://t.co/RWxBbxw8zv">pic.twitter.com/RWxBbxw8zv</a></p></div>— Task Force News (@TaskForceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaskForceNews/status/1898397599930986953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I’m holding out hope that the Grau makes a return, but I’ll settle for the AMAX and Kilo. There are so many ‘meta’ weapons that Activision’s teams could bring back to Warzone, but I <strong>really hope </strong>the DMR and Mac-10 combination is kept well away from this iteration of the battle royale game.</p>



<p>It’s not confirmed, but featuring the weapons front and center in a trailer this close to the launch of season three is pretty telling. If the original timeline were being adhered to, we’d be just ten days away from the launch of the game’s third season. Instead, we’ll need to wait until April 3rd.</p>



<p>What weapons do you want to see returning to Warzone this year? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-too-easy-making-tougher/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-%E2%80%98too-easy%E2%80%99-and-blizzard-is-preparing-to-make-it-tougher.1129290/</guid>

<p>During a recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s developers working on Diablo 4 reflected on the most recent season, suggesting that things didn’t pan out as expected. They confirmed that the game has become far too easy and revealed that players are levelling up in ‘half the time’ compared to previous seasons, even on harder difficulty levels.</p>



<p>As someone new to Diablo, I can attest to that. I’m usually awful at challenging games, but even after cranking it up a few levels, I’m having no issues whatsoever with Diablo 4.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-hell">Prepare for Hell</h2>



<p>When the next season rolls around in Diablo 4, players will find themselves levelling up slower and facing a tougher grind compared to the current season, which is focused on the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>



<p>In the recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s Colin Finer revealed that players are ‘chewing through some of the content’ much too quickly, hitting level 60 and securing their Paragon classification far too rapidly and with too few struggles.</p>



<p>In season 8, players will find that they’re levelling slower through the first 25 levels of a new character and that rarer loot – such as Legendary items – will be much harder to find.</p>



<p>Here’s the full campfire chat with Blizzard:</p>

<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/536470/diablo-4-blizzard-too-easy-season-8-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The team revealed that ‘too many’ players have found their way into the highest difficulty level of the game in record time, which represents a kind of imbalance in the player base.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is — in this case Torment 4 — to be aspirational, and to us that means around 10% (of players).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, around 50% of the players in the Vessel of Hatred season have made it to the highest difficulty level. To battle back against that issue, Blizzard will be adding new, more challenging boss characters in the new season, and existing bosses will have their abilities cranked to the max.</p>



<p>It’ll be a while before all that arrives, though. The next season of Diablo 4 isn’t expected to drop until April 29.</p>

<p>In the latest trailer for the second season of The Last of Us, we’re given a brief glimpse at the expansion of the story established in the 2020 game. It has been known for a while that the sheer amount of meat on the bones has given way to the second game having a two-series split in terms of the live-action adaptation, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunners from creating fresh storylines.</p>



<p>In particular, we’re given an extended look at the attack on Jackson—Ellie and Joel’s home haven in the game—by vast swathes of infected. This sequence isn’t replicated in the game, but some of the perspectives are reminiscent of No Return, the additional mode added with the release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-galore">Content Galore</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part II has plenty of inspiration to draw from when it comes to creating extra content for the live-action adaptation. In 2023, with the launch of the first season, viewers were treated to an entire episode that explored the backstory of Bill and Frank – and that sequence alone won the show an Emmy Award.</p>



<p>In the latest trailer, we get the idea that Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, and everyone else involved is following a similar pattern in the second (and assumedly the third) season of the HBO show.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once again, the cinematics smack of the most faithful recreation possible, and we can now see that a fair amount of flashback content will be included in season two. For instance, we’ll be heading back to the prequel scenes that see Ellie and Joel explore a museum on Ellie’s birthday, ultimately discovering a building packed with dinosaurs, spacecraft, and <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<p>We also get an extended look at the Seraphites, but it doesn’t look like Lev and Yara are being revealed just yet. We do see some other sequences that suggest the Seraphites and their background will be explored further in the show, which would help to set up a little more lore for those uninitiated in the story thus far.</p>



<p>The WLF is front and centre, too – as is Abby’s band of antiheroes heading to Jackson for no particular reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two drops on April 13 in full – are you going to binge watch this one? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Retroid, the China-based company that makes the Pocket Mini, announced on Discord that it will accept returns of the device but only during a limited March 8th to March 14th window — and capped at just 200 returns from owners who live outside of China, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/its-official-retroid-pocket-mini-shader-issue-cannot-be-fixed/"><em>RetroHandhelds</em> reports</a>.</p><p>Earlier in the week, the outlet says Retroid acknowledged it couldn’t fix the issue, which affects how the screen shows scanline and pixel grid shaders used to give classic emulated games the appearance of being played on the CRT displays they were designed for. The effects can show up as “misplaced scanlines, uneven pixels, or a slightly distorted image,” <em>RetroHandhelds</em> writes.</p><p>In this morning’s message, Retroid says carrying out this return campaign is a “large and costly endeavor,” and that it expects “a lot of return requests outside of screen-related issues.” Retroid also mentions it is asking customers to pay to ship their returns, which it promises to reimburse. Finally, the company added that it will offer all Pocket Mini owners “a $10 stackable coupon” for two of its future handhelds.</p><p>As Russ from the Retro Game Corps YouTube channel notes in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1j6ohs3/how_would_you_address_the_rp_mini_screen_issue/">post on Reddit</a> asking for recommendations to pass along to the company for dealing with the situation, Retroid is in a hard situation as a small company that now faces having to pay for very expensive shipping on returns. But that doesn’t change the fact that many gamers who bought the $199 handheld specifically to play retro games are left with a device whose otherwise impressive display does a bad job with some of the oldest tricks in the emulation book.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, HBO’s latest trailer doesn’t get into The Biggest Reveal (if you know, you know), but it does hint at the show’s inclusion of some of the most iconic (and infamous) scenes from the game this season is based on,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Some of the noteworthy scenes from the game that we see reflected in the trailer include Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) dancing in Jackson before the story’s big inciting incident occurs, Ellie interrogating Nora (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022">Tati Gabrielle</a></span>) in Seattle as part of her  quest, and what looks like Ellie discovering the truth about Joel’s  rampage against the Fireflies in Salt Lake City at the end of season one. The last of those is significant because the extent of Ellie’s knowledge about those events is kept  a bit of a mystery throughout <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and this version of the scene seems to take place in the Jackson settlement they both live in, rather than at the scene of the crime as it did in the game. It’s still unclear if HBO’s series will use the same flashback-driven structure as&nbsp;<em>Part II </em>did, but given that the trailers are showing off quite a bit of stuff, more so than the game did before release (in fact, the game went so far as to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-showed-a-fake-last-of-us-2-scene-to-preserv-1844099589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-showed-a-fake-last-of-us-2-scene-to-preserv-1844099589">fake some scenes for its promotional material</a></span> to conceal a big plot point), it doesn’t seem like the show is as concerned with keeping certain things a mystery&nbsp;as the game was in 2020.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>season 2 will premiere on Max on April 13.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
