            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-lower-end-ps5-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored PlayStation 5 handheld will unlikely be able to play PS5 games natively and will probably require dedicated versions of new games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">&nbsp;rumors</a> regarding Sony's return to the handheld market following the PS Vita, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> made some interesting observations on what the systems could actually be, highlighting how it will not be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, as what is currently achieved on a 200 watts system will be impossible to achieve on 20 watts system even in a few years down the road. As such, scaling down games will be required to get games to run on the system, similar to how the Nintendo Switch handles running games in handheld mode. Sony already showed how scaling up is entirely possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ultimate-comparison/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, so scaling down shouldn't be impossible.</p>
<p>The real question is how scaling games down will be handled by this PlayStation 5 handheld. The Microsoft handheld, for example, may be similar to how things are handled for the Steam Deck and similar systems due to the company's approach, letting the user tweak the graphics settings of the PC version of games to get games running decently. In addition, Microsoft could use the Xbox Series S profile available for all their games to get them to run decently on their handheld without leaving the user to configure settings. Sony, on the other hand, doesn't have a lower-end PlayStation 5 model, so the handheld would require dedicated versions of games, while older games would need to be patched in order to run on the system. As such, the PlayStation 5 handheld could be the PS5 lower-end system that Sony currently doesn't have that will offer a slice of what the base model offers in terms of visual fidelity and potentially backward compatibility.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation Handheld Is Real... But Will It Really Run PS5 Games?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh3lAfsKdrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the current reports suggest that this PlayStation 5 handheld is still far from release, so it will be a very long time before we can see what it will be capable of and if it will ever be able to put a dent into the Nintendo Switch's popularity, whose concept of home console and handheld all-in-one system will likely only get more popular with the release of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/">yet-to-be-revealed</a> successor.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-action-strategy-game-kingmakers-delayed-to-next-year.1052466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that ambitious upcoming action-strategy sandbox hybrid game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4445711438670988556" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a> (which is, rather amusingly, worded as though it were an old-timey town crier decree), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will now launch "nay later than the end o' Q1 2025". I suppose the originally-slated release window of 2024 was pretty much unattainable given we're in December now.</p>

<p>The premise of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is a pretty novel one; it revolves around players being able to travel back in time with modern weaponry and lay waste to medieval armies in order to change the course of a war and "stave off the apocalypse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=zY9dK4Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=WKlZAUh3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>promises some astoundingly historically inaccurate action-sandbox shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a million miles away from the premise of 2009 FPS&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>isn't an FPS; rather, it's an ambitious and sprawling mixture of action, strategy, city-building, and sandbox gameplay.</p>

<p>You'll engage in battles in which soldiers are "controlled by a next-gen multi-threaded AI" and animated by "a unique procedural animation system". In those battles, you'll use modern weaponry like machine guns, attack helicopters, and air strikes to "wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield".</p>

<p>The game will also feature base-building elements and real-time strategy gameplay; you'll be able to zoom out and issue orders to your soldiers before joining the fray yourself, watching the plan you've built be executed in real time.</p>




<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>may not be out yet, but its publisher tinyBuild clearly has faith that it's going to be a smash hit. Back in August, the studio announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in production</a> in conjunction with movie studio Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>We still don't have a full release date for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023" rel="nofollow">financial straits tinyBuild appears to be in right now</a>, it likely can't come soon enough. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward-one-week.1052463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has moved the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date forward a week, and there are new goodies coming for the game this week as well.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, the studio confirms that the game's new release date is February 4th, which is exactly a week before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">originally intended launch date of February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>That should come as a pleasant surprise for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>fans, especially since the game's original release date technically constituted a delay. It was originally meant for release sometime in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=2_uzGPdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=eC1LdW1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>a whole week early.</figcaption></figure><p>In the release date announcement post, Warhorse also says that more info about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way this week, with a new story trailer for the game set to debut later today.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll also be learning the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>PC specs this week, as well as "console specs", which presumably refers to what modes the console versions of the game will offer, as well as whether it'll join the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, an open-world adventure that emphasizes realistic combat and historical detail.</p>

<p>The second game will once again revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, which also means that like its predecessor, it'll be set in 15th-century medieval Europe.</p>




<p>As well as bringing back many elements from the first game, including multiple approaches to combat and quest completion,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will also feature ranged weaponry like crossbows, as well as firearms.</p>

<p>Lest you think the introduction of new features will cause Warhorse to scale the story back, however, think again; the studio confirmed back in August that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">contains over two million words</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 4th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-youre-not-imagining-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-combat-feeling-off-theres-a-good-reason-for-it">lack of hitstop</a> in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://x.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522">handy breakdown of the issue</a> by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.</p>

<p>"Some of the changes in the hitstop were obviously intentional, and some were not implemented due to the settings of the game," director Yuya Tokuda said at a recent press event, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-hitstop-feels-way-better-in-the-non-beta-build-and-the-games-director-was-happy-to-juice-it-back-up-after-overseas-players-apparently-hated-it-in-world/">via GamesRadar</a>. "When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> was released, many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too hard and it made it difficult for them to play. So it's very positive feedback seeing the users who experienced the [Wilds open beta test] this time saying that they missed the hitstop that they were experiencing in past titles."</p><p>"It's a very unique <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> experience being able to experience that hitstop," Tokuda continued. "So it's very positive feedback from my perspective. In the current version that I think you guys had hands-on gameplay with, there was obviously a little bit of adjustment compared to the [open beta]. And for the full product version, there will be adjustments. For example, the finishing moves will have adjustments to hitstop as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/were-at-the-next-level-monster-hunter-wilds-creators-on-the-secret-behind-capcoms-new-golden-era/">Very Gary Computing</a> also had a big chat with the Wilds team, in which series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto also mentioned some bugs from the beta they’d since ironed out. "The monsters were moving more often than intended," he said. "It wasn’t actually a design intention to have them be so rapidly moving, it was just that every X amount of seconds they just were moving on, and it wasn’t something we were planning for - the general processing of how monsters decide where to go next and what to do, that’s being refined towards the full game."</p>
<p>The VGC piece is well worth a read, not least for Yuya Tokuda going into detail about the new endgame it sounds they’ve got planned for Wilds:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects will be related to the environmental change system that happens in Monster Hunter Wilds. You’ll be doing things like having a synergistic relationship between the monsters that you’re hunting and the environment itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you hunt this monster now, that might make something happen like this one becomes easier to hunt later or harder to hunt later. The details are going to be discussed later, but I’m confident that players who love [past games’] end-game cycles will be really pleased with what’s in store.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion: bonk. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Google has developed a new AI tool that can generate a fully playable 3D game world from a single image prompt.</p>
<p>Genie 2, as the tool is known, is described as a "world model". So where Genie 1 generated 2D worlds, this subsequent tool can create 3D worlds in a variety of perspectives and includes the consequences of taking actions like jumping or swimming.</p>
<p>Google stresses the tool can be used for "rapid prototyping" as it "enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research".</p>

</div><figcaption>Is Sony buying FromSoftware's parent company the next big games industry acquisition?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqusIyhV2M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It works using a single image prompt, with Google of course using examples from its own text-to-image AI tool Imagen 3, though real world images can be used too.</p>
<p>From there users can jump in and interact with the world, with the AI overcoming challenges like understanding control inputs and remembering the world it's created as the camera pans elements in and out of view. It then generates new plausible content on the fly for up to a minute of gameplay.</p>
<p>It can further generate NPCs and interactions with them; the physics of water or gravity; lighting models and reflections; and multiple animations.</p>
<p>"While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie 2 is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI [Artificial General Intelligence]," reads a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">blog post on the tool from Google</a>.</p>
<p>So while the tool can be used for prototyping, it's also being used to train further AI models.</p>
<p>Discussing how Google developed the technology responsibly, the blog post reads: "Genie 2 shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse 3D environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early stages and we look forward to continuing to improve Genie's world generation capabilities in terms of generality and consistency.</p><p>"As with SIMA [Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent], our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world."</p>
<p>As such it's purpose as of yet doesn't seem to be directly in video game development, though the potential is clear.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a> with its use in multiple areas, from NPCs to scriptwriting and voice acting.</p>
<p>Multiple studios have already stated their interest in AI technology, both for and against it. Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst</a> stated AI technology has the capacity to "revolutionise" the games industry, but it won't replace the "human touch".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If you fancy taking a break from shooting alien scum in the face and would like something more relaxing for quite literally ten minutes then Short Trip may just be the thing for you.</p>
<p>It’s not a game as such and is described as an ‘interactive illustration’ which had been hand drawn of the course of five years. You get to control a cat tram through picturesque mountain villages, keeping to a schedule or going at your own pace. That’s it, a full play through will take less than ten minutes but I think it looks quite sweet.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 Slavic-inspired Medieval Village tech demo is now available for download, hinting at how <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/">The Witcher 4</a> could look.</p>
<p>The demo, whose regular version can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSL9vdiQYMJmn0cq5PNjBxBK5hEHXD4r/view">here</a> and the NVIDIA DLSS version <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxD3QoDPIErPv4WZUcazq2Csd7HmS1Rd/view">here</a>, was developed by Scans Factory and features a variety of atmospheric lighting scenarios that are a great fit for any fantasy setting with a dark-leaning tone like The Witcher series. In case you cannot experience the demo on your system, you can watch it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>In the past few months, Unreal Engine 5.4 has been used to power some impressive tech demos, such as another demo by Scan Factory. This demo features an i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-unreal-engine-5-4-ultra-realistic-rome-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpressive recreation of Rome</a>, which looks downright incredible with its attention to detail and how it manages to capture the spirit of the Eternal City.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">5.5</a>, which brings some new features that promise to be game-changing, such as MegaLights, which allows developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights to scenes without any constraints. You can check out how some of these features can be used by taking a look at an impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-unreal-engine-5-5-remake-download/">Zelda: Ocarina of Time fan made</a> remake demo powered by the engine.</p>

Infinity Nikki, a cosy free-to-play open-world experience about wearing the most beautiful dresses, is on first impressions outside of my realms of expertise. However, whether it’s the stunning visuals, the beautiful and evocative fantasy world, or its joyful sense of fun and playfulness, Infinity Nikki dispenses with your preconceptions in moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki: Official Release Trailer - About Wishes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BUFYjUv72Yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, Infinity Nikki is a game about dressing up, but it plays a more integral part than you might think. While some are purely visual choices, other dresses provide special abilities, whether helping you to leap further with a double jump, or providing the ability to purify darkness-tainted monsters known as Esselings. Heck, there’s one for grooming animals where you sneak up on them, Assassin’s Creed style, and then lovingly give them a thorough brushing down. You learn everything you need to know about the game in the outrageously cute reactions that each of these animals will respond with, including the sassiest squirrel in the world.</p>


<p>Fundamentally, dresses and their accessories function as your skill tree and you’ll need to craft each element of an outfit to unlock its ability. You do this by collecting the necessary components and acquiring a sketch of said outfit to work from, with each also giving Nikki access to a new look, some of which will automatically appear when performing that action, while others you have to select manually when you’re ready for a spot of animal grooming.</p>


<p>Infinity Nikki immediately beds you into its fantasy world with a hefty dose of storytelling, and your first experience of the game sees you transported from your dusty old attic to the broken and evocative ruins of a long-forgotten realm. Ena the Curator has been imprisoned here for thousands of years, but with Nikki’s arrival, and indeed the arrival of her spectacular dress, fashioned from the Threads of Reunion, she’s set free.</p>
<p>It’s a short-lived escape though, and in her last act she grants you the Heart of Infinity, setting you on a path to save Miraland, while undoing all of the wonderful fashion-based powers you’ve only just discovered. Cue a quest – more accurately a series of quests, tasks and asides – to gain back your powers and refill your wardrobe while you attempt to save the realm.</p>
<p>You’re not alone in your adventure, accompanied by the incredibly cute, and actually amusing Momo. This little guy immediately sold the game to my 8-year-old son, and frankly, to me as well, his antics causing us to actually laugh out loud. Very few games manage that. He’s a helpful chap to have along for the ride too, pointing you towards items of interest, and even letting you take direct control for a spot of platforming.</p>
<p>Dada from the Stylists Guild is also along to help with your journey, and she gives you a Pear-Pal tablet to keep you organised, setting you on course to become a Stylist. From here you can check out your wardrobe, Sketches and quests, as well as take Courses, which are milestones or achievements which in turn unlock further rewards.</p>

<p>Your sense of fashion isn’t all about those special abilities, and sometimes you just have to look your absolute best. Styling Challenges see you face off against other Stylists, battling them for fashion supremacy by choosing the most visually powerful outfit. Each challenge is given a theme such as Sweet, Elegant or Cool, and it’s up to you to pick the right look to win the day. Mixing and matching doesn’t always make you an immediate fasionista, but it remains consistently satisfying to win the day.</p>
<p>What might surprise you the most about Inifinty Nikki, is how much of a fully-fledged RPG it is. I know we’re past the point where mobile and free-to-play titles can match or even better their full-price rivals, but Infinity Nikki manages to reel you in from the very start. There’s a keen sense of style to everything here, from the beautiful vistas to the stunningly detailed clothing, and its open world is simply enjoyable to explore. I haven’t meandered quite so readily since playing Breath of the Wild and, if anything, Infinity Nikki offers you more to do.</p>
<p>Platforming plays a major part in your adventure, and thanks to Nikki’s dress-given abilities, you can climb incredibly high in a short space of time, While you do, you’re looking for Whimstars, essential for making progress, as well as the different crafting materials that abound in the overworld. Alongside that, you come across side quests and minigames, each of which will reward you with experience and money to fund your soon-to-be-problematic shopping sprees.</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of the Gacha genre, of course, and if you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> or any of its peers you’ll know what to expect. Different rewards for a huge spectrum of achievements will constantly pop, and each section of your Pear Pal will regularly sport a red notification, drawing you in for a little spot of euphoric back-patting.</p>

<p>These are the precursor to the monetisation for Infinity Nikki, where the team at Infold Games will be hoping you need that particularly spectacular skirt so much that you’re willing to put down real money for it, rather than embarking on an entirely free, but incredibly time-consuming grind. You can play quite happily without spending money, and I haven’t felt the need to put anything in thus far, but there’s the clawing idea that I will at some point. The most impressive, or stylistically powerful, additions to Nikki’s wardrobe look so much easier to get with real-world money.</p>
<p>You could argue that that’s only fair for a game that I’ve already plunged several hours into and which is genuinely good, easily eclipsing some of Square Enix’ most recent action-RPGs, but there’s still that feeling that you should be spending your money on something with more substance. I’d forget that for now. Overall, it’s not surprising to see Infinity Nikki take a similar route to MiHoYo’s offerings, but you can decide to ignore it, up to a point, and I genuinely don’t think you’ll regret your time spent here.</p>
<p>There have been a few technical hiccups in the pre-launch build we played, particularly through the tutorials, with occasional messages about an unstable network which we’re hoping will be ironed out at launch. Given the number of people waiting for that launch, you’ve got to hope that Infold Games have got as many servers dialled up as humanly possible. It’s also worth noting that your progress is saved to one specific server, so make sure you select the right one when booting the game, unless you want to start again from the beginning.</p>

			<p>20 years after its original release in Japan, Bandai Namco's Tales of Rebirth is finally getting an English translation patch this month.</p>
<p>As recently revealed by <a href="https://www.lifebottle.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Bottle Productions</a>, a team of dedicated fans who released last year a full English translation patch for what is, in my opinion, the best entry in the series, Tales of Destiny: Director's Cut, the translation patch for the PlayStation 2 version will be released sometime in December. Yesterday, it was specified on the team's official Discord server that they are aiming to have it out on the game's anniversary on December 16th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good morning, Twitter! We've got some big updates today. Our Tales of Rebirth (PS2) translation will be releasing sometime NEXT MONTH! Stay tuned for more info! Also, we made a bluesky for all of you who want to follow us outside of Twitter and Insta <a href="https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o">https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o</a> <a href="https://t.co/djSz9c0RsG">pic.twitter.com/djSz9c0RsG</a></p>
<p>— Life Bottle Productions (@LifeBottleProd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeBottleProd/status/1857417668669718704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Tales-of-Rebirth-English-patch-release-date.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides offering an English translation for Tales of Rebirth, which was never released outside of Japan, the Life Bottle Productions patch will also include some advanced features that will improve the experience, such as battle subs dynamically positioned on screen depending on how many items are obtained at the end of a battle or if the player is cooking, as highlighted by some screenshots by Julian Lightfellow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">More Tales of Rebirth refinement. End of battle subs are now positioned dynamically, depending on how many items you get, or if you're cooking. (And I'm cooking!)</p>
<p>Who's excited!? 😃 <a href="https://t.co/PUwts0OBCc">pic.twitter.com/PUwts0OBCc</a></p>
<p>— Julian Lightfellow (@JLightfellow) <a href="https://twitter.com/JLightfellow/status/1864030187093905498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tales of Rebirth is among the PlayStation 2 entries in the series that were never released in the West and probably never will, seeing as Bandai Namco seems more interested in bringing more recent entries in the franchise on modern platforms. Next month, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-graces-f-remastered">Tales of Graces F</a> will make the jump to PC and current generation consoles, complete with a variety of enhancements, such as auto-saving, the ability to turn off enemy encounters, improved visuals, and more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-path-of-exile-2-free-to-play.1052391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Path of Exile 2 is free to play, then not only does it follow in the footsteps of the original ARPG, but it also shows the community’s willingness and trust in supporting the eagerly awaited follow-up. Making PoE 2 free would be a huge decision, so let’s dissect Grinding Gear Games’ strategy.</p>



<p>Free to play has become the norm over the last decade. I remember PS4’s Warframe being free to play, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the decision to make a AAA title free. Now, everyone’s doing it, and it’s because the business model is highly sustainable—<em>sometimes</em>. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 1 was released in 2013, it was free to play, and it worked like a charm. Now, in 2024, it’s sequel time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-path-of-exile-2-pre-download-guide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>‘s free-to-play status is one of the biggest questions.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play">Will Path of Exile 2 be Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep your money to yourself. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 is free to play</strong>, and like its predecessor, requires no money to play, and its main way of generating income is through <strong>optional microtransactions</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of supporting the first game, the developer decided it was time for a sequel. The acclaim and adulation PoE received meant it was entirely feasible for Grinding Gear Games to make PoE 2 a pay-to-play adventure. </p>



<p>Path of Exile continually gained in popularity after its release, and <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/238960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> shows PoE has barely dipped below 10,000 players a day on Steam since Jan. 2017. The numbers have regularly dipped into the 60K and 70K region—achieving <strong>76,501 concurrent players in Aug. 2024</strong>!</p>



<p>The developer clearly trusts the PoE community, so this is presumably why Path of Exile 2 is once again free to play. If you do intend to support PoE 2, various Supporter Packs are available to buy with the cheapest one offering 300 Points and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> Key. </p>



<p>Conversely, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3349430/Path_of_Exile_2__King_of_the_Faridun_Supporter_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">King of the Faridun Supporter Pack</a> includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>1000 Points.</li>



<li>A Hideout</li>



<li>A Portal Effect</li>



<li>Early Access to Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Level-up Effect</li>



<li>Three Pets</li>



<li>Three Weapon Skins</li>



<li>Two Armour Sets</li>



<li>Two Back Attachments</li>



<li>Two Badges</li>



<li>Two Forum Titles</li>



<li>Two Hideout Decorations</li>



<li>Two Portrait Frames</li>
</ul>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s future doesn’t necessarily hinge on selling extras, but this surely goes a long way to helping its stability. I’ve no idea how PoE 2 is going to perform compared to the classic before it, but it’s going to be interesting to find out.</p>

<p>More Mortal Kombat insiders have corroborated last week’s claims that Mortal Kombat 1 future DLC has been cancelled.</p>



<p><span>Rumors began to swirl at the end of November when FateUnknown, a known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker, posted on Reddit that the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future DLC for Mortal Kombat 1 had been cancelled </a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to poor expansion sales.</a> </p>



<p>Subsequently, two other Mortal Kombat insiders have since come forward to corroborate the rumor. One such insider is X user (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1704677366629310953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thethiny</a>, who said, “The final insider has reached out and said that she also heard that there’s no more content after Terminator with a possibility of finishing what they originally had lined up since last year. Her KP3 list was also different. I have officially no hope left.”</p>



<p>KP3 refers to Kombat Pack 3, the next DLC to be released for the game. </p>



<p>As always, Ed Boon has refused to comment on the rumors, but Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>



<p>As previously pointed out by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown</a>, characters from Kombat Pack 2, such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2, are still to join the roster.</p>

            <p>Ananta, the free-to-play open world anime RPG formerly known as Project Mugen, has now been officially revealed with a full trailer.</p>
<p>The game was originally announced at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year but this slick trailer shows a first proper look at its Grand Theft Auto meets Spider-Man gameplay.</p>
<p>There's certainly a lot to take in: from its pop aesthetic and fake social media reports, to swinging and driving through futuristic streets, beating up oddball bad guys with eccentric moves and sneaky stealth, and looking cool in the process. At one point there's a man riding a toilet with legs. Check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>As for the weird plot, players will "take on the role of an elite Agent within the A.C.D. (Anti-Chaos Directorate) embarking on an exhilarating adventure through a world that breaks all the rules", according to the developer. "Nova City has plunged into Chaos, from spooky paranormal phenomena to toilets racing through traffic in the streets, the game promises to offer a unique blend of humor, adventure, and mystery."</p>
<p>The trailer certainly has shades of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to it and the stealth combat seems heavily inspired by Insomniac's Spider-Man series. The aesthetic also seems to sit somewhere between MiHoYo's work and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pearl-abyss-delays-creature-collecting-game-dokev">DokeV from Pearl Abyss</a>.</p>
<p>Still, even with its obvious allusions to other games, it looks like a fun romp - and the music is a bop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has confirmed work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, is still ongoing, despite pausing development to focus instead on Stardew Valley updates.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/">new blog post</a>, the creator noted it had been "a little sad to see Haunted Chocolatier getting dusty on the shelf", but as he got involved in the Stardew Valley 1.6 update as it grew from technical changes to content additions, it "kind of snowballed" and pulled him away from the next game.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">1.6 update arrived on consoles last month</a>, meaning Barone is now free to continue development of Haunted Chocolatier.</p>

<p>Barone explained his "strong sense of duty and obligation" to Stardew Valley players, but said he has a "strong desire to make more games".</p>
<p>"I like making games, and I have a lot more that I want to share, with Haunted Chocolatier and beyond," he wrote. "And even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree, in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas."</p>
<p>Before the release of 1.6, Barone had a "vertical slice" of Haunted Chocolatier, with the skeleton and most of its bones in place.</p>
<p>"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," he wrote. "Yes, it's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."</p>
<p>The release of Haunted Chocolatier is still quite a way away, then, but Barone won't be doing any early access, crowdfunding, or pre-orders ahead of its full launch.</p>
<p>"I will not release a game unless it is complete and I am very happy with it, and I think that's what most people would want, anyway," he surmised, though he will still be releasing development updates on occasion.</p>
<p>Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">first revealed Haunted Chocolatier in October 2021</a>, with Stardew Valley fans eager to find out more on his next project.</p>
<p>While similar to Stardew Valley in aesthetic, the game will see players running a haunted chocolate shop, along with monster hunting and life sim elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ananta has been revealed as the new name for Project Mugen by Naked Rain and NetEase, their upcoming ‘urban open world’ game that looks to take on the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> with a wild mishmash of gaming inspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>Ananta is in development for PC, mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>. Pre-registration is now available with the first tests coming in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="ANANTA | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KeN9CeJQi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s see, I can spot plenty of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 announce trailer</a> through the first half of the video, but it quickly becomes clear that this isn’t just an anime GTA-like when someone breathes an ice cream into existence, and a chainsaw car monster goes rampaging down a motorway. Also the bipedal toilet race…</p>
<p>Later in the trailer we get glimpses of gameplay inspired by Insomniac’s Spider-Man games, with grapple swinging through the city and stealthy superhero game action with environmental takedowns. That’s alongside the more standard action RPG combat with some over the top cutscene abilities. But there’s also plenty more of the open world GTA-like stuff with politely asking drivers to get out of their car for you and driving round the city, gun battles in a car chase, more standard car races, shooting hoops, weight lifting, darts, and more.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild mash of ideas, at times. So long as you can live with free-to-play gacha monetisation as seen in Genshin and ZZZ, this could be right up your street.</p>
<p>As for what’s actually going on in the world? Here’s some blurb from <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">Naked Rain</a>:</p>
<p>Welcome to Nova, the sun-soaked coastal hub that’s perfect for ditching winter!</p>
<p>This city is electric—whether you’re street surfing in Paradox Plaza or pulling marathon gaming sessions at Glimmergold, there’s never a dull moment. And with humans and Chaos living side by side, you never know what crazy twists your adventure might take!</p>
<p>Nova Tourism Board Pro Tip: Run into Chaos gone wild? Report it first, snap selfies later! Have a blast, but stay safe!</p>

            <p>Friday The 13th: The Game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> developers Illfonic have announced that they've laid off an unspecified number of staff as they "re-align" to "a refined strategy". No reasons for the layoffs are given in the statement, beyond a cursory gesture towards "the state of the industry".</p><!--more-->
<p>"Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic," writes CEO and co-founder Charles Brunghardt <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/illfonic_an-update-from-illfonic-activity-7270138603437989888-6BkN/">on LinkedIn</a>. "It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy. There is a lot of talent in this group and if you or your team is hiring, please reach out so people can be connected to open roles."</p>
<p>The announcement doesn't confirm which teams have been affected, but Illfonic have offices in Colorado, Washington and Texas, USA. The company employed 78 people as of 2019, though this was before the founding of the Texas office.</p>
<p>As Matt Wales <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">comments</a> over at Eurogamer, it's possible the layoffs have something to do with the expiration of the license rights for Friday the 13th, which obliged IllFonic and publisher Gun Media to pull the video game adaptation from sale last December. The studio's most recent asymmetrical horror games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a> and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, don't seem to have found a following, going by the latest Steam activity charts.</p><p>IllFonic had high hopes for Killer Klowns, despite the relative obscurity of the license, viewing it as more of an everyperson game than Friday The 13th. "We've found that asymmetrical horror games aren't always for the hardcore gamer, so we've really tried to balance this out to make it fun and interactive for any type of playstyle," CCO Jared Gerritzen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-multiplayer-horror-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-does-away-with-downtime">told Nic in May</a>. "We've found with [our previous games], fans that don't play videogames but love the IP will come in. With Klowns, this is that opportunity to bring that 'evade and escape' vs having that hardcore shooter mentality. I think we've got a really good balance."</p>
<p>I don't know the ratio of new hires to layoffs in 2024, but it's certainly been a "harsh" year for job losses. According to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">unofficial tracker</a>, around 14,000 people have lost their jobs this year, up from 10,500 in 2023. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">said goodbye to roughly 277 people in the course of "sunsetting" XDefiant</a>, their live service shooter. Brendy has been keeping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">an unofficial list</a> of the dire euphemisms companies use to sweeten the layoff pill in their official statements. For my money, the most baleful is surely Take-Two's "rationalizing" away the livelihoods of hundreds of staff. But "refining" your workforce is pretty obnoxious too, with its suggestion of purging the impurities during the smelting process.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all IllFonic devs who are now looking for work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's been a while since Arkane has shelved the Dishonored IP. Granted, that part of the story was successfully concluded with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of the Outsider</a> in 2017, but there are so many parts of that unique steampunk/dieselpunk world that would deserve to have their own games. Sure, it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Deathloop takes place in the same setting (albeit in the far future), but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>A proper Dishonored 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> alongside other unannounced Bethesda games (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 remasters, a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel) during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial in 2023, but none of those projects ever materialized, suggesting they were set aside after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax.</p>
<p>While the actual franchise may be lying dormant and there's no telling when it might return with Arkane Austin <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a> and Arkane Lyon busy with Marvel's Blade, Arkane founder and series creator Raphaël Colantonio promised fans they will enjoy the next project in development at WolfEye Studios, which will marry the likes of Dishonored and Prey with an additional RPG layer. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-raphael-colantonios-next-game-is-and-isnt-like-dishonored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>People who loved Dishonored and Prey are going to feel very at home. It's uncompromised… We are just going full on into that kind of game in the way we create worlds, the way we let choices to the player. And I think there are going to be even more choices this time because of the RPG layer. We'll have a lot of different ways to do things.</em></p>
<p>The game will be played in first-person like Dishonored. Colantonio also confirmed it will feature shooter-like gameplay.</p>
<p><em>There is something about real-time decision making, as opposed to everything being stats, that makes us feel more in the moment, more immersed. I'm surprised the intersection between RPG and first-person shooter has not been more of a thing.</em></p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, except that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more ambitious</a> than the studio's debut (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>) thanks to a generous investment received by WolfEye early on. We do know it is set in a steampunk world and a Limited Alpha will take place next year, with sign-ups open <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Holidays are supposed to be relaxing, but that definitely hasn’t been the case for Alex, the protagonist of Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. Between being caught in a storm, shipwrecked and washed up on a mysterious island, she’s also found herself in the company of some distinctly idiosyncratic people. Not only are they named after the Grecian gods, they’re all suffering from an unhelpful bout of amnesia, which, for someone who just wants to go home, is downright infuriating.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01kdNoJKfgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still, Alex has the kind of can-do attitude that many game protagonists have, and instead of sitting about in the doldrums, she sets about exploring the island, discovering what makes the inhabitants tick, and hopefully figuring out a way to get herself back home.</p>


<p>The interesting thing is, the inhabitants of Ambrosia Island actually are the Greek gods of myth, they’re just not quite as you’d remember them. Polygon Treehouse present to us their take on the gods, which is to say, they’ve been modernised and reimagined, opening up questions about the nature of godhood, of the passage of time, and of character through the lens of modernity. That sounds overtly serious, and Mythwrecked isn’t a ‘serious’ game, but it is one with charm, gentleness and compassion – a perfect antidote to this season’s crop of calamitous blockbusters.</p>


<p>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is the epitome of a chilled, cosy experience, and it’s easy to fall into the routine of searching the island, discovering new residents and helping them with their missing memories. Unlocking a memory has to be one of the game’s highlights, combining some joyous animation with further information and introspection from that character. Your first companion is Hermes, the messenger of the gods, but he’s lost his sandals and his satchel, relying on you to return them to him.</p>
<p>This is where you get to utilise the height of Grecian technology: the Ambrosidex. While there’s no Pokémon here, you are attempting to catch all the gods’ memories, and there’s a map, an inventory, and further lore for you to dig into within your device. Crammed in alongside, it also functions as a radar, bleeping away when you’re coming closer to a god’s lost items. With Alex’s quest to get home, and her commitment to helping the island’s residents, it is basically essential and helps to keep everything organised while you explore.</p>
<p>Hermes isn’t just good for spilling a few memories out of his winged mouth, he also helps you to fast travel around the island via Portal Doors, which you can unlock by swapping Ambrosia fruit for the corresponding key. Given that you’ll be collecting these fruit without even thinking, it’s a fair trade. He’s not the only one who’s after some fruit though, so you might want to balance out who you’re giving them to, at least to begin with.</p>
<p>Every one of the gods here is suffering from amnesia, and to build their trust in you, they each set you a task. These tasks in turn bring life back to the island, resurrecting the landscape and returning it to its former glory, while strengthening the corresponding god, and your relationship with them. Gods are always after offerings, and it just so happens that Alex is a kind and helpful soul who’s willing to do the legwork for them.</p>

<p>You soon settle into the rhythm of discovery and exploration, and though there are few actual puzzles, the island itself is one huge conundrum. There are myriad interlocking parts that you have to put together in a certain order to progress, and it’s a gentle gameplay loop that easily whisks away the hours.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that Ambrosia Island isn’t without its mild frustrations. Just like a real-life visit to a foreign place, you often have little idea where you’re going, and you’ll meander back and forth across the increasingly expansive island in search of various landmarks that you just know you’ve seen fifteen minutes before.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a map, and hopping in and out of it will point you in the right direction, though it won’t provide you with all the answers as to how to get there, and where precisely the thing is you’re looking for.</p>
<p>The soundtrack reflects the laid-back vibes, with your exploration set to plaintive acoustic guitar and the constant sound of waves crashing against the beach. There’s much more to experience here as well, with unlockable cassettes lying around the place, each with their own ditties, and there’s a ridiculous number of opportunities to sit and listen wherever there’s a tape deck and some comfortable cushions. In many ways, this is the heart of Mythwrecked, ensuring that you take your time, ease into it, and consider exactly why you’re here.</p>
<p>While Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island runs smoothly throughout, the audio levels are occasionally off-kilter – seriously, these are some <em>LOUD</em> sound effects, and the transitions between different areas can result in a less than enjoyable audio hiccup. There’s the option to turn different elements of the audio down though, which solves many of the issues, and hopefully these rough edges can be rounded off with a patch or two.</p>

<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $70 / £70</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 full game</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While it may seem obvious, the best gift you can get a Call of Duty fan this Christmas is the new title, Black Ops 6. While most will likely already have the game, this should certainly be the first consideration when gifting a CoD fan. </p>



<p>If you know what platform they play on, great, and if you know whether they’d prefer a digital or physical copy, even better. If they usually get games digitally, and especially if they have a PlayStation Digital Edition or Xbox Series S, you’ll want to gift them with a voucher for the platform so they can purchase it with ease.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that the price will vary depending on what edition you purchase, as you may find it cheaper at certain outlets. There are always some great deals around Christmas too, so keep an eye on Black Ops 6 as you may be able to get it on sale.</p>

<h2 id="h-cod-points">CoD Points</h2>

</ul>



<p>If they already have the latest title, CoD Points are an excellent alternative for CoD fans, as it gives them in-game currency that they can spend on cosmetic items like Operator bundles, Blueprints, and more. What’s great about this too is that the inventory is shared across Black Ops 6 and Warzone, so no matter what game they want to play, they’ll be able to utilize the gifted CoD Points.</p>

<h2 id="h-steelseries-headset">SteelSeries Headset</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>Wide range</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://steelseries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteelSeries website</a></li>
</ul>



<p>An amazing gift for any gamer is a SteelSeries Headset, and that’s even more so for a Call of Duty player since it’s an extremely competitive game. Having top-notch audio is essential for detecting footsteps and other audio cues, and SteelSeries are widely regarded as the best.</p>



<p>As an owner of a SteelSeries Headset myself, I can vouch for the quality. No matter what range you go for you’re guaranteed comfort and high-quality audio, but if you have a bigger budget I’d recommend the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, which is compatible with all platforms. </p>



<p>You should find some great deals on SteelSeries Headsets around the Holiday period too, so keep an eye out on places like Amazon and the official SteelSeries website.</p>

<h2 id="h-dualsense-edge-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">DualSense Edge / Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>
<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge – $199.99 / £189.99</li>



<li>Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – $179.99 / £159.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller-series-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the person you’re gifting for doesn’t have the premium controller offering for their platform of choice, the DualSense Edge for PlayStation and Elite Wireless Controller for Xbox are both excellent options if you have a high budget. Even if they’re on PC, these controllers can be hooked up to their rig and used, so it’s a great option for all platforms. </p>



<p>Call of Duty is all about having smooth aim and movement, and the controller is the main instrument for that. So, having a premium controller with extra buttons and customization options can increase performance and that’s something a CoD addict will value greatly.</p>

<h2 id="h-kontrolfreeks">KontrolFreeks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $/£10-20</li>



<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.kontrolfreek.com/products/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3f727ffb0&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KontrolFreeks</a></li>
</ul>



<p>KontrolFreeks are thumb grips that you attach to your controller’s thumbsticks for better accuracy and control. It provides extra height for the thumbsticks, which makes it easier to make more precise movements by increasing the arc distance. They have been proven to help accuracy and grip, something that’s ever-important in a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent accessory for any Call of Duty player, and they’re very popular. You can purchase Call of Duty-themed KontrolFreeks, making it the perfect gift for players grinding Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>

<h2 id="h-bo6-zombies-poster">BO6 Zombies poster</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>$27 / £22</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://eu.shop.callofduty.com/products/codtfa0015-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-key-art-poster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Shop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If they’re a fan of Call of Duty, they’re most likely a fan of the Zombies mode too. For Black Ops 6, Call of Duty have produced a Zombies key art Poster, featuring the full crew – Weaver, Carver, Auguinaldo, and Grey. </p>



<p>These characters are the latest Zombies crew, and since BO6 has brought back the classic round-based format, they’ll no doubt become iconic. If the first few maps are anything to go by, Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode will be a favorite that Call of Duty fans will look back on, and the poster’s vibrant colors make it the perfect addition to any gaming setup.</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-knit-beanie">Black Ops 6 Knit Beanie</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>$33 / £26</li>



<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://eu.shop.callofduty.com/products/codtmh0018-black-ops-6-beanie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Shop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Holiday season means cold weather for most, and just like everyone else, Call of Duty players have to stay warm! Featuring a woven Black Ops 6 logo and a wolf tag on the cuff, this knitted beanie is an ideal stocking filler for those enjoying the new Call of Duty game. It’s one-size-fits-all and 100% Acrylic Knit. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-bo6-magnet">BO6 magnet</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>$11 / £9</li>



<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://eu.shop.callofduty.com/products/codtnv0020-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-acrylic-magnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Shop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Another great stocking filler for any Call of Duty fan is this Black Ops 6 magnet. Now, you may wonder what a gamer wants with a fridge magnet, but these are great for sticking on PC towers and consoles. They’re also great for other metal accessories you’d find in a gaming setup, such as headphones, monitor arms, and water bottles. </p>



<p>The magnet features the iconic Black Ops sitting bull pose and if you’re wondering about its size and material, it’s an acrylic 3.5 x 5.5 in magnet.</p>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>$7 / £6</li>



<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://eu.shop.callofduty.com/products/codtdc0001-call-of-duty-metallic-logo-decal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Shop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, another small gift perfect for a Call of Duty fan’s stocking is this Metallic Logo Decal. Just like in-game, where players can customize their favorite weapons with colorful decals, this allows fans to customize a belonging of theirs with the iconic Call of Duty logo. </p>



<p>This vinyl sticker is acceptable for both indoor and outdoor applications, whether they choose to stick it on their console or car. It’s fairly large too, so it will stand out wherever they decide to use it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow.1052334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital have revealed that My First Gran Turismo, the free trial for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Turismo 7</a>, will go live on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 tomorrow. Game creator and legendary designer Kazunori Yamauchi explained the purpose of My First Gran Turismo in a post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>My First Gran Turismo is a special free-to-play invitation to dive into the exhilarating world of motorsports. This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first Gran Turismo, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving. Whether it’s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving, My First Gran Turismo was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn’t just about playing a game; it’s about embarking on a personal driving journey. We’ve made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that’ll steadily refine their driving skills.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXOQLqjBWb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The My First Gran Turismo trial will feature three Race Events, three Time Trials, three Music Rally stages, a full suite of License Tests, eighteen unique cars, and these three tracks: Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit. Owners of PS VR2 can also look forward to checking out the trial in virtual reality mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news about a PC version. Two years ago, Yamauchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a statement that ignited the hopes of PC gamers; however, he quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-pc-isnt-actually-in-development-confirms-yamauchi-series-has-sold-90-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recanted</a>, clarifying that while they were open to the possibility, nothing was being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>It's strange because Sony is slowly but surely porting all of its exclusives to PC. At this point, Gran Turismo 7 might be the biggest missing one, and it's all the weirder because adding such a big platform could definitely help fill out the online races.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever wanted to run and gun your way across the <em>Star Wars</em> universe? Did you watch the adventures of Mando and Grogu during the Mandalorian TV show and think, that's some of me right there? Well, the board game <em>Star Wars&nbsp;the Mandalorian Adventures</em> takes you right into the first season of the stellar TV show, featuring art, characters, and scenarios from it. In this review, we'll have a look at how it plays, who you can play, and will try to keep it as spolier free as possible.</p>

<p>We've covered a whole host of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed games on the site, from the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Unlnimted</a> to the miniature wargames <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">X-Wing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-core-set-review-pick-dark-or-light-and-go-to-war" rel="nofollow">Legion</a>, and also <em>Star Wars</em> video games like the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-2.jpg?itok=Ep5aY8o_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-2.jpg?itok=AoTktyCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> take place on a scenario map in pages of the game book.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars</em> <em>the Mandalorian Adventures</em> features an incredibly easy core set of mechanics, and also one of the best onboarding systems I've seen. The game takes place using a book as the playmat, a system we've seen used to great success in other tabletop games. The map pages also feature the rules for that scenario, keeping everything handily in front of you. As you progress through the game's scenarios, you'll add components until you've unlocked the whole game. This system adds in elements as you play, none of which are particularly complicated, but this feels aimed at non-gamers, rather than veteran tabletop players. I felt like I could have gone all in during the first scenario, but adding elements as you go does have a nice flow to it.</p>

<p>During the game, players take turns, acting cooperatively to complete the mission. Games can be played solo, with a player controlling more characters if that's your preferred style of play. Each character has a deck of 12 cards, and each card has a power, between 1 and 4. All characters start with 3 of each power, and you randomly draw 4 of those cards into your hand. Each turn you get to take 2 actions, which you do by placing a card in the action slot on the board. There are 4 types of action:</p>

<ul><li>Move - Which lets your character move around the map</li>
	<li>Attack - Which lets you try to take out the enemies on the map</li>
	<li>Intel - Which lets you view unknown threats, or move threats</li>
	<li>Plan - Which lets you draw cards from the planning deck that might help you later on</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=Uhn_WVG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=vk7mR8gJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After every game of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures,</em> you unlock new rules and cards from the Guide deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The power of the card you place in the action slot is how effective that action is. You can move further, attack harder, view threats further away, and draw more cards to find a good one. You can also only do each action once per turn, which adds a great tactical element to which 2 actions you pick, and which cards you place. If you can't quite reach to attack an enemy this turn, do you save your high power card for the attack, or use it to move this turn and attack with a lower powered card?</p>

<p>Once you've had your turn, the cards stay on the board, and after any player's turn, if the combined score of any cards in a slot is 5 or more, then an event happens, if the combined total is 6, then a crisis and then an event happens. This adds another great dynamic to the game as events/crises can never be avoided in total, but they can be worked around until you're in a better position to deal with them. It noticeability adds a risk element early game, as everyone wants to move, but if everyone does, you'll quickly have an event, so working out between you who should move and who should plan and intel the threats can work in your favor until you're ready to activate an event.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=BIlCh7ZN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=j5WJn-Y_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures</em> includes 8 playable characters from the first season of the TV show.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Can You Play In Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 8 playable characters, each with their own themed action deck. The characters you can play are:</p>

<ul><li>The Mandalorian</li>
	<li>IG-11</li>
	<li>Paz Vizsla</li>
	<li>Burg</li>
	<li>Migs Mayfield</li>
	<li>Xi'an</li>
	<li>Cara Dune</li>
	<li>Greef Karga</li>
</ul><p>Even though the power spread across all the decks are the same, each character also has bonus actions on their cards, which can be used if played for that specific action type. For example, Mando has the Beskar Armor Plan card, which instead of planning, if played in the plan spot, he can search the plan deck for a defend card, and Paz has the Heavy Blaster Cannon attack action, which instead of attacking, can be used to deal 2 damage to up to 3 different threats at 1 range.</p>

<p>Each of the characters feels unique, which I was extremely pleased to see. Getting theme into board games is challenging, and <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> manages to do it well, capturing each character uniquely and making the play experience with each, and with different combinations rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=742xQ-Ut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=Tmwwze1d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In each of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> decks, each character has a few unique power cards with thematic abilities.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Many Missions Does Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures Have?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 4 scenarios to play through in the map book, and each should be played in order as you work through the guide deck. Once you've played through and unlocked all the content, all of the scenarios can be played through again with different missions, and with different characters. I was actually surprised at the replayability of the game. It initially looked like it would be a quick and unrewarding experience, but there's a lot of replayability out of the box. It does also say that these are missions inspired by Season 1 of the TV show, so we might see another 2 games/expansions (and a bonus one for the Book of Boba Fett?).</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p>I was very surprised by <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em>. I'm a huge fan of the TV show, but at first, on reading through the rules, and seeing that it only had 4 scenarios, it looked very basic. But it actually has a lot of depth behind the simple mechanics. It's not hyper-tactical, but is it fun, and the onboarding is extremely well done. It would be very easy to get a non-gamer <em>Star Wars</em> fan to play this and enjoy it, without having to spend ages explaining the rules, or having to manage them while they play through the first game</p>



<p>If you're a Mandalorian or <em>Star Wars</em> fan, then you will almost certainly enjoy this. It's a great experience, with a lot more depth than I initially thought. If you're not a <em>Star Wars </em>fan, then this might lose a lot of its drive. The mechanics are solid, but there are other adventure-style games out there that you might enjoy more. If you've never seen <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;or the Mandalorian, then I would recommend watching the TV show first, as there are some spoilers in here about the characters and different situations.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch doesn't have an officially licensed guitar controller for Fortnite Festival, but it is getting a spiritual successor to a controller that was once bundled with Guitar Hero: On Tour for.... Nintendo DS. Yes, controller manufacturer CRKD is releasing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNKGYHP4?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Festival Edition</a> of its impressive Neo S Controller with a 5-fret attachment.

Playing Guitar Hero with cartridge slot attachment was actually pretty fun, so the Fortnite Festival Edition Neo S for Switch and PC sounds cool.

CRKD's Neo S is a pro-style controller in a compact form factor. It has Hall Effect analog sticks, which combat pesky stick drift, and has swappable thumbstick caps. Additional stick tops are sold separately in bundles of eight. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Deck/dp/B0CMV7N9XH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 stick top bundles in gray,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Midnight/dp/B0CMV7PCDS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a>, and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Stick-Tops-Nitro-Retro/dp/B0CMV8D8VP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">orange and black combo pack</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Neo S also also has Hall Effect triggers with customizable sensitivity via the CRKD mobile app. The easy-to-use app is where you go to map inputs, including the pair of remappable back buttons. The Neo S has adjustable rumble and motion controls, though motion controls will only work on Nintendo Switch. Within the app, you can turn on optional preloaded configurations, including a turbo mode.</p><hr><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Other CRKD Neo S models</h2><p dir="ltr"><b>$50</b></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408925" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408925"></a><figcaption>CKRD Neo S controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408925-neo-s-controller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">CRKD's Neo S first released in April. Like the manufacturer's Nitro Deck handheld controller (more on that below), the Neo S aims to be a useful controller <em>and </em>a collectible. Each CRKD controller can be registered on the app by tapping your smartphone against the the company's logo on the back of the controller. Considering CRKD's approach to controller releases, it's not surprising the Neo S already has some fairly unique and stylish designs, including a Famicom-inspired <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-NEO-Wireless-Collectible-Controller-Console/dp/B0CVY8TBBM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Gold controller</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-NEO-Wireless-Collectible-Controller-Console/dp/B0CVY28DWW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Junkyard" theme</a>, and a number of transparent shells, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-NEO-Wireless-Collectible-Controller-Console/dp/B0CVYBGYBB?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clear model</a> shown above.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the other Neo S controller themes go for $50 each, but you won't get the fret attachment.</p><hr><h2><strong>Nitro Deck Nintendo Switch Controller + Carrying Case Bundles</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408926-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408926" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408926-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408926"></a><figcaption>Nitro Deck and carrying case</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4408926-nitro-deck.jpg"></figure><p>Switch owners who want better ergonomics in handheld mode should also check out CKRD's Nitro Deck, one of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">favorite handheld controllers for the Nintendo Switch</a>.
