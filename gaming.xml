<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Pokemon Company has revealed <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>, the next set in the beloved TCG. This set will add a selection of new cards in August 2024, some of which were first seen in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs. </p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is set to add a bunch of new cards for competitive players to add to their decks and experiment with, as well as some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rarest-pokemon-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly desirable collectibles</a>. Perhaps most exciting of all, it’s going to add a new foil variant to shiny cards that are going to make foil pulls from packs even more exciting. All <em>Pokemon TCG</em> fans should be keeping an eye on this one because it’s going to really change the game when it drops. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-release-date-for-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable" data-injectable="false">When is the release date for <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><strong>The release date for the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is August 2, 2024.</strong> This is when retailers will be able to sell products from the set, though there could be prerelease events leading up to that date that will allow fans to get their hands on cards early, depending on what their local game stores offer. </p>
 <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="151" data-injectable="false">The only exception to this is the <strong><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> Booster Bundle, which will go on sale on September 6, 2024.</strong> </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set?</h2> <figure data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"><strong>The <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set will introduce brand new aspects to the TCG, including Pecharunt.</strong> This Pokemon was originally discovered in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs for <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, and it’s coming to the TCG as a Darkness-Type. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">Players will be able to use Pecharunt ex to let them switch in another Darkness-Type Pokemon that’s currently benched with its Subjugating Chains ability. It can also be paired with the Pokemon you’ll recognize from when you first encountered it, Okidogi ex, Munkidori ex, and Fezandipiti ex for various combos. </p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">What I think might be the most exciting part of this set is the fact that it adds another unique foil pattern. These will still be Parallel Foils, but they’ll feature a new foil style surrounding the artwork of the card. You can check if you get one of these using the expansion code in the bottom left-hand corner of the card. It should show an illustrated white box with black text if it’s one of these new variants from the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set. </p>

However, they’re not available to everyone, especially if you live out in the sticks like me. So, for those of you who need an online retailer, these are the best ones to use. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pokemon Center Online</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: The Pokemon Center Online is the most reliable retailer of <em>Pokemon TCG</em> products.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="467" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Learning the rules of how to play <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is all you need to do in order to have fun at most tables. But at some point in your journey as a Planeswalker, you may run into an opponent whose deck always has the upper hand against yours. This boils down to the balancing system within MTG, which, like many competitive games, is roughly based on a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” system. The concept is easy to follow, but it isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> there are numerous <strong>deck archetypes</strong> that represent our rock, paper, and scissors. At the core of MTG (and other card and video games), there are three primary archetypes: Aggro, Control, and Combo. This guide will go over these three archetypes and the Keyword Abilities that contribute to their success. By the end, you’ll be able to identify the archetype of any given deck, along with its strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-three-core-deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg" data-injectable="false">The three core deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Aggro</strong> (Aggressive) deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Starting with one of the easiest-to-understand archetypes, Aggro decks are everything that you think of when you hear “aggressive.” The strategy is to be in your opponent’s face, hitting hard and fast. To do this, Aggro decks primarily contain cards of the <strong>Red</strong> mana color due to its cheap creatures and<strong> Burn</strong> spells (such as Lightning Bolt) which are capable of dealing raw damage to any target.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Some abilities that thrive in Aggro decks are <strong>Haste</strong>, <strong>Prowess</strong>, and <strong>Trample</strong>. These abilities allow creatures to dish out damage quickly and efficiently. Remember, the goal of an Aggro deck is to be fast and overwhelm your opponents before they have a chance to establish themselves. You’ll be looking to swing (attack) with all of your creatures in every combat phase, if possible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="924" data-injectable="true">Although most Aggro decks in MTG use Red cards, that isn’t to say that other colors can’t be used to build aggressive decks. One of the weaknesses of Red cards is the lack of removal and denial options. Pairing Red with colors that cover its shortcomings, such as Black or Blue, will make for a slightly less aggressive but more well-rounded deck. The popular <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-color-combination-names-explained/">Gruul Aggro combination</a> uses Red cards to establish an early board advantage and then uses enchants and +1/+1 counters from <strong>Green</strong> cards to form a powerful mid-game roster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">If you can’t defeat your opponent quickly enough, your army of small creatures won’t be able to stand up against the fearsome monstrosities built by<strong> Ramp</strong> decks or the various gimmicks that <strong>Combo</strong> decks employ.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Combo</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Combo decks are the paper to Aggro decks’ rock, but that metaphor doesn’t paint the whole picture. Your strategy becomes a matter of putting together the pieces of a puzzle. Reliably drawing those pieces and defending your work in progress are the keys to being a successful Combo player. This is why Combo archetypes in MTG perform so well against Aggro strategies; There isn’t a fear of a Counterspell or Exile card awaiting your grand finale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Each Combo deck has an overall win condition, with most having a few lesser combos included. While there isn’t a particular color that is overrepresented in Combo decks, there are many boxes that need to be checked to succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Combo decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Tutor </strong>cards allow you to search your library for specific card types.</li> <li>Spells or permanents with <strong>Hexproof</strong>, <strong>Indestructible</strong>, or <strong>Ward</strong>, which effectively increases the cost to target a permanent with spells or abilities.</li> <li>Triggers or abilities such as “enter the battlefield (ETB)” or “Whenever you…” provide a focus for the deck to be built around.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">An example of a win condition for a Combo deck would be <strong>Revel in Riches</strong>. By utilizing the <strong>Pirates</strong> tribe and their various means of <strong>Treasure</strong> generation or cards such as <strong>Brass’s Bounty</strong>, victory is easily attainable.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">With an ideal starting hand, Combo decks easily spiral out of control and become a dominant force at the table– or simply win the game. But as we mentioned at the beginning of this guide, this concept is only simple on paper. While Combo strategies excel against Aggro decks, they fall victim to the disruption that <strong>Control </strong>archetypes specialize in. A simple Counterspell or various forms of removal could put a stop to a Combo deck before it has the chance to get the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Control</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">With a Control deck, you’re disrupting the opponents’ strategy in every way that you can. This is done with <strong>Counterspells</strong>, forms of removal such as <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards, or advanced strategies such as <strong>Mill</strong> or <strong>Discard</strong>. It’s because of these tools that Combo decks fear going up against Control decks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Colors that are synonymous with Control decks are Blue, White, and Black. Each of these colors provides the means to put a stop to any deck strategy out there– so long as you have the cards in hand and mana to spare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="62" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Control decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Scry</strong> and <strong>Surveil</strong> cards along with sources of card <strong>Draw</strong> in order to keep a healthy amount of solutions in your hand to address any issues that arise.</li> <li>Removal cards range from soft-removal options such as <strong>Bounce</strong> (return target permanent to its owner’s hand) to hard-removal in the form of <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards.</li> <li>Abilities that effectively increase the number of spells at your disposal. These would be Flashback or Magecraft spells or any card that allows you to “return Instant or Sorcery cards from your graveyard.”&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">But while Control decks seem to have all of the solutions for dealing with other deck archetypes, they struggle to close out games on their own. Control decks are notorious for running very few creatures, which greatly limits their offensive capabilities and makes defending those creatures a necessary task for victory. Many Control players resort to unconventional win conditions such as<strong> Laboratory Maniac</strong> or the various <strong>Jace Planeswalkers</strong> and their card drawing and milling mechanics.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Control decks can easily dismantle the strategies of Combo decks but struggle to keep up with the output of creatures and spells cast by Aggro players. Players of Control decks will frequently lose mana advantage to Aggro players due to the cost differences between the two. Eventually, Control players will run out of answers to Aggro players’ numerous questions, and defeat becomes inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Other deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Aggro, Combo, and Control archetypes are the foundation of many decks within MTG. There are a vast number of strategies that build off of one or a combination of multiple archetypes to create a unique playstyle. Archetypes such as <strong>Tempo</strong> or <strong>Midrange</strong> fuse the strategies of Aggro and Control decks but deploy them at opposing stages of the game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Wizards of the Coast continues to expand the number of archetypes that exist in the game by<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/"> introducing new abilities with every set</a>. But at its core, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will forever be one of the most captivating games of Rock, Paper, Scissors ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modern Warfare 3 (2011) was the ultimate ending to one of the greatest trilogies in the history of the franchise. It was a monumental run from start to finish, taking players from COD 4: Modern Warfare in 2007 to the grand finale in 2011’s MW3. In the middle, we were blessed to receive Modern Warfare 2, widely considered to be the best Call of Duty game ever (perhaps behind Black Ops).</p>



<p>Now, thirteen years after Modern Warfare 3 was released, a cut post-credits scene has emerged online, showcasing a subtle change that brings about a massively different ending for the 2011 game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-but-mighty">Small but Mighty</h2>



<p>At the end of Modern Warfare 3, Captain Price finally thwarts Vladimir Makarov, securing justice in the most poetic (and brutal) way possible. As he sits back and marvels at his work, he pulls out his trademark cigar, lights up, and then the screen fades to black, with the game simply drifting away, marking an end to the trilogy.</p>



<p>However, in the new clip that has surfaced online – which is a total of 60 seconds long – we see the same sequence unfold, but there are a couple of minor differences.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MW3 Cut Post-Credits Scene (4K)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/De7Axarv12E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Across the room, we see a shadowy, suited figure appear, which many have claimed is a representation of Death. His identity is never confirmed as he looks at the scene before him and walks off, with Captain Price losing grip of his cigar and having it roll to the floor, before again, the game fades into darkness. We then see a picture of the four key characters we followed through the trilogy, which is a nod to the fact that they’ve all met their untimely end.</p>



<p>Only Infinity Ward knows the identity of this figure, as the content was ultimately cut from the game and never saw the light of day – until now.</p>

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">“In from the Cold” is a level 83 MSQ quest in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, which involves you playing not as yourself but as an Unknown Imperial who needs to get back to Camp Broken Glass within a specified time limit. It’s a challenging quest but also incredibly memorable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">To complete “In from the Cold”, you’ll need to make your way back to Camp Broken Glass very slowly, navigating the unfamiliar Garlean streets while trying to avoid as much conflict as possible. I’d recommend setting aside roughly 45 minutes to an hour to complete this quest.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">You do not, by default, have any health regeneration during this quest, although you can rarely find potions that grant a five-minute regeneration buff. You can also find Med Kits, which will restore 35% of the Unknown Imperial’s maximum HP, but you can only carry a certain number of these at any one time. Both of these items can be found by interacting with the many clickable elements encountered during the quest.</p>
 <h2 id="h-getting-to-know-the-unknown-imperial" data-injectable="false">Getting to know the Unknown Imperial</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">After you’re transported into the body of the Unknown Imperial, you’ll lose all of your regular abilities and have to quickly get acquainted with some new ones. For those who regularly play as a Tank Job, particularly Paladin, these will be familiar:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Fight or Flight:</strong> <ul> <li>Increases weapon damage by 25% for 25 seconds. Has a 60-second cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Fast Blade:</strong> <ul> <li>A sword weapon skill that executes an attack at 200 potency.&nbsp;</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Riot Blade:&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>Deals damage to a single target with 170 potency, increasing to 300 potency when used after Fast Blade.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rage of Halone:</strong> <ul> <li>Paladin Job skill which delivers an attack with 100 potency, increasing to 330 potency when used after Riot Blade.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rampart:</strong> <ul> <li>Reduces incoming damage by 10% for 20 seconds. Has a 90-second cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="h-surviving-your-first-enemy-encounter" data-injectable="false">Surviving your first enemy encounter</h2> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">To begin with, you’ll only have a time limit of 25 minutes to reach Camp Broken Glass, although this will change as you progress through the quest. While you should avoid as much conflict as you can during this quest, some enemies need to be fought, and the first one is just ahead and to the East.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">The most challenging part of this first fight is the fact that you don’t regenerate health, so the biggest piece of advice I can give is to avoid any telegraphed attacks and make sure you use Fight or Flight and Rampart whenever they’re available.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve defeated this soldier, interact with his corpse to find a Med Kit and use it to restore some of the health you lost during the fight, then interact with it again to pay your respects.</p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">After this encounter, you’ll be warned that in order to survive, you’ll need to avoid any unwanted attention. With this in mind, you now need to find a way out of the first area you find yourself in.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-get-the-magitek-reaper-in-working-order" data-injectable="false">Get the Magitek Reaper in working order</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">Head South and interact with the Immobilized Magitek Reaper (X:23.6, Y:16.9). Doing this will allow you to progress by unlocking the next two things you need to do. While you’re in the area, make sure to interact with the Wrecked Magitek Reaper (X:25.4, Y:16.5) to loot a Med Kit.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">Next, head to one of the buildings to the West of the Immobilized Magitek Reaper and interact with him. He’ll give you the identification key required to use the Immobilized Magitek Reaper, but you’ll need some fuel if you’re hoping to get it working again.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">To find the fuel, in the form of a Ceruleum Tank, head to the East and find the Fuel-concealing Wreckage (X:27.4, Y:13.4). Interacting with this wreckage will provide you with a Ceruleum Tank, but this poses a problem – you’ll enter into Transporting mode and, while carrying the Tank, you’ll be unable to use any of the Unknown Imperial’s abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">If you take any damage while Transporting the Tank, you will drop it and have to defeat the threat. Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to pick it up again and continue onwards towards the Magitek Reaper. Interact with it while holding the Ceruleum Tank, and you’ll now have a fully operational Reaper.</p> <h2 id="h-use-the-repaired-magitek-reaper-to-clear-the-way-forwards" data-injectable="false">Use the repaired Magitek Reaper to clear the way forwards</h2> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Now that you can use the Reaper to assist you in your journey back to Camp Broken Glass, you’ll have three new abilities to become familiar with, all of which do 5,000 damage each and are enough to one-shot each of the enemies you’ll encounter during the coming sequence:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>Ground-target AoE with a short cast time and no cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Diffractive Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>Line-attack AoE, which has a short cast time and a short cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>High-power Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>A much larger AoE variation of Magitek Cannon, which has a short cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">There will be multiple mobs of Magitek units which need to be defeated. Some of these will come in waves, meaning you’ll need to pay attention and adjust yourself accordingly:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Large mobs of units to the West, in front of the curtain of light blocking your way. Any attack is appropriate to take these out pretty efficiently.</li> <li>Mobs of 5-7 Magitek Slasher units in the center of the area. Use Magitek Cannon to focus an attack to take them down.</li> <li>Magitek Vanguards which spawn and use telegraphed abilities, which need to be avoided before taking out the Vanguards. The larger, High-power Magitek Cannon is perfect to defeat these.</li> <li>Magitek Death Claws will slowly approach in a line. Use Diffractive Magitek Cannon to take out the line in one shot.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve defeated all of the different waves of enemies, you’ll be able to dismount the Magitek Reaper and make your way past the now-disappeared curtain of light. Once you’re through, two Tempered Imperial Soldiers will appear, but these can be avoided pretty easily by simply walking behind them to avoid drawing attention to yourself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">Make your way South and then West, moving under the broken segments where a bridge used to be, to get to the next challenge.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-protect-the-imperial-citizens" data-injectable="false">Protect the Imperial Citizens</h2> <figure data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">There’s a lot of local wildlife in the next area who are attacking some Imperial Citizens. You’ll need to defeat these creatures while continuing your journey North West. Thankfully, you’re unlikely to draw any aggro from these creatures as they’re pretty focused on their original targets, so you can take them out pretty easily.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">The types of enemies you’ll need to defeat are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"> <li>Morozko</li> <li>Ceruleum Zoblyn</li> <li>Almasty</li> <li>Eblan Bear</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">While you can fight these creatures in any order, I’d recommend taking out the bigger ones first, as they’re likely to do more damage to the people you’re trying to protect. You’ll also be helped by some other civilians.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">After defeating the creatures and heading further North, you’ll encounter some more enemies. This time, you’ll have to defeat some Corrupted and Transformed Imperial Soldiers. The best method to do this is by focusing your attention on the Transformed Imperial Soldiers, because the civilians with you have entered a Magitek Reaper to take on the Corrupted Soldier.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">At some point during this battle, the Corrupted Imperial will explode with a telegraphed AoE. You can avoid death by finding the safe spot behind the Magitek Reaper and sheltering there, but you won’t get out of this unscathed.</p> <h2 id="h-drag-yourself-to-safety" data-injectable="false">Drag yourself to safety&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">The blast from the Corrupted Soldier will render you unconscious for a short while, with the screen going black. Don’t worry, you haven’t failed, this was supposed to happen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">When you wake up, you’ll immediately be thrown into an Active Time Event. During this, you’ll need to quickly and repeatedly press any button you have at your disposal in order to remain conscious and drag yourself away from the battle. You start off going very slowly as you’re weighed down with debuffs, but as these drop off you do pick up some speed. Thankfully, you don’t have to do this for the entire distance to Camp Broken Glass, just to the end of the street. This can take roughly ten seconds, so avoid hand cramps by alternating hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed the Active Time Event, a cutscene will play and then you’ll wake up in your own body, free to talk to Alisaie in order to complete “In from the Cold”.</p>

			<p>Chinese developer Game Science has published a short but sweet new trailer for its debut action RPG title, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>As you might remember, the game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in August 2020 with a gorgeous video that showcased 13 minutes of gameplay. However, at that time, Game Science admitted there was still a lot of work to do, and the video was meant more as a recruiting tool than anything else.</p>
<p>In early 2021, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-new-trailer-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the team was targeting a 2023 release window. At Gamescom 2021, Game Science <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-unreal-engine-5-ray-tracing-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> Black Myth: Wukong was being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Eventually, the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-is-the-first-2023-game-to-be-delayed-to-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> their debut title to 2024, and we now know the game is set to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-august-20-launch-date-and-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 20</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support</a> NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 (including Ray Reconstruction) and full path tracing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - WeGame Tonight 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpH2sUkdRE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by Journey to the West, the Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en. It is considered one of the greatest Classic Chinese Novels and may even be the most popular Asian novel of all time.</p>
<p>As the Destined One, players will roam through a land steeped in mythology, encountering various powerful foes. Players will also master various staff techniques and freely combine different spells, abilities, weapons, and equipment to find the winning strategy that best suits their combat style.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since Ubisoft released the original <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, there has been a plethora of special editions of every entry. As a fan who adores the franchise, I find it pretty expensive to pick up all the editions, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is no exception. </p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">When <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-carves-a-bloody-path-through-feudal-japan-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft revealed <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, it was ready to go with all of the game’s special editions. Within minutes, you could find every digital edition and start seeking out the physical ones if you knew where to look. Unfortunately, Ubisoft has a habit of making exclusive deals with specific retailers, meaning you need to buy a few copies of the game if you want to collect every edition. </p>
 <h2 id="h-every-edition-of-assassin-s-creed-shadows-and-where-to-buy-them" data-injectable="false">Every edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and where to buy them</h2> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Below, I’ve listed all the editions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> you can buy and where you can get them. I’ll keep the list up to date as new retailers pop up because products like the Collector’s Edition can come to certain regions, such as the UK, pretty late. Note that all editions are available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S except the Collector’s Edition, which has no Xbox version. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Standard Edition (physical &amp; digital)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">The Standard Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is the base game and nothing more. While looking around, I couldn’t even see any pre-order bonuses for this edition. That might even be to its detriment because most retailers selling a physical copy of the game are selling a more premium version. The only exception is GameStop in the US, which charges the same price for the box with no bonuses.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">This is the edition to get if you’re not bothered by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-locking-dlc-behind-season-passes-isnt-anything-new-but-it-still-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extra quests locked behind pre-orders or season passes</a>. The issue is, you’ll be spending as much on this version of the game as you will one that comes with a free steelbook. However, if you have a digital-only console, it’s the cheapest version available to you at $69.99/£69.99 on all digital storefronts.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Standard Edition with Free Steelbook (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Game Collection</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">One of the best physical editions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ Standard Edition is available with a free steelbook case. It costs about the same as the digital-only Standard Edition once you take shipping into account, but you get a shiny steelbook to add to your collection. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This isn’t something I’d usually go in for because you get the steelbook with the Collector’s Edition, though this one appears to be a retailer exclusive. However, if you don’t want to spend that much, this will cost you £56.95 from <a href="https://www.thegamecollection.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Collection</a> in the UK. I can’t find a listing in the US, but I’ve seen that this sort of exclusive deal is traditionally something <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> would do.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Special Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Strangely, the Special Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is cheaper than the Standard Edition, but you will need to take shipping into account, which could round it back up. However, I’d say it’s worth the price because not only do you get the physical boxed copy, but you also get the pre-order bonus quest, Thrown to the Dogs, and the Yasuke Sekiryu Character Pack. This pack contains an exclusive gear set, mount, trinket, and weapon. </p>
 <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="202" data-injectable="false">This edition is exclusive to <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GAME</a> in the UK and costs £64.99. I can’t find a US listing for it, but you can also get the bonuses from this edition in the Ultimate and Collector’s Editions. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Limited Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Limited Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is Amazon’s exclusive version of the game. It contains everything the Special Edition does, except its Sekiryu Character Pack is for Naoe, not Yasuke. As with the Special Edition, this character pack is also available in the Ultimate and Collector’s Editions, but not the box that says “Limited Edition” on it, which is what you’re really buying this edition for. </p>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">The Limited Edition costs $69.99/£64.99 and is widely available on your regional version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>. It is probably the best value-for-money pick on the list. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Gold Edition (physical &amp; digital)</h3> <figure data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">The Gold Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is where things start to get interesting. It packs in the base game, the pre-order bonus quest, three days of early access, and the game’s season pass. That season pass entitles you to two upcoming expansions and another exclusive mission. </p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">This edition is available on all digital storefronts for $109.99/£94.99. You can also purchase a physical version of the Gold Edition from GAME in the UK or Amazon worldwide for roughly $5/£5 less, but you’ll need to factor in shipping. As with the other physical editions, I’d say this one is worth getting a boxed copy of for the case and accompanying DLC notes. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Ultimate Edition (digital-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">This is the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game I’ve seen in a long time without a physical version of the Ultimate Edition you can buy separately. While it’s digital-only and will cost you $114.99/$129.99 on all digital storefronts, it’s got a lot of content in it.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">The Ultimate Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> contains the base game, the pre-order bonus quest, season pass, three days of early access, and the Ultimate Pack. This pack contains the Sekiryu Character Pack for both Yasuke and Naoe mentioned in other editions, as well as the Red Dragon filter for Photo Mode and five additional character skill points. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Collector’s Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The Collector’s Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is a thing of beauty. It includes everything in the Ultimate Edition. In fact, it’s the only way to get a boxed version of that edition, as well as a host of physical goodies. These are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Ultimate Edition physical case</li> <li>Collector’s Edition steelbook (different from the TGC one)</li> <li>Naoe’s Katana Tsuba</li> <li>Replica World Map</li> <li>Collector’s World Map</li> <li>Creed Wall Scroll</li> <li>2 Sumi Lithographs</li> <li>Naoe &amp; Yasuke Statue</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">This edition is the most expensive of them all, costing £239.99 from UK retailer GAME and $279.99 from <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">GameSto</a><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p</a> in the US. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What do you need to buy to own everything for<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">You need to buy the following editions to own everything you can possibly get for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, both in-game and physical collector’s items. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> with TGC Exclusive Free Steelbook</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Special Edition</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Limited Edition</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Gold Edition (physical)</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Collector’s Edition</li> </ul> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="false">If you want to save some money, you could wait until after the game’s release, early 2025, to pick up the cheaper physical editions at a discount. I don’t see them retaining their value, but the Collector’s Editions always do. It’s worth remembering that for the Special Edition, Limited Edition, and Gold Editions, you’re only after the cases, so you can buy very used copies to complete your set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-rings-new-enemy-is-becoming-players-new-obsession/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-rings-new-enemy-is-becoming-players-new-obsession<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">FromSoftware has revealed one of the new foes players will meet in <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC. While it’s currently unknown if this character is a boss or a regular enemy, fans are already hard at work trying to figure out what or who they may be.</p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">The latest in what fans know to be a<em> </em>very long line of unsettling <em>Elden Ring</em> enemies was revealed to us in a post on FromSoftware’s official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1791468858106069215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em> X/Twitter</a> account. The enemy, partially obscured by a cloak of ominous shadows, leaves quite the first impression. With its lifeless grey skin, wicked twin crescent blades, and cracked golden mask, this enemy looks like it stepped straight out of a nightmare just to cut you to ribbons.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">Within minutes of this absolute nightmare’s grand unveiling, the <em>Elden Ring</em> fandom came together to speculate over what, or who, it could be. <em>Elden Ring</em> loves to hide hints about its character’s origins and alignment within their designs, and players were quick to form theories about this masked ghoul.</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-elden-ring-enemy-may-be-an-omen-of-things-to-come-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree" data-injectable="false">New Elden Ring enemy may be an omen of things to come in Shadow of the Erdtree</h2> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">One of the most popular theories is that this enemy is related to the Omens, bloated, axe-wielding giants who pop up in several areas of the Lands Between. In addition to their massive size, Omens are known for the gigantic horns sprouting from their heads, which look <em>very </em>similar to the ones featured in the new enemy’s rent mask. Coincidences don’t happen often in <em>Elden Ring’s </em>visual design, so this new opponent is likely connected to the Omens somehow.</p>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Fans were also quick to notice another interesting detail: this new enemy is female, or at the very least, has feminine features. X user SweetPeachGames noted<a href="https://twitter.com/SweetPeachGames/status/1791469391336427744"> in this post</a> that the enemy’s feet were distinctly feminine, with smaller toes and a curved instep. </p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Other users noticed that the creature casts a distinctly uterine silhouette. Motherhood, blood ties, and birth are significant themes in <em>Elden Ring</em>, so I’d feel safe betting that this was an intentional decision by the designers.</p>
 <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Visions of dancer <a href="https://t.co/Mm7Dup4LBd">pic.twitter.com/Mm7Dup4LBd</a></p>— Syrobe (@SyrobeNA) <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrobeNA/status/1791565173473624117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">Another unsettling detail about this creature is that it’s <em>much taller </em>than it initially appears. By brightening the image, players discovered that the enemy has a hunched back, which means it will likely raise itself to its full height when players encounter it. This revelation drew X user <a href="https://x.com/SyrobeNA/status/1791565173473624117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Syrobe</a> to compare the new enemy and <em>Dark Souls III’</em>s Dancer of the Boreal Valley.</p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="false"><em>Elden Ring Shadows of the Erdtree</em> is coming out on June 21, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/complete-guide-to-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=complete-guide-to-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whether you’re looking to level up in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> or hoping to get your hands on some exclusive items, you shouldn’t overlook Wondrous Tails. It can seem pretty confusing at first, but once you’re used to it, it’s a quick and easy thing to tick off your weekly checklist.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Wondrous Tails is a combination of incentive to run duties you might not have run for a while, and also a game of luck. For each successfully completed duty, you earn a stamp on a grid and if you’re lucky enough to get four stamps in a line, you get more worthwhile rewards. Completing nine duties guarantees you at least 50% of a level. That’s the TLDR; now let’s get into the details.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to unlock Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="83" data-current-count="83" data-injectable="false">Before you can unlock Wondrous Tails, you’ll need to have met a few requirements:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false"> <li>Have access to Idyllshire, which unlocks during the MSQ at level 58</li> <li>Be at least level 60 in any Disciple of War or Magic Job</li> </ul> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">If you’ve met these requirements, head to Idyllshire and pick up the quest called “Keeping Up with the Aliapohs” from the Unctuous Adventurer (X:7.0, Y:5.9). It’s a pretty easy quest; all you need to do is introduce yourself to Khloe Aliapoh. She’s a young Mi’qote who wants to hear all about your adventures, providing you with a journal to complete each week.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Khloe can be found in the same booth as the Faux Commander, so while you’re here, you may as well unlock <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/complete-faux-hollows-ffxiv-guide-how-to-unlock-unreal-trials-and-rewards/">Faux Hollows</a> while you’re here.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-play-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to play Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Each week, after the weekly reset happens, you can head to Idyllshire and pick up a new journal from Khloe (X:5.7, Y:6.1), which will then be stored within the Key Items tab of your inventory. Inside, there are two pages. The left page is the list of duties you can complete to earn seals, and the right side is the grid where these seals will be placed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">You can either complete nine individual listed duties to earn your seals or use your Second Chances to re-run the same duty repeatedly. Each time you complete a listed duty, you’ll earn a seal which will be randomly placed on the grid on the right side page of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The very good news is that, as long as the duty is not from the current expansion, you can run any of the duties unsynced. This is especially useful for low level content, such as the level 50 Extreme Trials, allowing you to get seals very quickly. I won’t go into too much detail about the duties that can be included, but the duties always include the following to choose from:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"> <li>Three Dungeons of any level</li> <li>One level 90 Dungeon</li> <li>Two level 50 Extreme Trials</li> <li>Two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-every-alliance-raid-ffxiv/">Alliance Raids</a></li> <li>Three <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Normal Raids</a></li> <li>Five duties which can include any of the following types of content: <ul> <li>The Coils of Bahamut</li> <li>Extreme Raids at level 60 or above</li> <li>PvP</li> <li>Treasure Hunt</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-deep-dungeon-how-to-unlock-palace-of-the-dead/">Deep Dungeons</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed nine duties, you’ll be able to hand your journal back into Khloe and claim your prizes and EXP. You have two weeks to complete the nine duties, and if you run out of time, you’ll have to pick up a fresh journal.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-earn-and-use-second-chances-for-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to earn and use Second Chances for Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve unlocked Wondrous Tails, you’ll start to earn Second Chances. These are earned every time you complete any duty within the game if one or more members of the party are new to the duty. You don’t need to currently possess a journal in order to earn second chances and you can have a maximum of nine Second Chances at any one time.</p> <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Second Chances can be used for two things:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Action</strong></td><td><strong>Points needed</strong></td><td><strong>What it does</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Retry</td><td>1</td><td>Restores the status of a duty that has already been completed, allowing you to re-run it. Also removes one of the other duties.</td></tr><tr><td>Shuffle</td><td>2</td><td>When you have between 3 and 7 seals, you can use this to shuffle their positions on the grid.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking to complete a journal quickly, using Retry will allow you to re-run relatively low-level content, such as the level 50 extreme trials. As you need to complete nine duties to complete a journal and you have nine Second Chances, you can run the same content nine times.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Shuffle should be used if you’re having remarkably bad luck, as it might offer a chance to get three lines, which means you get the most worthwhile rewards when handing a journal back to Khloe. However, as this costs two points, you may need to run multiple different duties as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dead-by-daylight-chaos-shuffle-modifier-release-date-and-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Shuffle Modifier Event</a></em> in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> brings a brand new game mode for players to dive into that changes the rules in a massive way. Not only is it a nice change of pace, but you can earn some great rewards by completing its Event Tome challenges. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Many of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>‘s events have their own Event Tome, but <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> is something special. It’s a Modifer, meaning it’s an entirely new game mode with some big changes to the standard Trial formula that make it a bit more of a challenge to complete challenges in. However, if you know what you’re doing, you’ll find these challenges pretty easy to bash out in one afternoon. </p>
 <h2 id="h-all-chaos-shuffle-tome-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them-in-dead-by-daylight" data-injectable="false">All <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> Tome challenges and how to complete them in <em>Dead by Daylight</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">Below, I’ve listed every challenge in the <em>Dead by Daylight Chaos Shuffle</em> Event Tome, how to complete them, and the rewards you can unlock. The Event Tome is only available between May 16 to 23, 2024, so you’ll need to complete it quickly if you want to grab every reward on offer. Note that all of these challenges must be completed in the Chaos Shuffle Modifier playlist.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Silver Age</strong>: Earn 3 emblems of silver quality or better across multiple Trials as a Survivor and/or Killer. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Drop or Chop</strong>: Complete a total of 4 pallet drops while being chased by the Killer or 4 pallet breaks as a Killer across multiple Trials. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bloody Rewards</strong>: Earn 50,000 Bloodpoints as a Killer or Survivor. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: Champagne Flute Badge.</li> <li><strong>Golden Age</strong>: Earn 2 emblems of gold quality or better across multiple Trials as a Survivor and/or Killer. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Destroy or Rebuild</strong>: Complete a total of 4 generator skill checks or break generators 4 times across multiple Trials. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Cat or Mouse</strong>: Complete a total of 60 seconds of being chased by the Killer or chasing Survivors as the Killer across multiple Trials. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: Exquisite Lilac Banner.</li> <li><strong>Execution</strong>: Kill 3 Survivors by any means across multiple Trials. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Escape Artist</strong>: Escape 1 Trial. <ul> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments and 15,000 Bloodpoints.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Reward</strong>: Silky Sound Charm &amp; 25 Rift Fragments.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">These time-limited rewards are the best of the best for me because they won’t come around again. You can show them off forever, and everyone will wonder where they came from. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to play <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> in <em>Dead by Daylight</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">To make sure you’re playing <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, you need to select the <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> mode from the home screen. It enters you into separate queues to play, which helps keep the standard Trial queue free of players who may not know what Perks they’re running. </p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="false">Of course, that’s the twist with <em>Chaos Shuffle</em>. It chooses four random Perks for you, so you have no idea which Perks you’re using in the Trial. It keeps things very interesting because you can’t simply lean on your usual strategies. You need to play to win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-alhaitham-builds-in-genshin-impact/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-alhaitham-builds-in-genshin-impact<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="222" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Alhaitham is a 5-star Dendro DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em>. From his signature Light of Folar Incision to the budget-friendly Harbinger of Dawn, here are the best weapons and artifacts to make Alhaitham a formidable DPS.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-alhaitham" data-injectable="false">Best weapons for Alhaitham</h2> <h3 id="h-light-of-foliar-incision" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision</h3> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false"><strong>Light of Foliar Incision is Alhaitham’s signature 5-star Sword and his best-in-slot.</strong> However, its advantage over other 5-star weapons is fairly small. I only recommend pulling for this weapon if you don’t have any of the other 5-star Swords below and don’t want to use a 4-star option.</p> <h3 id="h-primordial-jade-cutter-uraku-misugiri" data-injectable="false">Primordial Jade Cutter / Uraku Misugiri</h3> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">These two 5-star Swords are almost as good as Alhaitham’s signature if you happen to have them already. They offer high CRIT stats and passives that are at least somewhat usable. Consider a Geo teammate if using Uraku Misugiri, particularly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mistsplitter-reforged-haran-geppaku-futsu-splendor-of-tranquil-waters" data-injectable="false">Mistsplitter Reforged / Haran Geppaku Futsu / Splendor of Tranquil Waters</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">These 5-star Swords perform fairly similarly. They each have desirable CRIT stats, and Alhaitham can generally make use of their passive effects. Splendor of Tranquil Waters requires an HP-draining teammate to trigger its passive consistently. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-furina-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furina</a> is currently the best teammate for this purpose.</p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-wolf-fang-the-black-sword" data-injectable="false">Wolf-Fang / The Black Sword</h3> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Both of the 4-star Swords from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-genshin-impact-battle-pass-weapons-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> are useful for Alhaitham. Wolf-Fang is the better of the two, especially with Refinements. At Refinement Rank 5, Wolf-Fang can perform better than some of the 5-stars above. This does, however, require you to buy the Battle Pass five times. You should weigh whether the $50 fixed cost is worth it for you.</p> <h3 id="h-toukabou-shigure-iron-sting" data-injectable="false">Toukabou Shigure / Iron Sting</h3> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Toukabou Shigure and Iron Sting are the free-to-play 4-star options. Despite being obtainable for free, they’re not bad at all. Toukabou Shigure was a past event weapon, but Iron Sting can still be crafted for free using billets. Iron Sting Refinements improve Alhaitham’s damage by a small amount; there’s no need to use precious billets on them unless you want to.</p>
 <h3 id="h-harbinger-of-dawn" data-injectable="false">Harbinger of Dawn</h3> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">Harbinger of Dawn is a 3-star Sword, but it still provides value with its hefty CRIT stat and useful passive effect. Harbinger of Dawn is only worth using if you can consistently keep Alhaitham above 90% HP. If you can keep the passive up, Harbinger of Dawn can perform better than the 4-star options above. However, this may not be feasible with Furina or in Bloom-based teams.</p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-artifact-sets-for-alhaitham" data-injectable="false">Best artifact sets for Alhaitham</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-gilded-dreams" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams</h3> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Gilded Dreams is Alhaitham’s best artifact set for his personal damage</strong>, assuming he has a teammate who can hold 4pc Deepwood Memories. This set gives a variable amount of Elemental Mastery and ATK, depending on his teammate composition. Luckily for Alhaitham, both of those stats are useful to him.</p> <h3 id="h-4pc-deepwood-memories" data-injectable="false">4pc Deepwood Memories</h3> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">If Alhaitham is the only Dendro character on the team, or if no one else can hold 4pc Deepwood Memories, then Alhaitham should hold it himself. Alhaitham needs the Dendro RES shred from the 4pc effect.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2pc-combos" data-injectable="false">2pc combos</h3> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false">While you’re still farming for a 4pc set, you can make do with 2pc combos with beneficial stat bonuses. Focus on sets that grant Elemental Mastery and ATK.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-alhaitham" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Alhaitham</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elemental Mastery<br>ATK</td><td data-align="center">Dendro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Alhaitham will need about 120-135% Energy Recharge to Burst every rotation, as long as he has a Dendro teammate to feed him energy. With Nahida or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a>, you can stay in the lower end of this range. With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-collei-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collei</a>, though, you may need more. I recommend putting a Favonius weapon on a teammate if possible.</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="false">As for other stats, Alhaitham should focus on <strong>CRIT stats, Elemental Mastery, and ATK</strong>, in that order of priority. Try to shoot for a 1:2 ratio of CRIT Rate to CRIT DMG.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Less than 18 months after it was first rolled out</a>, Tesla is allegedly pulling Steam support from its vehicles.</p>
<p>Back in December 2022, Tesla confirmed games like Cuphead, Sonic, and Cyberpunk 2077 could be played as part of a native beta Steam app in the company's S and X models.</p>

<p>Now, according to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/17/tesla-drops-steam-gaming-support-inside-vehicles/">Electrek</a>, the company is seemingly reversing that decision.</p>
<p>"Tesla is updating the gaming computer in your Model X, and your vehicle is no longer capable of playing Steam games," Tesla said in a brief statement sent to customers awaiting delivery of their S and X models (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tesla-is-dropping-steam-support-inside-its-new-cars/">VGC</a>). "All other entertainment and app functionalities are unaffected."</p>
<p>There's been no confirmation on why the functionality has been dropped, but it's thought existing Tesla owners already using the app are unaffected. 

</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-investigated-by-us-regulators-for-letting-drivers-play-games">Tesla was investigated by the US National Highways annd Traffic Safety Administration back in 2021</a> over its Passenger Play feature. Tesla responded by making Passenger Play "unusable" whilst the car is in motion, restricting Steam's functionality so it could only be used when the car was parked or being charged.</p>

<p data-characters="247" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The official <em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account has teased an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-is-teasing-a-fallout-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming <em>Fallout</em> collaboration</a>. By most accounts, more <em>Fallout</em> is a good thing, but for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a></em> players, it’s a bittersweet reminder of the battle royale mode their game lost years ago. </p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true"><em>Fortnite</em> has seen crossover events with a massive roster of huge franchises, including heavy-hitters like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Stranger Things</em>. Now, thanks in part, I’m sure, to the success of Amazon’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallouts-tv-debut-is-a-hit-but-it-doesnt-guarantee-an-elder-scrolls-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout TV Show</a></em>, the game is getting a <em>Fallout</em> crossover that will undoubtedly see new mechanics based on the <em>Fallout</em> universe introduced to <em>Fortnite</em> for a few weeks alongside skins players must earn during that season if they want to keep them forever. </p>
 <h2 id="h-fallout-in-fortnite-isn-t-what-fallout-76-players-want" data-injectable="false">Fallout in Fortnite isn’t what Fallout 76 players want</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><em>Fallout</em> skins in <em>Fortnite</em> aren’t what all <em>Fallout</em> fans want, though. You see, <em>Fallout 76</em> had a battle royale mode once called <em>Nuclear Winter</em>. When it was initially released, I remember it feeling fairly out of place because the premise was pretty weak, but the gameplay, rewards, and lore were engrossing. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">At the time of writing, others who remember and played the game mode, and even those who jumped into the game after it was closed and have only seen screenshots or videos of it, are lightly lamenting its loss and wondering if there’s any space for it to return. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Creator <a href="https://x.com/LyleShnub/status/1791936399790239860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frederick on Twitter</a> points out the fun and flaws of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s <em>Nuclear Winter</em>. “It was a weird and unique experiment that re-invented the way you thought about the game’s systems and world. It was also bad, lol.” </p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">I can’t deny that this game mode was bad, but not for the reasons you might think. As it does for most franchises, Battle Royale works for <em>Fallout</em>, but Nuclear Winter didn’t work for <em>Fallout 76</em> because it was implemented very quickly. It felt very much like Bethesda saw <em>Fortnite</em>‘s success, decided it wanted a piece of it, and threw out a battle royale mode for its online <em>Fallout</em> game. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false"><em>Fallout 76</em> uses card-based Perks that you unlock more of as you level up your character. <em>Nuclear Winter</em> broke this system and contained many weapons that broke it even further. Mercifully, weapons and Perks from the game mode became locked to it, so you couldn’t level up a character in the battle royale mode and then dominate public survival servers. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The rewards I loved the most were Holotapes. It’s difficult to know how many of these there were, but I believe there were dozens scattered around the Vault that acted as the lobby for the 52-player game mode. As you leveled up, you could access more rooms and find more Holotapes, telling the story of a supercomputer called ZAX. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">The computer was left in charge of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-known-fallout-vaults-canon-to-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault 51</a> to create fictional scenarios and test humanity’s tribalism to its limits. By the end of the experiment, it had only succeeded in forcing Vault Dwellers to split and war with each other. Learning about this in <em>Fallout 76</em> was fascinating and a real treat while <em>Nuclear Winter</em> was live. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="false">Perhaps because of this division of progression, <em>Nuclear Winter</em>‘s player base dwindled fairly quickly until Bethesda deemed it necessary to shut the game mode down entirely in 2021. Some players in <em>Fallout 76</em> still have rewards from the game mode on their save files today as a memory of what was a brief and tumultuous time for the game. </p>

            <p>Capcom is once again remaking Resident Evil 1.</p>
<p>That's according to noted horror genre leaker Dusk Golem and survival horror YouTuber Biohazard Declassified, both of whom have stepped up this weekend with rumours that Capcom is looking to breathe new life into the game that started it all, the very first Resident Evil.</p>

<p>Biohazard Declassified says they received an anonymous email that claims the game – with the working title, Biohazard: Resident Evil 1 – will be slower paced than RE2 Remake, feature a "different this person camera", and explore RE1's lore "further".</p>
<p>It's also alleged that each Zombie will have their own unique model due to the small number of enemies within the game, "bullet sponge" enemies, and see the return of Crimson Heads.</p> <div>

<p>Furthermore, there will be "no more pre-rendered backgrounds"; "each room will load up background assets and the rest of the assets will load when doors are opened. This is to improve visuals and lighting".</p>
<p>Golem took to social media on Sunday to substantiate the rumour.</p>
<p>"I can confirm that a new remake of Resident Evil 1 is in production and is scheduled to be released during the franchise's 30th anniversary in 2026," Golem said on X/Twitter.</p>
<blockquote data-context="false" data-id="wpBA2ey" lang="en"><a href="https://imgur.com/wpBA2ey"></a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"Some of the information circulating is true, such as the fact that it will be in third person. If I had to guess the same, it would probably be Resident Evil 1."</p>
<p>Whilst Golem has been correct about some early leaks – most notably those concerning Silent Hill 2 Remake, Alone in the Dark, and Resident Evil: Village – their record is not quite pristine, so this can only be taken as a rumour with a giant bucket of cautionary salt for now.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Golem made similar claims earlier this month, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-should-be-revealed-pretty-soon-and-release-next-year-leaker-suggests">Resident Evil 9 "should be revealed pretty soon and release next year"</a>.</p>
<p>"I have good news/rumours to deliver on Resident Evil 9," Dusk tweeted at the time. "The possible delay I had heard murmurs about can be pushed aside. [Resident Evil 9] should be revealed pretty soon and release next year. If what I heard previously holds true, should be in January. It'll have had about seven years in [development]."</p>

  <p id="uT4ygz">Netflix’s new animated movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24130971/thelma-the-unicorn-trailer-netflix-napoleon-dynamite"><em>Thelma the Unicorn</em></a> is full of soulful rock music, but one number stands out like a neon-colored sore thumb: “Here Comes the Cud.” And that’s deliberate. Flight of the Conchords’ Bret McKenzie designed “Here Comes the Cud” to be as disgustingly catchy and synthetic as possible. Creating a viral sensation — or at least, a number that could pass for a viral sensation within a movie’s fictional world — is a tall order. <em>Thelma</em> directors Jared Hess (<em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>) and Lynn Wang (Cartoon Network’s <a href="https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/unikitty/index.html"><em>UniKitty! </em>series</a>) talked to Polygon about how they conceived and planned it.</p>
<p id="Aa4X3A">As pony-masquerading-as-a-unicorn Thelma (Brittany Howard) chases fame, her manager Vic Diamond (McKenzie’s Flight of the Conchords partner Jemaine Clement) sets her up with super-popular social-media influencer Danny Stallion (Fred Armisen), whose whole schtick is regurgitating cud for his followers. </p>
<p id="yesp8g">Wang says the filmmakers looked to real-world online behavior to shape the character. “Danny was kind of just an amalgamation of all kinds of over-the-top influencers,” she says.</p>

<p id="xaJOdR">Thelma and Danny pretend to have a relationship for the PR value, just to whip up some intrigue and romance for their followers, and Vic decides they should collaborate on a song. At first, Thelma is eager, presenting a binder of songs close to the powerful rock ballads she sings in the beginning of the movie. But Vic says superstars don’t write their own songs: “The Algorithm” does it for them. </p>
<p id="KoQxNs">He puts a request into a machine called “Bridget,” and it spits out “Here Comes the Cud,” a song with a catchy-yet-soulless beat, simplistic lyrics, and an over-the-top music video set on a yacht. It’s incredibly catchy, yet its lyrics are about hacking up partially digested food, and it’s punctuated by burps and other bodily noises. It’s a far cry from the emotional, more personal songs Thelma belts out in a barn at the beginning of the movie. For Flight of the Conchords fans, its straight-faced humor, synthy music, and rap rhythms will also sound distinctly familiar.</p>

<p id="RXXNCk">“We had to establish Thelma’s brand of music and what kind of music was true to her that came out of her naturally, and then show how it gets corrupted by fame and stardom,” Hess says. “So it was fun to be able to show that contrast. Once it gets to ‘Here Comes the Cud,’ it all goes downhill.”</p>
<p id="Pw6RFA">The difference between the music Thelma writes for herself and the music the top stars in the world makes was very clearly defined. Wang and Hess collaborated with the movie’s songwriters and music producers to map out how that dynamic played into Thelma’s arc. </p>
<p id="uwSbS6">“<a href="https://www.taurastinson.com/">Taura Stinson</a>, Bret McKenzie, and all our songwriters really understood Thelma’s journey and what really needed to go into all of the lyrics to really help boost that emotional journey of hers,” says Wang. “But also making it really fun at the same time. Bret really brought the humor. It was really great.”</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Mountain Dew and gamers are one of those combinations that makes too much sense. It’s like peanut butter and jelly, or peanut butter and chocolate. This citrus-flavored concoction was incrementally developed by several individuals before PepsiCo acquired the rights. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">The taste, and combination of high-fructose corn syrup and caffeine, made it a hit with gamers who used it to fuel extended gaming sessions. PepsiCo, recognizing this, has made sure to promote the radioactive green drink with several games over the years.</p>  <figure data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h3 id="h-2004-the-mountain-dew-xbox" data-injectable="false">2004 – The Mountain Dew Xbox</h3> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">20 years ago, Microsoft and Mountain Dew came together in an unholy union to create the Limited Edition Mountain Dew Xbox. During the promotion, folks would need to accrue 550 points through Mountain Dew to unlock the option of purchasing the console for $100. While the total number of consoles produced is unknown, there’s an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MountainDewXbox/">active subreddit</a> trying to track down each one.</p> <h3 id="h-2005-every10minutes" data-injectable="false">2005 – Every10Minutes</h3> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Continuing its partnership with Microsoft, Mountain Dew launched the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051003215805/http://pepsi.yahoo.com/everyten/home.php">Every10Minutes promotion</a>. Participants would earn points by purchasing PepsiCo products which would then be tied to an account on the official site. Then, every 10 minutes (hence the name), they could use those points to bid on the then-unreleased Xbox 360.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2006-g4" data-injectable="false">2006 – G4</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Leaning more into the Mountain Dew Game Fuel branding, PepsiCo teamed up with DirecTV and G4 for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061018000351/http://www.championshipgamingseries.com/">Championship Gaming Invitational</a>. Additionally, participants in the event could win Mountain Dew’s “<a href="https://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video11359">Wall of Cash</a>” which contained “about a million dollars.”</p> <h3 id="h-2007-game-fuel-is-born" data-injectable="false">2007 – Game Fuel is born</h3> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Mountain Dew and gamers hit it off big with the <em>Halo 3</em> collaboration in 2007. This was the first incarnation of Game Fuel and would become the staple flavor moving forward. Bungie would work with several other companies to promote the title, including 7-Eleven, Burger King, and NASCAR.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair wants you to know it's been hard at work developing some "long-awaited features" that we "don't want to miss".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the Palworld team teased that the viral game will be stopping by at next month's Summer Game Fest with "a LOT of exciting things to reveal".</p>

<p>As for what those things will be? Sadly, Pocketpair has been taciturn ever since, but the tease about "long-awaited features" has a lot of fans speculating, hoping for a myriad of announcements, from a fix to the fall-through-the-floor issue that's plaguing some Xbox players, to possible variants of Pals – as teased in the accompanying image above – to news that a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-eyeing-up-palworld-head-of-indies-shuhei-yoshida-suggests"> PS5 release is finally on the way</a>.</p> <div>

<p>As Ed detailed for us recently, newer Pals added to the game don't seem particularly Pokémon-esque, though they still fit with the aesthetic of the game. At release, fans were quick to compare Pals and Pokémon, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">The Pokémon Company issuing a statement it would "investigate" the game for copyright infringement</a>, to which PocketPair insisted it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-accused-of-copying-pokemon-says-it-has-no-intention-of-infringing-intellectual-property">"no intention" of being found legally at fault</a> for any similarity between it and any other popular pocket monster franchise.</p>

            <p>A dataminer thinks they've stumbled upon the release date for Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero.</p>
<p>Poking around in publisher Bandai Namco's website, SergioM3R claims they found evidence that the next Dragon Ball game will drop on 1st October, 2024.</p>

<p>As detailed in the video above, SergioM3R has "found a place containing the release dates for a lot of Bandai Namco games", and the list seems to include the release dates of both confirmed and unconfirmed titles not via a third party, but via "Bandai Namco's own official data".</p>
<figure>

<p>While the dataminer acknowledges that nothing's set in stone until we hear directly from Bandai itself, as the list includes confirmed release dates as well as speculative ones – of which all bar one are correct – it's plausible these, too, are real. Watch this space, I guess – maybe we'll find out more next month?</p> <div>

<p>Redditors on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cv5ocz/sparking_zero_release_date/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a> add further credence to the claims, reminding us that "1 was 10/06, 2 was 10/05, and 3 was 10/04, 4 on 10/03 would continue the pattern". It also backs up other recent leaks that hinted that the game was set to release in 2024 and not 2025, as some fans feared.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-has-secured-an-esrb-rating-as-a-hidden-video-pops-up-on-the-eu-youtube-account">Dragon Ball Sparking!

Toriyama was best known for his work as the creator of the Dragon Ball manga, which was then adapted into numerous anime series, films, and video games. He also worked on multiple video games and was responsible for the character designs in Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158881/tiktok-retro-digital-camera-trend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8wE5kS">In a narrow hallway that divides the dance floor and the bathrooms at a local club, I saw some girls snapping photos. Instead of an iPhone, one of them held a retro digital camera above the group’s heads at an angle. The flash went off and I squeezed past them as they looked at the screen and giggled. It’s a small moment, but it’s also part of a much larger consumer trend. Now — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tiktok">thanks to TikTok</a> — ’90s- and 2000s-era handheld digital cameras are making a massive comeback, and I can say it’s one of the trends that’s actually well worth the hype.</p>
<p id="3Iye23">Affectionately dubbed “digi cams” online, point-and-shoot cameras have become the new darling technology of Instagram girlies everywhere. This is in large part due to TikTok, where content about digital cameras has turned into a major trend. There, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trinatuyet/photo/7330261934010289450">simple photo slideshow</a> showing off a person’s favorite cameras can garner more than 2.4 million views. People share tips for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@suitelifeofzackandkody/video/7238309031079726362">getting into digital cameras</a>. Others talk about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumnacord/video/7216387842115734826">best settings</a> to take the perfect glamour shot. Many people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnyxjpg/video/7351540087093562667">rate the cameras in their collections</a>. Even the cameras themselves are fun, since people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vateytathxoxo/video/7339543342528695585">decorate their cameras with sparkly stickers</a> and beaded wrist straps. </p>
<p id="zuFPrU">Nostalgia definitely plays a role in the hype. While some people are buying cheap (but new) cameras on the TikTok shop or choosing to shell out for more impressive new models, many of the videos emphasize that digital cameras <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiecung/video/7271990798164479238">imbue the photos with that “vintage”</a> mom-and-dad vibe from the 1990s and 2000s (if that’s when your parents grew up, that is). Digital cameras have this nice in-between status where the pictures feel a little bit more retro and novel, but they don’t require the hassle or expertise of using film. But this is not just some sort of lo-fi trend — many of the photos do actually just look better than phone photos, thanks to a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katelym/video/7304040438728625438">proper flash</a> and <a href="https://www.imore.com/4-situations-when-digital-camera-better-iphone-camera">the mechanical advantages of using a camera with a bigger lens</a>. Of course, when browsing online, you can never be sure of how a photo might be doctored or edited, but <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laurenwolfe/video/7212764119915695403">side-by-side comparisons with shots from iPhone cameras</a> attest to the added layers of color and warmth that snapping a selfie with a digital camera can add. So after mulling it over, I decided to take the $40 plunge and buy a retro camera of my own. </p>

<p id="LkTDrp">After seeing a clip on TikTok, I ended up getting a 2004 Canon PowerShot G6 because of how it seemed to capture golden light. The act of using a digital camera while out definitely feels different when compared to shooting a pic on an iPhone. With a phone, it’s easy to mindlessly mash the button and take dozens of photos in a matter of minutes. With the Canon, I took maybe two dozen photos during an entire night out, and the photos I did take I liked more than my average phone photos. Sometimes I felt disappointed by the number of blurry photos, but that didn’t take away from the charm of the experience. The photos that turned out well looked phenomenal — so much so that I already got one printed as a gift to a group of friends I had photographed on a night out. </p>
<p id="4tp7Pk">My iPhone camera tends to bring out an intense white color in direct sunlight, and features like its portrait mode often mistakenly smooth out my curly hair and awkwardly blur it out, as if it’s part of the background. Upon looking at the photos from my Canon for the first time, I was shocked by how the retro camera brought out the undertones in my skin and captured a warmer look. As a mixed person who often feels whitewashed in other (nonphotographic) ways, using an older digital camera felt affirming because it literally allowed me to see myself in a new light — one where I look browner, aka more like myself. Details like these might seem minor, but they matter to me. </p>
<p id="7bccu3">Online, a lot of the hype seems to come from how hot people can look if they use a point-and-shoot camera to take a picture, but for me, at least, it’s more than that. Looking at these photos, I feel more like myself in them. Now I can see depth on different parts of my face — like frizz from a certain part of my curl pattern, or a wrinkle in my smile that I didn’t see before. Sure, I don’t love lugging around another piece of technology, but the photos make it worth it. And for me personally, I don’t know if I’ll ever share an iPhone photo on my Instagram again. </p>

<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Both Summoners and Scholars in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are able to summon a pet to their side, which helps them in battle and supports them in times of need. You can summon them from early on, but if you want to change the appearance, you’ll need to be at least level 50.</p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">If you’re playing as Summoner or Scholar, you’ll have either a Carbuncle or Eos at your side while exploring Eorzea. While the original is nice, there are options that allow you to customize the appearance of your pet.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">Before you ask, no, you can’t have a white Carbuncle whether you’re playing as a Summoner or Scholar, even though we’ve seen at least one in<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> previously. Alphinaud, the lucky duck, has a Moonstone Carbuncle that he claims to be the final result of his research. Unfortunately, he hasn’t passed on his knowledge, so we’re unable to follow suit with our own white pet.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-change-the-appearance-of-your-pet-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to change the appearance of your pet in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Before you can even begin to think about changing your pet’s appearance, you’ll need to reach level 50 as either a Summoner or a Scholar. Once you’ve done this, head to Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks and speak to Thubyrgeim (X:4.7, Y:11.4) in the Arcanist’s Guild while equipped as a Summoner. Pick up the quest called “An Egi by Any Other Name” and complete the simple steps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to freely change the way your pet appears to yourself and everyone around you. It’s worth noting that changing the appearance of your pet is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the way it acts during battle.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The command you’re going to want to memorize is as follows:</p> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “egi name” “glamour” ”</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m going to take a second here to explain what on earth an ‘Egi’ is. ‘Egi’ is a suffix meaning ‘essense of’. Essentially, your pet is the ‘Egi’, whether you’re a Scholar with Eos at your side or a Summoner with a Carbuncle. Either way, that’s your ‘Egi’. Now that you know that, hopefully, this makes more sense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Anyway, the “egi name” section of this input will differ depending on if you’re playing as a Summoner or a Scholar. For Summoners, this will need to be changed to “carbuncle” while for Scholars, this will need to be changed to “eos”.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">The “glamour” section of the input is the most important part, and you have a few options regardless of which Job you’re playing, as well as some that are unique to each Job. Here are all of the things that can replace “glamour” in this input:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Change “glamour” to</strong></td><td><strong>Changes appearance to</strong></td></tr><tr><td>“Emerald Carbuncle”</td><td>Blue colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Topaz Carbuncle”</td><td>Yellow colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Ruby Carbuncle”</td><td>Red colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Titan-egi”</td><td>Small floating Titan (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Garuda-egi”</td><td>Small floating Garuda (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Ifrit-egi”</td><td>Small floating Ifrit (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Selene”</td><td>Replaces Eos with Selene (Scholar only)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">So, with all this information, here’s a couple of examples to hopefully make things more clear:</p> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">If you’re a Summoner who wants to replace the default blue Carbuncle with a small version of Garuda who follows you everywhere, you’d input the following into the chat box:</p> <p data-characters="52" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “carbuncle” “garuda-egi” ”</p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">Or if you’re a Scholar who wants to change Eos into a Ruby Carbuncle capable of healing you at all times, you’d input:</p>
 <p data-characters="50" data-current-count="50" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “eos” “ruby carbuncle” ”</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">If you’ve already got your pet summoned when you type in this input, you’ll need to summon them again before the changes will appear.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Here are all of the different appearances in picture format:</p> <figure data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false"> <figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figcaption>Screenshots by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-remove-a-glamour-from-a-pet-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to remove a glamour from a pet in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">If you’re not happy with your choice to change the appearance of your pet, say you want Eos back at your side while playing as Scholar rather than the Ruby Carbuncle, you can easily remove the glamour by inputting the first part of the glamouring input while leaving out the second part:</p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “eos” ”</p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">This will restore your pet back to its default appearance, so a Emerald Carbuncle for Summoners and Eos for Scholars.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hugo-award-nominees-best-sci-fi-fantasy-novel/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hugo-award-nominees-best-sci-fi-fantasy-novel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For those who don’t know, the Hugo Awards are the penultimate sci-fi and fantasy awards. Their judges pick the best books, novels, and other related media that stand out from their peers and give them the notice they deserve.&nbsp;Held yearly, the nominations for the best novels of 2023 have been announced, with the winner to be revealed&nbsp;on August 11th.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Sci-fi and Fantasy are&nbsp;wide&nbsp;genres, covering&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;ground and types of novels. Curious about this year’s nominees?&nbsp;Wondering&nbsp;if any would fit the&nbsp;type&nbsp;of book you’re looking for?&nbsp;Here&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;go over&nbsp;this year’s nominees, why they deserve the nod, and discuss what kind of readers might&nbsp;get the most enjoyment from each book.</p>
 <h2 id="h-starter-villain-by-john-scalzi" data-injectable="false">Starter Villain by John Scalzi</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">John Scalzi is no stranger to the Hugos, having been nominated multiple times and won once.&nbsp;He’s an author who runs the gamut as far as writing style goes, having written space operas that explore humanity’s desire to grow, as well as&nbsp;fun romps that elicit giggles more than anything else.&nbsp;Starter Villian would seem to trend to the latter rather than the former, but beyond a goofy and hilarious exterior are some solid critiques of late-stage capitalism and the current villains of our age.</p>
 <p data-characters="538" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">Imagine Ron Stoppable inheriting his deceased&nbsp;uncle’s&nbsp;supervillain business, complete with an island lair, as well as&nbsp;a suite of enemies still looking to take what’s theirs.&nbsp;The premise is as fun as it sounds, but what got this book nominated are the critiques that come later.&nbsp;While the&nbsp;Uncle&nbsp;was an old&nbsp;type of supervillain, those that are&nbsp;coming after him are the newer type: Tech bros backed by hedge funds, CEOs of giant corporations, and the nepo baby powerful born with money, having earned nothing themselves.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">For readers&nbsp;who are&nbsp;looking for a bit of a laugh, who love the idea of talking spy cats, or who just like seeing the ultra-wealthy fail, this will be the book for you.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh</h2> <figure data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Emily Tesh is a newer name to the Hugos, but her nomination is no less deserved. Some Desperate Glory is a deconstruction of the Space Opera genre, showing the darkness that lurks beneath many of the near-future human societies&nbsp;that we&nbsp;root for. Tesh masterfully dissects the things we don’t question that we maybe should, showing a new way forward that subverts the traditional structure of many classic sci-fi epics.</p>
 <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Our main character is one of the last remaining humans, raised from birth&nbsp;the&nbsp;enact&nbsp;vengeance on those&nbsp;that crossed&nbsp;them.&nbsp;Excelling at&nbsp;combat and frustrated with her role as a breeder to keep humanity alive,&nbsp;she sets&nbsp;out against orders to enact the vengeance she had&nbsp;been trained&nbsp;for.&nbsp;While&nbsp;vengeance is a powerful motivator, anger is also perfecting at&nbsp;blinding us&nbsp;to the evils we&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;commit.&nbsp;Tesh questions the nature of such ruling governments and how they use sexism, racism, eugenics, and more, throwing back the curtain that readers for years have been fine never looking behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">For those who love subversions of standard tropes, tales of vengeance gone awry, or&nbsp;who&nbsp;want a YA-adjacent novel that asks&nbsp;harder&nbsp;questions than you would expect, Some Desperate Glory is a solid choice.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Witch King by Martha Wells</h2> <figure data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="572" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Martha Wells is a well-known name in the sci-fi genre, with her Murderbot series already having several accolades. She seeks&nbsp;now&nbsp;to prove that no one genre can contain her as we move into her new Witch King novel, a fantasy thriller. Wells continues doing what she does best in this novel, creating incredibly real-to-life characters and throwing us into their world. While the world-building can feel breakneck for some, this gives us more time to understand the cast of characters that&nbsp;are introduced, endearing us to them in ways few authors can achieve.</p>
 <p data-characters="611" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">The novel tells two stories, both&nbsp;following the titular Witch King, Kai.&nbsp;The narrative is told from two perspectives, one past and one present, building a history of a world that Kai sought to&nbsp;overthrow&nbsp;and a future after he was betrayed and imprisoned for years. Wells is a master of passive worldbuilding, so expect bits and pieces to&nbsp;be doled out&nbsp;over the whole course of the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;large&nbsp;explanations. Still, as always, the inner workings of Well’s characters&nbsp;truly&nbsp;bring it home.&nbsp;No one writes a protagonist quite like Wells, and she&nbsp;doesn’t falter with the Witch King.</p>
 <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">For those who love a good antihero, want to be immersed in a deep world without infodumps, or just love character over everything else in a story, read The Witch King.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by S. A. Chakraborty</h2> <figure data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Harper Collins</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Chakraborty made a name for herself with her City of Brass series, bringing to life a world of Middle Eastern mythology that hasn’t seen as much fiction written about it. In the Adventures of Amina&nbsp;al-Sirafi,&nbsp;we are graced with the same intelligent writing and well-researched world-building that we expect from her, but now used to tell a tale about reaching for glory one last time.</p> <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="1070" data-injectable="true">The story follows the eponymous Amina al-Sirafi, once feared pirate of the Indian Ocean, now retired and living with her daughter in solitude. Still, when an opportunity comes for one last score, she can’t resist the itch that calls her back. The book has the feel of many heist novels, following Amina as she gets the gang back together for one last score. Still, the book is separated from the rest by vivid descriptions and incredible historical and mythological research that makes the world feel so much more alive, as well as the discussion and interest it gives to Amina’s plight, being a mid 40’s woman seeking to get back into a world she left behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">For&nbsp;those who want some good old swashbuckling action, want to read about a world and mythology that&nbsp;isn’t focused&nbsp;on often enough, or&nbsp;who&nbsp;want to read a thoughtful discussion of the give and take of returning to a life you left behind, this book will be perfect.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Saint of Bright Doors by Vajra Chandrasekera</h2> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">Perhaps the most literary title on this list, The Saint of Bright&nbsp;Doors&nbsp;is a lot of&nbsp;things.&nbsp;It is a look at the mythology of Sri Lankan Buddhists, a takedown of religion-led societies, and a discussion on colonialism, all wrapped in a surrealist shell that defies effort to define it. The book sinks&nbsp;itself&nbsp;into these questions and themes, moving at a slower pace to give readers ample time to understand the author’s points or to form questions of their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">The book follows Fetter, a once-destined assassin who forwent his calling, now wandering the world unsure, instead focusing on bright doors that have begun appearing in his home city. The book can often be hard to follow, shifting between more standard passages and incredibly dreamlike ones, where the focus and narrative shift constantly. Still, for those that stick with it, the payoffs are&nbsp;wonderful, bringing to life a vibrant and alive&nbsp;city&nbsp;and in a&nbsp;way that is breathtaking&nbsp;to read.</p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">For those who love to get lost in prose, often read more literary works on the side, or want to explore a surreal and beautiful world of mythology retold, pick up Chandrasekera’s novel.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Translation State by Ann Leckie</h2> <figure data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hachette</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Leckie won a Hugo&nbsp;previously for the novel Ancillary Justice.&nbsp;In Translation State, we return to this same universe, though&nbsp;the book can be read&nbsp;as a standalone for the uninitiated.&nbsp;The book is full of Leckie’s usual charm, endearing characters fighting for what they believe in, told in a&nbsp;way that feels cozy and inviting.&nbsp;This novel once again focuses on the issues of the future, but rather&nbsp;than focusing on the danger of empires and other Space Opera tropes, Translation State instead chooses to focus on social aspects.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">The book focuses on three separate characters, each with their problems but with one overarching thread tying them together: How do our genetics affect us? Do they determine who we are? Are we bound by these ideas predetermined at birth? The characters&nbsp;each&nbsp;grapple with this question in their own way, exploring from many angles the&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;of self-determination rather than our genetics deciding who we&nbsp;are&nbsp;and the trials we must go through to enact change that allows us to live in the ways we want.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">For those who like books that ask questions of the future, enjoy good character as a primary motivator, or want a great way to understand many of the social&nbsp;quandaries&nbsp;that affect us today, read Translation State.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Welcome to Stardew Valley, where each season brings a new crop of bountiful food to make for friends and family," teases the blurb. "From farm staples like veggies, fruit, milk, and eggs to foraged mushrooms and berries to fresh fish, there's always something delicious to put on the table.</p>
<p>"These 50 recipes are based on in-game meals and food, allowing you to cook and eat all your home-grown and fresh-caught ingredients in real life. The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook is organised by season and has recipes from your favourite characters, including the Queen of Sauce and Gus at the Stardrop Saloon. Written in collaboration with independent game creator ConcernedApe and packed with original illustrations and food photography, The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook helps you bring the Valley's incredible flavours to the dinner table, giving you the energy to take on the world."</p>
<p>Sadly, the US <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/719873/the-official-stardew-valley-cookbook-by-concernedape-and-ryan-novak/">Penguin Random House website</a> doesn't ship to the UK, but you may be able to find the Stardew Valley Cookbook via third-party sellers on Amazon UK.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first video game to roll out an accompanying cookbook; mostly recently we told you about recipes inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neopets-starts-its-25th-anniversary-celebrations-early-with-this-new-cookbook">Neopets</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-official-minecraft-cookbook-is-on-the-way">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-that-five-nights-at-freddys-cookbook-youve-always-dreamed-about">Five Nights At Freddy's</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-official-halo-cookbook-has-been-revealed">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destinys-official-cookbook-launches-in-two-weeks">Destiny 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-final-fantasy-14-cookbook-coming-out-later-this-year">Final Fantasy 14</a> have also spawned food-related spin-offs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone said he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">"not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In an interview about his plans for Stardew Valley's following its recent 1.6 update, Barone said that he doesn't feel pressured to create a follow-up game, stating: "It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it".</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, the long-running film franchise now has ten films. Throughout its semicentennial lifespan, the series has undergone several drastic evolutions, going from meditative science-fiction epics to corny blockbusters and back again multiple times.</p> <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">No two<em> Planet of the Apes </em>films are alike; needless to say, some are better than others. Here are our rankings of all the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> series films, from worst to best.</p> <h2 id="h-10-planet-of-the-apes-2001" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (2001)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Planet Of The Apes | #TBT Trailer | 20th Century FOX" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-a4eIA8KWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">After an almost forty-year hiatus, 2001’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em> set out to bring the series back into the spotlight. With acclaimed director Tim Burton at the helm, everyone assumed <em>Planet of the Apes</em> would put the series back on the map.</p> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">It did, but not in the way <em>Planet of the Apes </em>fans had hoped it would. While Rick Baker’s prosthetic effects are undeniably impressive, the film’s decision to trade the original’s thoughtful social commentary for easily digestible man vs. ape action left the film feeling shallow. Coupled with a wooden cast of human leads and a muddled plot ending in a frustratingly confusing “plot twist,” it’s easy to see why Burton’s take sent the series into another extended hibernation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-battle-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-1973" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. <em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes</em> (1973)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The final film in the original Planet of the Apes saga, <em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes</em> chronicles Caesar’s attempt to preserve the fragile peace between the apes and humans who survived nuclear armageddon. Unfortunately, a militant gorilla general and a league of anti-ape humans soon rise to challenge Caesar’s ideals.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false"><em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes </em>benefits from an enticing premise and a strong performance by lead actor Roddy McDowell<em>. </em>However, the film’s exceptionally shotty costume design and limp climax prevent it from being the epic, cathartic finale it could have been.</p> <h2 id="h-8-beneath-the-planet-of-the-apes-1970" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> (1970)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Trailer #1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOSEpi8K-XM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Despite being a direct sequel to the original <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> is anything but a by-the-books continuation. Turning the camera away from the apes and introducing a tribe of telepathic, subterranean humans, <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> is the strangest and most controversial film in the series.</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While some viewers applaud <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em>‘ willingness to defy audience expectations, others are critical of the film’s surreal atmosphere and surprisingly bleak tone.</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-conquest-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1972" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</em> (1972)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The darkest film in the series, <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Ape</em>s shoves the series’ underlying themes of oppression and revolution to the forefront. Set in a post-plague United States where apes are slaves, the film follows the time-traveling chimpanzee Cornelius and Zira’s son Milo’s transforming from a meek circus ape to a violent revolutionary.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Wearing its political undertones on its sleeves, <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a gritty, angry film that thoroughly explores humanity’s capacity for violence. While the version that made its way to theaters toned things down by changing its brutal ending, the film remains a haunting meditation on the horrors of slavery and the consequences of violent uprisings.</p> <h2 id="h-6-planet-of-the-apes-1968" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (1968)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Planet of the Apes (1968) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0-dUM_A-Cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The film that started it all, the original Planet of the Apes is a film that everyone knows about, if only through pop-culture osmosis. Following the trials and triumphs of an astronaut stranded in a world where apes rule, the film is as iconic as it is for a reason.</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">With a compelling premise, powerhouse lead, and an intriguing story that ends in one of the most iconic twists of all time, <em>Planet of the Apes</em> is one of the most influential science-fiction movies ever made.</p>
 <h2 id="h-5-escape-from-the-planet-of-the-apes-1971" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> (1971)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Despite <em>Beneath the Planet Apes</em>‘s best efforts, <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> found a new way to keep the original franchise going: time travel. In an attempt to escape the impending demise of their world, chimpanzee scientists Cornelius and Zira travel back in time to the then-present year of 1971, with their presence creating a self-fulfilling time-loop that will change the future of humans and apes forever.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Sporting a well-written script and powerful performances from its costumed leads, <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> weaves an emotional story about empathy, parenthood, and racial unrest that’s as relevant today as it was over fifty years ago.</p> <h2 id="h-4-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2024" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2024)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true">The newest film in the series, <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, picks up where Matt Reeves’ Planet of the Apes trilogy left off, with the civilization of apes led by Casaer firmly established as the dominant species on the planet. The film follows Noa, a young chimpanzee who must journey across the post-apocalyptic United States to rescue his tribe from the mad dictator Proximus Caesar, leading him toward a fateful encounter with a young human named Mae.</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes </em>has many great things going for it, including top-tier special effects and an excellent cast of characters with fun and exciting relationships. While the film does more sequel-baiting than I would have liked, it’s still a fun, heartfelt experience that stands on its own as a solid series relaunch.</p> <h2 id="h-3-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2011" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2011)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">The first entry in Matt Reeve’s three-part revival, <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes, </em>is an excellent start to the franchise’s most recent chapter. The film follows Caesar, a chimpanzee taken into the home of the kind researcher who rescues him from an inhumane laboratory. From there, Caesar experiences humanity’s capacity for unconditional love and unflinching cruelty, transforming into the leader who helps other rapidly evolving apes find freedom.</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"><em>Rise of the Planet of the Ape is</em> everything movie-goers look for in a reboot. With an intelligent script that stays true to the series’ themes, some well-shot action, and a compelling new protagonist, <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes </em>is the triumphant return to form that fans of the series had spent decades waiting for.</p> <h2 id="h-2-war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-2017" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. <em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> (2017)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> brings Matt Reeves’ trilogy to a brutal, beautiful, and bittersweet end. After a ruthless militia declares war on Caesar’s tribe, he and his people embark on an epic journey that forces the increasingly-messianic ruler to question what kind of future he’s built for his family and whether his pacifistic approach to human-ape relations will bring prosperity or ruin.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> lives up to its title in every way imaginable, with the filmmakers drawing clear inspiration from war movies like <em>Apocalypse Now </em>and <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em>. With another well-written screenplay that analyzes the cyclical nature of violence and the renewing power of hope, <em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> is an epic conclusion to an already fantastic trilogy.</p> <h2 id="h-1-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2014" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2014)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Dawn of the Planet of the Apes | Official Trailer [HD] | PLANET OF THE APES" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sHMCRaS3ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes </em>is one of those rare middle chapters of a trilogy that surpasses the films that came before and after it. Ten years after the simian flu outbreak, Caesar and his tribe are approached by a group of humans who want to ally with them, sparking tension between him and his second in command, Koba.</p> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="false">To put it bluntly, <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Ape</em> is everything you’d want out of a <em>Planet of the Apes</em> movie: gorgeous special effects, excellent cinematography, and compelling conflict that makes it hard to tell at times who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong. Whether you’re in the mood for some top-tier action or up for an emotional tour de force, <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em> is for you.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When it comes to video games, there are a lot of memorable characters. Outside of their design or role within a game, what makes these characters memorable is their voice, and every one of these comes as a result of actors spending hours in a recording booth.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">There are a lot of voice actors out there, but some are more prolific or memorable than others. Their voices resonate in our heads as part of the characters we come to love while playing, but who’s behind these voices and where else have they appeared?</p> <h2 id="h-joel-miller-the-last-of-us-troy-baker" data-injectable="false">Joel Miller (<em>The Last of Us</em>) – Troy Baker</h2> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Troy Baker might be one of the most well-known voices in video games. He’s not only the voice of Joel in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-no-return-mode-explained-is-it-worth-it/">The Last of Us</a></em> but also Higgs Monaghan in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hideo-kojimas-death-stranding-documentary-is-available-for-streaming-now/">Death Stranding</a></em>, John Jones in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/epic-says-it-will-appeal-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-in-fortnite/">Fortnite</a></em>, The Joker in <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em>, and the voice of Snow in multiple <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, including <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-harley-quinn-arkham-city-tara-strong" data-injectable="false">Harley Quinn (<em>Arkham City</em>) – Tara Strong&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rocksteady Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Tara Strong is a voice that’s iconic for multiple generations. To me, she’s Timmy from <em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>. To my daughter, she’s Princess Twilight Sparkle from the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/as-a-parent-i-cant-wait-for-my-little-pony-a-zephyr-heights-mystery-heres-why/">My Little Pony</a></em> franchise. In video games, Tara has played not only Harley Quinn in multiple titles, but you can also hear her voice in <em>Rage</em>, and she’s the voice of Rikku in <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>.</p>  <figure data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">While David Hayter is perhaps most well known for his role as Snake in the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> franchise and outside of it in other titles, he’s also appeared as the Winter Soldier in <em>Marvel Heroes</em>, a Jedi Knight in <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, and has multiple voice roles in the <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> game, released in 1997.</p> <h2 id="h-mario-multiple-charles-martinet" data-injectable="false">Mario (Multiple) – Charles Martinet</h2> <figure data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">I can’t in all good conscience write this list without including Charles Martinet. His voice simply <em>is</em> Mario to anyone who has ever played a single game of the franchise. However, Mario isn’t Charles’ only voice role in the world of video games. He’s appeared as Orvus in <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time</em>, Vigoro in <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>, and, perhaps surprisingly, The Cat in the Hat in a few titles aimed at kids, such as <em>Dr. Seuss Toddler</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-asterion-baldur-s-gate-iii-neil-newbon" data-injectable="false">Asterion (<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>) – Neil Newbon</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">If <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lulusland._/video/7271534596225879328?lang=en">TikTok is to be believed</a>, Neil Newbon is the voice of everybody’s favorite Dom. However, before he was the voice of Asterion, Neil appeared in the <em>Resident Evil</em> games as Karl Heisenberg in <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and Nicholai in <em>Resident Evil Resistance</em>. He also played two roles in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, Elijah Kamski and Gavin Reed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-ezio-auditore-assassin-s-creed-ii-trilogy-roger-craig-smith" data-injectable="false">Ezio Auditore (<em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> Trilogy) – Roger Craig Smith</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Roger Crag Smith, I’m not ashamed to say, played a pivotal role in the formation of my love for gaming. I was, and remain to this day, obsessed with <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> and will always consider it the best of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles. However, Roger Craig Smith has appeared in many more video games. He’s played Kale Vandelay and SEB-AAA in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer/">Hi-Fi RUSH</a></em>, Sonic the Hedgehog in multiple titles and Mirage in Apex Legends. Most recently, you might recognize his voice as Mission Control in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/">Helldivers 2</a></em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tiny-tina-borderlands-ashly-burch" data-injectable="false">Tiny Tina (<em>Borderlands</em>) – Ashly Burch</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Although most recognizable for her voice as Tiny Tina in the <em>Borderlands</em> games, Ashley Burch has played a lot of memorable characters in other titles. She’s the voice of Aloy in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Nebula in<em> Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series</em>, Mel in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and also provided the voice of Chloe Price in both <em>Life is Strange</em> games.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-urianger-final-fantasy-xiv-timothy-watson" data-injectable="false">Urianger (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>) – Timothy Watson</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Aside from gracing the world with the purely Shakespearean presence that is Urianger Augurelt in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, Timothy Watson has also appeared in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> as King Burgred, has multiple voice roles in <em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, and played Mumkhar in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-glados-portal-ellen-mcclain" data-injectable="false">GLaDOS (<em>Portal</em>) – Ellen McClain</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Valve</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">The voice of everybody’s favorite psychopathic robot from the <em>Portal </em>games was provided by Ellen McClain, but it wasn’t the first time she provided an iconic robotic female voice in the world of video games. Ellen is also the voice behind the Combine Overwatch AI in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/this-youtuber-has-been-uploading-half-life-3-updates-every-day-for-over-six-years/">Half-Life</a> 2</em>. She also appears in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> as one of Delamain’s split personalities, though this one was modeled after GlaDOS.</p>

He’s also appeared as Bhaal in <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>, Robert Nightingale in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/alan-wake-2-patch-will-optimize-for-older-nvidia-gpus/">Alan Wake II</a></em>, and provides multiple additional voices in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. Outside of gaming, Doug also played the role of Father John Maloney in 2001’s <em>Band of Brothers</em>.</p>

  <p id="lUcMOb">It’s a good time to be an X-Men fan. The stellar first season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24158520/x-men-97-season-1-review"><em>X-Men ‘97</em></a><em> </em>just wrapped up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22665398/wolverine-marvel-insomniac-games-playstation">Insomniac Games is working on a Wolverine game</a> for PlayStation 5, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23344459/x-men-marvel-movies-mcu">the mutants are (someday) coming to the MCU</a>.</p>
<p id="xGM35c">But it’s been a while since there have been good options for X-Men fans who want to game in that universe. Gone are the days of multiple X-Men arcade games and fighting games to choose from, or movie tie-ins. There have been a lot of disappointing X-Men games (looking at you, <em>X-Men: Destiny</em>), but what about the good ones?</p>
<p id="BG9P48">The Polygon staff has collected the X-Men games that are actually good, from the dawn of <s>the mutant age</s> gaming to even a few recent releases that revive X-Men gaming. Most are not available to play anymore, but they live on in our hearts nonetheless.</p>

<p id="pRZ0cj">Ideally, you’ll be playing <em>X-Men</em> on an original arcade cabinet alongside three strangers, the four of you thrown together into a makeshift family as you step into the shoes of Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Colossus, Nightcrawler or Dazzler. It won’t take long to beat — maybe 30-45 minutes, like a great episode of television — and you’ll walk away victorious, having destroyed Sentinels and other classic baddies until you reach Magneto, who has kidnapped Xavier for some reason (although if you’ve seen <em>X-Men ‘97</em>, you might be able to imagine some good reasons). </p>
<p id="sK5pca">This game is an all-time classic for a reason; each character has different special abilities, just like the characters they’re based on, and as simplistic as the beat-em-up mechanics may be, it’s still one of the most accurate and fun adaptations that the X-Men have ever had across video games. Oddly enough, this version of the team was actually based on the failed 1989 cartoon <em>X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men</em> that got one pilot episode and no more, but the X-Men have such distinctive visual designs that this part never really mattered. —<em>Maddy Myers</em></p>

<p id="92MRbg">This may shock you, but there are few better-looking Genesis games than <em>X-Men 2: Clone Wars</em>. It is shocking how richly detailed its 16-bit graphics are, and how finely-tuned its action feels. Headgames’ side-scrolling platformer has a number of flourishes uncommon in licensed games at the time, from a cold open that drops you into the game as a random character the moment you start it to a surprisingly involved story ripped from the recently-wrapped “Phalanx Covenant” comics arc. What’s more, <em>Clone Wars</em> beat <em>X2</em> to one of its big twists — midway through the game, Magneto joins the team, and he looks freaking sick. —<em>Joshua Rivera</em></p>

<p id="0hBYDl">Both <em>X-Men Legends</em> games were squad-based action role-playing games that fully leaned into the team nature of the X-Men, allowing you to bring four of the mutants into missions at once. Both games’ combat were simple but evocative, and successfully leaned on the varied abilities of the different X-Men. The roster was pretty deep, too — the first game had 14 playable characters (plus Professor X on specific missions), and the sequel added some from Magneto’s Brotherhood of mutants as well.</p>
<p id="NdJoLL">The main reason these games feel so fitting for the X-Men franchise to me is the team-based nature, an essential part of the X-Men’s whole deal. And they were even more fun co-op — I have many fond memories of playing and replaying these games (or even just the Danger Room missions) with my brother growing up.</p>
<p id="WjvvP6">Additional shoutout to the also quite fun Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, the successor to these games from Raven Software and Activision, expanding the scope to the broader Marvel universe. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="7cmFlu">For most of video games’ short history, a licensed game based on a good movie was rarely very good. A licensed game based on a terrible one? A fool’s errand. As the kids say, <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> had no business going this hard. In an unusual move, Raven Software’s flagship PS3 and Xbox 360 version of Wolverine was an M-rated game significantly more violent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380553/deadpool-3-wolverine-x-men-origins-ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman">than the film it was based on</a>, resulting in a <em>God of War</em>-inspired bloody hack-and-slash adventure, blending the movie’s storyline with an expanded original plot. The result was a brutally satisfying video game, and sadly the end of Raven’s excellent tenure on Marvel titles that kicked off with <em>X-Men Legends</em>. In a few short years, the studio would be altogether done developing its own games as well, shifting into a new role as a Call of Duty support studio. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="vnD5QT">Starting with <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> (1996) and landing with a thud on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/18/16323994/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite</em></a> (2017), the X-Men/Capcom crossover fighting game series has had its ups and downs, and even as I write this blurb, I’m second-guessing my own attempt to select the best of the entire run. Several entries have strong points in their favor (we need not speak of <em>Infinite</em>). But you can’t <em>not</em> vote for Rogue’s iconic divekick, which she first performs in <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> and which features its final appearance in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22648751/marvel-vs-capcom-2-classic-quest-retro-gaming-capcom-fighting-game-community"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em></a>. It’s a move so beloved that it got a nod in <em>X-Men ‘97</em>. If you want to not only see but <em>be </em>Rogue when she’s punching people’s lights out — and who doesn’t? — you cannot do better than <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>. —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="thpBi9">Simply put: <em>Children of the Atom</em> walked so <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> could run. The developer’s first entry into what would be a wildly popular series of Marvel fighting games is barebones compared to the 3v3 spectacle later games would be known for, but those bones are solid: It’s effectively a maximalist version of <em>Street Fighter</em> circa 1994, with longer combos, super jumps, and new movesets that would continue to be refined as its characters appeared in subsequent Marvel fighting games. But its most significant achievement might be in its character design: Faithful yet idiosyncratic, the X-Men as rendered in <em>Children of the Atom</em> are unmistakably Capcom designs, with just a hint of <em>Street Fighter: Alpha’s</em> anime inflection, but also pitch-perfect tributes to <em>X-Men</em> artist Jim Lee. The proof was in the pudding: Arcade players could fight Street Fighter villain Akuma as a secret character, and console players could play as him themselves — and he fit right in. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="rI4kze">I know what you’re thinking: “Is this an X-Men game?” Wolverine, Magik, and Storm are in it — plus Deadpool, who at least works with the X-Men often enough, and Scarlet Witch, who is sometimes a mutant depending on the canon — so we’re letting this one in. Perhaps more importantly, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> has the <em>vibe </em>of the best X-Men stories. This is a team-up strategy game, with super-powered characters all thrown unwittingly together in a strange mansion. In battle, they’ll trade barbs and one-liners; back at home, they’ll romance each other and bicker. If that’s not quintessential X-Men, what is? —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="4I2Qug"><em>X-Men Cartoon Maker</em> is not so much a game as it is a sandbox for creating your very own episodes of <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em> using character models, sound effects, and background images from the original show, plus a sound library of funky ‘90s instrumental tracks that mostly seem fitting as backing tracks for fight scenes and dramatic standoffs (for which the show was known, of course). Composing scenes and using the rudimentary cartooning tools does feel clunky, but the end results can be uniquely hilarious. Check out this high-effort piece of art uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVLxUVA7ds8">YouTube</a> by one diligent X-Men Cartoon Maker fan for an example of what you can pull off. —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="WoYcsz">Some may argue with my inclusion of this 1993 Sega Genesis exclusive based on its grueling difficulty, but I’d like to make my case based on the attention to detail for each of the four playable characters and its truly infamous end-game stunt. Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Gambit are all present, and each come with unique, character-appropriate powers. Cyclops does his laser blasts, Nightcrawler teleports, Wolverine snickety snicks, and Gambit throws playing cards (I’m sorry Gambit fans, it’s always been weird). </p>
<p id="YJKX0V">You play as these four X-Men, trapped in the Danger Room, and your “lives” are simply the four playable characters. Since each has unique abilities, successfully finishing this action platformer meant carefully budgeting your approach to each level and boss. Which makes the late-game stunt all the more wild: In order to end the Danger Room simulation, you need to <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25453192/vlcsnap_2024_05_17_15h36m31s194.png">“reset the computer”</a> which you’d think would accomplished by pressing a button on the controller, presumably “press F to pay respects” style, right?</p>
<p id="CjyXYN">Nope! You tap the actual “Reset” button on the Sega Genesis! And if you press it too long, it actually resets the Genesis and you lose all your progress. This was 1993! I applaud the absolute sickos who made this game the stuff of schoolyard lore, and my apologies to everyone retraumatized by this memory. —<em>Chris Grant</em></p>

<p id="OzC8Ch">While many will know <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074262/cmon-gamefound-exclusivity-agreement">CMON</a> for its action-packed cooperative board game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/25/20932599/zombicide-second-edition-kickstarter"><em>Zombicide</em></a>, the tabletop publisher has a much newer series called <em>Marvel United</em>. The original game earned more than $2.8 million on Kickstarter in 2020, only to be followed by <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/marvel-united-x-men/"><em>Marvel United: X-Men</em></a> with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/marvel-united-x-men/description">nearly $6 million in funding</a>. </p>
<p id="OGUolC">This card-driven action game puts players in the role of X-Men mutants like Wolverine, Jean Grey, Storm, and Cyclops as they go up against Magneto, Juggernaut and more. The big draw here are the adorable, chibi-style miniature characters. The big-headed heroes are an absolute joy to paint, and at $34.99 the game is extremely affordable. —<em>Charlie Hall </em></p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Can a hero even be called cool if they never face opponents who test their limits? We want to see odds that look insurmountable, even for supermen who shoot lasers from their eyes and manage to hide their identity only by wearing a pair of glasses.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false">While it might seem like too daunting of a task, fiction authors sure have done a great job at diving into their scariest nightmares to pull out these absolute monsters.</p>  <figure data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-t-1000-terminator-2" data-injectable="false">10. T-1000 (Terminator 2)</h2> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">The T-1000 is as close as a good AI — not a real-world one — was able to come to the perfect killing machine. Its body is composed entirely of liquid metal, meaning that bullets can, at best, hope to slow him down a little. He has full control over the metallic goo he’s made of, meaning that he can conjure swords and even impersonate anyone he sees.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">How scary is the T-1000? Well, if regular Arnold Schwarzenegger is already pretty scary, then remember that this guy is even more powerful than a robot version of Arnie.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Giygas (Earthbound)</h2> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Giygas from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/earthbound-so-whats-the-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earthbound</a></em> is an alien lifeform who can will reality into collapsing. It serves as a very enticing final villain not just because he has world-ending powers but also because he’ll fill your brain with imagery so foul that you might lose your mind long before you perish.</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">In all fairness, though, this being of immense cosmic power does end up getting defeated by a bunch of kids, so there’s that.</p> <figure data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Adrien Veidt/ Ozymandias (Watchmen)</h2> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">Adrien Veidt’s most dangerous trait is thinking that he’s a good guy. He believes he has the ability to save the world, whatever that might mean, so he stops at nothing to achieve his goals. </p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">Ozymandias, his “heroic” alter-ego, ends up murdering hundreds of thousands of people after his master plan succeeds, but we never see any guarantee that his awful actions will ever even lead to postponing the end of the world. What scares me the most about Ozymandias is that he makes me sometimes wonder if there’s one rich person out there who can one day pull this off. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. Sauron (The Lord Of The Rings)</h2> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Sauron is the quintessential super warlord of the Fantasy genre. He was powerful enough as an evil shapeshifter, but powerful enough is never enough when you are a supervillain. He also created an artifact that bestowed upon him immense power and the ability to enslave the minds of some of the most powerful inhabitants of Middle Earth.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Sauron is unbeatable in combat as long as he’s wearing the One Ring and will never die unless you destroy the ring — a task that I’ve heard isn’t particularly easy.</p>  <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII, Kingdom Hearts, Super Smash Bros.)</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">Sephiroth is a highly trained SOLDIER who also benefits from sharing a genetic bloodline with a race of alien deities. He’s too drunk with power to be slowed down by any sense of empathy or mercy, but that isn’t even the scariest thing about him. Sephiroth is one of the few villains in media who can nullify the hero’s ability to always save their love (?) interest.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">When not trying to blow up the planet he inhabits by pulling in meteors, he can be seen kicking your ass as the hardest boss of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> multiverse. You know you’re about to have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-final-bosses-in-video-game-history-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bad time whenever this guy shows up.</a></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Doomsday (Death Of Superman, Batman V Superman)</h2> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="830" data-injectable="true">Doomsday only has the ability to grow a natural defense against whatever you throw at him. Shoot him once, and he’ll get hurt and pissed off. Shoot him a second time, and he’ll only get pissed off. That’s pretty scary as is, but we learn that by the time we first see him, Doomsday has already been subject to countless years of violent experiments. He’s the only creature in fiction who was ever able to kill Superman, and he didn’t need to buy a single Kryptonite knife from Amazon to achieve that.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Femto (Berserk)</h2> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Femto is the result of a deal that saw the mercenary Griffith reborn as a member of the fearsome Godhand. Femto is incredibly strong and can warp reality, but that’s not even the worst of it. The problem is that he cannot even be harmed by any known means. Anything you throw at him that would pose any sort of threat just goes through him as if he were a ghost. Going up against Femto is like fighting a cheater who has god mode and noclip on.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Even before he was Femto, Griffith was the biggest backstabber in the history of art. The only thing in life worse than being betrayed by the person you love is seeing them then turn into a quantically immortal being of pure evil, which is what the hero of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk/">Berserk</a></em> also has to deal with.</p>  <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Harbinger (Mass Effect)</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">Whereas the Borg from <em>Star Trek </em>will assimilate humans into their hive mind, the Reapers from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></em> just melt people into goo and use them as building materials. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">They’re the scariest alien fleet you can have invading your planet because they’re the most technologically advanced civilization in their universe. Harbinger, first introduced in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, seems to be their leader. Whereas the other villains on this list are only confined to one planet (at a time, at least), Harbinger’s goons can get you wherever you are.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Cyberdreams</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. AM (I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream)</h2> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The Allied Mastercomputer, AM, from Harlan Ellison’s masterpiece short story and the video game of the same name, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-have-no-mouth-but-i-must-tell-you-about-this-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream</a></em>, is not only one of the most powerful villains in fiction, it’s also undisputedly one of the most vile. </p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">AM is an AI made by the best minds in its world solely to find ways to hurt humans, and that’s exactly what he’s done for untold millennia when the story is set. After he takes over the planet Earth, AM is indestructible, relentless, and able to torture and kill with great efficacy. Still, the worst part is how he’s also able to heal and make his victims immortal, allowing him to torture them forever.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Thing | The Blood Test" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2o2FRwn_hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. The Thing (John Carpenter’s The Thing)</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">When I said that <em>The Thing </em>is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-horror-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the scariest Sci-Fi Horror movie of all time</a>, I wasn’t joking. The titular Thing is an intelligent organism with the ability to consume and replace any organic or inorganic material in existence. Sure, it can bite your head off, but it can just as well kill, eat, and replace all your loved ones before it does the same to you. </p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">It only needs one functioning cell to consume an entire planet, and it’s smart enough to build spaceships to visit other planets when it’s done with yours. You might be able to defeat <em>The Thing</em>, but you’ll never have the mental strength to shake off the paranoia that will forever haunt your every thought whenever you talk to another person or, even worse, try to pet a cute dog.</p>
