<p>Legends: Z-A will also be available on the Switch</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>As we've already mentioned, October is a huge month for the Switch 2 (and Switch) with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>So far, there's been some Mega reveals and distribution events announced, and now Nintendo has sunk some of its marketing budget for the game into a commercial featuring the 'Stranger Things' star, Gaten Matarazzo.</p>
<p>The Netflix series is currently in its fifth season, and although there are no links here, Matarazzo is known to be a big fan of Nintendo and has previously teamed up with the company to promote titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this new commercial we get to see the star harness the power of Mega Evolutions, while also highlighting how the Switch 2 is just as playable, when you're out and about, as Nintendo's original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A launches for the Switch 2 and original Switch on 16th October 2025. It's arriving in between an already action-packed month of game releases. The new Pokémon game will also be joined by a new Switch 2 bundle on the same date, which includes a copy of the latest entry.</p>

                <p>Earlier today, developer Teenage Astronauts and publisher No More Robots were preparing to launch their new role-playing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-rocket-lab/" data-ref-id="5000-654308">Little Rocket Lab</a>. Unfortunately for the team, Steam went down just as the game was about to launch.</p><p>Mike Rose--the founder of No More Robots--shared his reaction to this turn of events on social media.</p><p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m2mlu7vudc2h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a follow-up message</a> an hour later, Rose said he was "livid," before <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m2mnh3nqtc2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expressing his relief</a> when Steam went back online. Players can now grab Little Rocket Lab on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Xbox. No More Robots released a trailer for the game as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWY496AV5U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgWY496AV5U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as a young engineer named Morgan, and her ultimate goal is to fulfill her family's dream of building a rocket ship. Before she can get to that point, Morgan has to rebuild her family home and put her skills to use in her hometown, St. Ambroise, and make life easier on the people who live there.</p><p>Last month, indie developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel shared a letter from Steam acknowledging that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-bug-botched-this-indie-games-launch-now-its-getting-a-second-chance/1100-6534899/" data-ref-id="1100-6534899">had botched the launch</a> of their game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri</a>. Steam offered the developers the visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Steam recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-game-update-reportedly-distributed-malware-and-stole-money-from-cancer-victim/1100-6534915/" data-ref-id="1100-6534915">removed a game</a> called BlockBlasters for distributing malware. It may have even stolen money from a cancer patient. Steam also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-new-personalized-menu-is-now-widely-available/1100-6534990/" data-ref-id="1100-6534990">rolled out personalized menus</a> near the end of September. Despite Steam's dominance in the PC realm, a new study suggests that Xbox users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-users-reportedly-play-more-games-than-ps5-or-steam-players-and-theres-one-big-reason-why/1100-6534950/" data-ref-id="1100-6534950">play more games than they do on PS5 or Steam</a> thanks to Game Pass.</p>

<p>We're taking baby steps with this one</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="bc74c5000bab3"><a title="Nintendo Life Image" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc74c5000bab3/nintendo-life-image.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday surprised <em>everyone</em> with a new animated short called '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-goes-full-pixar-in-strange-new-animated-short-film-close-to-you">Close To You</a></strong>', and it's already led to all sorts of theories online.</p>
<p>We know Nintendo is currently in the process of expanding beyond video games with theme parks and movies. It's also got its video production company '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/nintendo-launches-official-website-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">Nintendo Pictures</a>' and recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Mario product line in Japan</a> for younger audiences, made up of rattles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">building blocks with amiibo functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Then there's perhaps the most common claim that this new video is tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>. If you watch the short, it appears there's <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1975553503524458919"><em>something</em> invisible</a> moving all the objects in the scene, and Nintendo enthusiasts online have <a href="https://x.com/RogersBase/status/1975703210863304718">seemingly matched up the music</a> in this trailer with the game series.</p>
<p>We've even got <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/53641-nintendo-drops-close-to-you-animated-short-update">past quotes from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto</a> telling us how Pikmin are "all over our world" and "invisible to the naked eye". So, what do you think? Is this something to do with Pikmin, or do you think it's something completely different? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ejae, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna are set to perform on&nbsp;<em>The Tonight Show</em> in just a few hours, which will mark the trio’s first live performance as Huntr/x, the pop stars from <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em></a>. (At least, not counting <a href="https://youtu.be/LW9QJIT_T-A?si=mK7N33Yd-8Q2GEnz">a cameo in a skit</a> during this weekend’s <em>Saturday Night Live </em>in which they didn’t even perform a full song.) But in advance of that debut performance later tonight, the band has released a new song with no fanfare, one that wasn’t featured in the Netflix musical. Or at least that’s what Spotify is currently indicating. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yNNYQBChuox9A5Ka93BIn?si=bD2voW0ITLeASfThiMvk-g">Huntr/x Spotify account</a> posted a song called “Mazatlan By Night” on Sunday, and it’s only accumulated about 6,000 listens so far. Considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">how big <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>has become</a> in the past few months, you’d think a new song from the titular girl group would have exploded in even just a few days. So what’s up with this song? Well, for one thing, it doesn’t seem to actually be a Huntr/x song.</p> <p>Sometimes other artists’ work will appear on a group’s Spotify page if they’re featured or if one of their songs is sampled, but I’ve listened to the <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>soundtrack hundreds of times and couldn’t pick out anything from this piece that would put Huntr/x anywhere near the credits. I tried using the Shazam app, which listens to music and gives you the title, and it couldn’t identify the song as anything, much less a new song by Rumi, Zoey, and Mira. This could have been uploaded to the Huntr/x account in error, or there might be something more nefarious going on. The song’s copyright is for “Diskerux Diamond,” which doesn’t bring up any search results on Google. Well, it might bring up this article now. We’ve reached out to Universal Music Group for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p>  <p>It’s entirely possible the account was hacked and someone uploaded this song to the Huntr/x account without authorization. Or it could have been a technical error that…somehow ended up on the Spotify page of one of the biggest groups in music right now. Sorry to the 6,000 of you that listened to it expecting something new from the girls. But hey, at least we’ll get to hear them performing “Golden” live on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in a little bit.</p>

NBC is piloting the <em>Wordle</em> game show with the help of Fallon’s production company, and the show is currently filming in the UK. Savannah Guthrie will host.</p><p>Around when <em>Wordle</em> really started to blow up, Jimmy Fallon once spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcZWd75Ph4Q">a whole segment of <em>The Tonight Show</em></a> solving a puzzle in front of his audience. (The segment aired right before <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">bought <em>Wordle</em></a> from creator Josh Wardle in early 2022.) Fingers crossed this TV show isn’t just one person muddling through a puzzle like Fallon did — I got frustrated watching the segment because I just wanted to make my own guesses. Instead, I hope this <em>Wordle</em> TV show takes cues from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show)"><em>Lingo</em></a>, a game show where teams compete to quickly solve <em>Wordle</em>-like puzzles for prize money. It’s much snappier.</p><p>While it’s not guaranteed that this <em>Wordle</em> show will actually air, given <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wordle-the-daily-obsessions-of-millions/">just how popular <em>Wordle</em> is</a>, I’m guessing it has a decent shot of actually coming out.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/795536/wordle-tv-game-show-jimmy-fallon-savannah-guthrie-nbc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Quick, gather 'round everyone. New Mario levels just dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You heard me. New levels. In Mario. Specifically, in Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, a game that first released in 1986 and which, you'd think, everyone had already discovered every single secret in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope. There was still more to find. And a speedrunner named Kosmic managed to uncover over 20 previously unseen (and at times <em>very</em> glitchy) playable levels in the game after a lot of community help, experimentation, patience, and jumping off springs.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/after-39-years-new-mario-levels-discovered-7-1759872246004.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image via Kosmic on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kosmic has recorded his full journey in a 40-minute video here, and I highly recommend watching it because he does some crazy stuff and has a detailed explanation of how and why this works the way it does. But very, <em>very</em> basically, in the original Super Mario Bros. and its sequel, The Lost Levels, the game determines what level and world to send you to at the end of each level based on what object you "use" to clear the level. Grabbing a flagpole increases the "Area" number by 1 (the "2" in "1-2") while grabbing the axe on a castle bridge increases the "World" number (sending you to "2-1" after beating "1-4", for instance).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's Warp Pipes. For years, the Mario community has known about the infamous "Minus World" glitch - an infinitely-looping water level accessed by entering the Warp Zone in 1-2 in such a way that the zone doesn't fully load, and the pipes aren't set up yet to send you to the correct world and area. In the original Super Mario Bros., doing this and then entering the far left or right pipes sends players to a level designated "World -1", or Minus World. In The Lost Levels, this glitch was removed, with the pipes instead sending players to whatever destination is currently loaded into its memory. But if you enter the pipe while moving, the Warp Zone can load after you've entered, and you can trick the game to send you to the very beginning of the Area that the pipe wants to send you to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all pretty complicated, and honestly it's making my head spin too. Again, Kosmic's explanation is the best one, but the even shorter version is that using a combination of flags, axes, and pipes, you can manipulate the game into sending you into increasingly unhinged areas. You can force the game to load wacky stuff like World 2-5, 2-9, and so forth. And in The Lost Levels, quite specifically the Super Mario All-Stars edition, this weirdness is compounded by the fact that the game has save states accessible from the menu that will save your access to these weird worlds, but will load them in differently if you're accessing them from the menu instead of from the previous world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kosmic was able to combine all of this to start loading world after world beyond The Lost Levels' lettered bonus levels. First, from B-4, he made it to B-5, then B-6, 7, and 8. With some difficulty, he reached B-A, B-B, B-C, and B-D. Up to this point all these levels were largely just repeated versions of other levels, albeit with some occasional weirdness. But after B-D, it was unclear what was going to load.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer was B-E. At first, it just seemed sort of silly. Then, Mario briefly went to jail:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/after-39-years-new-mario-levels-discovered-2-1759871471928.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image via Kosmic on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The only way out was to save and quit. Kosmic escaped, headed to B-F, which started a series of repeat normal levels. From here, he went all the way to B-L, after which point a spring and a giant pit stopped him from playing further. But he could still load all these levels from the menu for different variations, and B-H resulted in this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/after-39-years-new-mario-levels-discovered-3-1759871614466.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image via Kosmic on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Things only got weirder from there:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/after-39-years-new-mario-levels-discovered-4-1759871643954.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image via Kosmic on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/after-39-years-new-mario-levels-discovered-6-1759871703915.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image via Kosmic on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, Kosmic found over 20 "new levels", which ranged from nearly identical to existing levels, to total messes like what you see above. Eventually, playing them just crashed Kosmic's game, and they're probably not that fun from a platforming perspective, but they were cool to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why did it take 39 years to find these levels? Kosmic has theories:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fewer people played Lost Levels compared to the first game. This trick is deep into the game, like in bonus worlds, not even in the main worlds. To see the full extent of the glitch, it only works on the All-Stars version, and it gets a bit technical...but the main reason I'd say is it's actually really hard."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kosmic demonstrates this in his videos. The most difficult part about it involves entering a pipe when the Warp Zone isn't fully loaded in, which requires being very precise with your movement as well as where the camera currently is. Some levels are easier to manipulate than others, but for this glitch to work there's one particularly tricky Warp Zone that Kosmic had to pull some very specific tricks to master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congrats to Kosmic and the entire Super Mario Bros. community, who now have a bag full of weird new levels to mess around with and the certainty that it's never too late to discover something new about a classic video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>If you're considering getting into VR gaming, the Meta Quest 3 and 3S are ideal starting points, thanks to their affordability and user-friendly all-in-one setups compared to other high-end VR headsets. For those who've recently purchased one of Meta's flagship VR devices (which also happen to be on sale right now), you can pick up several helpful Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessories at a discount thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Day</a>s event. The price cuts include upgraded headwear like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest Elite Strap</a> for $56 (was $70), and helpful components like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quest Link Cable</a> for $64 (was $80), which lets you connect the normally standalone headsets to your gaming PC.

That's why we recommend grabbing one of Meta's upgradable straps while they're on sale for Prime Big Deal Days. The base version of the Meta Quest Elite strap is just $56 during the sale (that's about $15 off the usual price), and brings enhanced, adjustable comfort to your headset thanks to its nifty dial that'll help you get a precise fit. It'll take some of the pressure off of your face, and comes with a silicone backing that cradles the back of your head. Just be aware that if you have a carrying case for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S, the headset won't fit inside while the Elite Strap is attached.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Meta Quest Elite Strap (with Battery)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$104 (was $130)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The upgraded version of the Meta Quest Elite Strap comes with a built-in battery pack that'll get you up to two hours of extra play time, which is probably worth it if you're planning on having multi-hour-long VR sessions (just beware of motion sickness).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes you just need an excuse to talk about a good game. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skin Deep</em></a><em> </em>is extremely good, and these patch notes are a good enough excuse.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote</a> about <em>Skin Deep</em>'s deft mix of slapstick humor and immersive sim clockwork level skulduggery earlier this year, but since then, it has come out, gained official mod support, and gone on sale. There’s also a new patch, which is illustrative of <em>Skin Deep</em>’s whole thing: systems interlocking with systems interlocking with systems to form an intricate latticework that occasionally freaks out and shocks everyone, including those who made it.</p><p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/derek-lieu.com/post/3m2k5276bws2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> by Derek Lieu, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">professional video game trailer editor</a> behind <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/derek-lieu.com/post/3ltujgaruyk2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skin Deep</em>’s own</a>, the game’s third major update includes some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/301280/view/498333631688738607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very enjoyable patch notes</a>. For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fixed: mech glass wound bug</strong></p><p>Piloting a mech and stepping on glass shards would sometimes result in getting glass stuck in Nina's feet. This was not intended, as Nina's feet are fictionally safe inside the mech. Using the mech to stomp on glass no longer applies glass wounds to Nina. Nina is now safe.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fixed: pod departure logic</strong></p><p>Under certain circumstances, the player was able to deposit all of the cats into the cat pod and then force the pod to leave before Nina could enter it. This resulted in what felt like a soft-lock where the pirate boarding ship never appeared.</p><p>Technically, the player was able to proceed by summoning another cat pod and entering it. However, this was confusing. So in this update, after a complete cat deposit, the cat pod is now not allowed to leave until the player has entered it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Additionally:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fixed: swordfish consumed by trash chute</strong></p><p>If the player had a swordfish impaled in their body and then stood near a trash chute, the trash chute sometimes "ate" the swordfish. This was not intended. It sort of made sense and was an interesting systemic behavior, but the interaction was a little too confusing. In this update, the trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And finally:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fixed: inaccessible keys inside laundry machine</strong></p><p>Throwing or dropping keys inside the laundry machine would sometimes result in the key no longer being accessible. There's an invisible "interaction cube" that surrounds each object, and the laundry machine's interaction cube was taking priority over keys' interaction cubes.</p><p>This was [a] delicate bug, as the interaction system is pretty complex and changing it at this point would potentially create other bugs. The fix chosen was for the laundry machine to eject/"poop out" the keys out of itself if the player climbs into the laundry machine.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This is what it’s all about. Don’t you want to insert yourself into that volatile ecosystem and see what chaos ensues? Of course you do. Just make sure to watch your step (unless you’re piloting a mech).</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-are-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-amazon-is-offering-entry-level-clearance-prices-2000632651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-4-are-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-amazon-is-offering-entry-level-clearance-prices.1319188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods 4 as their latest open-ear earbuds that sit outside your ear canal rather than sealing inside it like in-ear models. Compared to the newly launched AirPods Pro 3, the standard AirPods 4 cost three times less while the AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation come in at more than half the price. But those savings only apply if you snag them <strong>during Prime Big Deal Days on Amazon</strong>, where Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">can grab the standard version for $89 instead of $129</a>, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">upgrade to the ANC model for $119 down from $179</a>. You’re essentially getting premium Apple earbuds at budget earbud pricing.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Open-ear mode appeals to<strong> individuals who don’t like in-ear tips for longer wear times</strong> or prefer remaining attentive to their environments instead of switching between transparency modes. They sit comfortably in your outer ear, not pressing down nor giving that stuffed-up feeling sealed tips tend to produce. The new shape accommodates a broader geometry of ears compared to older AirPods, and fixes one of the largest gripes about prior versions falling off during exercise.</p>
<h2>High-End Features That Could Use a Refresh</h2>
<p>The H2 chip drives both models and offers huge upgrades compared to the H1 chip found in prior AirPods. The newer processor <strong>supports complex computational audio processing</strong>, which supports <strong>Advanced Audio and Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, both of which involve some serious real-time math. The H2 chip also enhances battery life, supporting the <strong>lengthy 30-hour total listening time</strong> if you count the charging case. The headphones themselves last about five hours per charge, and the case yields several additional charges before it itself must be recharged.</p>



<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio creates a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> which adds immersion to music, movies, and games. Head tracking is used to anchor sound to space so if your head moves when looking at a video, sound appears to remain affixed to your monitor rather than moving along with your head. Apple adjusts this setting per your actual ear geometry, gathered by your TrueDepth camera on your iPhone, for improved tailoring of the spatial effect for how your own ear shape affects perceived sound.</p>
<p>The ANC version implements <em>Active Noise Cancellation</em> which is impressive for an open-ear model. Standard ANC is optimized for sealed-in in-ear tips that quiet sound passively before it’s quieted electronically by the electronics. Apple designed a solution to actively cancel external sound even for an open-ear model by employing sophisticated algorithms and processing of the H2 chip. The payoff won’t be equivalent to AirPods Pro’s isolation, but it does a great job of cutting down on background sound in places like a coffee shop or bus/subway ride.</p>



<p>Transparency Mode allows you to easily discern what’s going on around you if you require awareness for sake of safety, for example, or for conversation. As opposed to just silencing your sound, Transparency Mode actually processes external sound so it’s normal-sounding but your music stays playing softly in the background.</p>
<p>Pairing with iPhone occurs automatically by way of Apple’s pairing process: Lift the case by your iPhone and a connection notice pops up automatically. Your AirPods then synchronize on all your Apple devices signed into a single iCloud account, switching automatically between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac as you transition between devices.</p>
<p>At $89 for the standard version and $119 for the model including ANC during Prime Big Deal Days, you’re getting Apple’s new earbud technology at prices comparable to generic Bluetooth earbuds. Those are all-time-low prices for getting high-end elements available without typical Apple markup.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft: Midnight is creeping closer, with an alpha test rolling out to select players over the last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">press previews now in the wild</a>, and plenty of interviews, Q&amp;As, and discussions revealing loads of new details about the upcoming expansion. As a part of that cycle, I was able to speak to four of the expansion's lead developers about...well, everything!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My interview with the team took place in two parts. In the first half, I spoke with design director Maria Hamilton and associate game director Paul Kubit. In the second half, I chatted with lead UX designer Crash Reed and senior game director Ion Hazzikostas. I had a <em>lot</em> of questions that could have been answered by either pair, so I ended up dividing them into topics and working through them as quickly and efficiently as possible across the two interviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For ease of reading and searching, I've mashed the two interviews together in this write-up, and sub-divided them by topic. The questions are mostly listed in the order I asked them so as to avoid removing context from the exchanges, but there are a few places where I reordered them just a bit so that questions along the same themes are placed together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something more succinct to read, you can check out the breakout stories from this interview of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-leads-say-the-worldsoul-saga-will-eventually-address-the-sword-of-sargeras-metzen-promised-and-metzen-doesnt-lie">what's going on with the Sword of Sargeras</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-is-seemingly-about-to-kill-the-games-biggest-mods">discussion of the controversial add-on changes in Midnight</a>. Otherwise, buckle up, because here's our Q&amp;A printed in full:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Locations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Let's start by talking about some of the new places. I was curious with the revamp of Silvermoon City, if there are any plans to revamp the Draenei Zones, Azuremyst Isle, Bloodmyst Isle, the Exodar.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Maria Hamilton:</strong> Right now, no, not for Midnight. We have the old versions of all of those places, including the original Silvermoon still, so that if you're doing questing in those areas, those all still exist, but no plans specifically for Midnight to do a reimagining of those areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Maybe sometime in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton</strong>: Never say never. We'd love to. This went very well. We weren't totally sure how a reimagining of a zone with this much nostalgia would go and so far so good. Seems like people are enjoying it and of course we're going to Northrend in The Last Titans, so that was important for us to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I've seen concerns from Alliance players about areas of Silvermoon being no-go zones for them and making them feel like they're maybe getting a lesser capital for this expansion. How do you respond to that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Two-thirds of Silvermoon is set aside as the neutral area where they're able to go. There's lots of space there and room for all of the services that we would normally expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's more that there are sections of what is a Horde city that ought to be for the Horde only and wanting to make sure that that's very clear. You get a warning, "Hey, you're not allowed in here," and then if you don't head back into the areas that are agreed upon, that's when the guards will come after you. And as soon as you enter the area, you're allowed to be back in again. They will drop threat and not chase you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I would say the area is actually very, very large. There's lots of space there. All of the needed things are there for a hub. And it felt like it does play very well into our story because increasingly, and you won't have seen this yet, as time goes by, through the course of the campaign, that relationship becomes increasingly tense and friction increases and increases and increases as the Army of Light, which was brought into to help against the onslaught is making its present felt and the Blood Elves are not responding well to that presence in their city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was also important to the story that we build it in this way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It feels like an ongoing challenge for you all. I mean it's not just storytelling, trying to balance Alliance and Horde, but also trying to make sure that the gameplay itself has that balance intact.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paul Kubit</strong>: It's a challenge that it also has comes with its own benefits too. One of the great parts about World of Warcraft is the cultures that are within it, and the Horde and Alliance are a huge part of it and despite the fact that the Horde and Alliance aren't actively warring against one another right now as they have been in the not-too-distant past, there's still those tensions. There's still those reasons to hop into PvP modes. There's still those reasons to ask questions about, can the Alliance even enter this space, and also gives us some really cool texture to build our housing places in the form of Razorwind Shores and Founder's Point.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Delves</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It was really cool to see delves come back for this expansion. What worked about delves in The War Within that led you to keep them around, as opposed to some other smaller group content that we've seen in the past? I'm thinking specifically of scenarios and island expeditions.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> I think that with Delves we were looking at a way to provide content that was relatively predictable in terms of how long it would take, and what the challenges would be. We were looking at sort of that, slightly more casual folks who want to not be worried about a timer or worried about people waiting on them. They need to go walk the dog real fast. They got to deal with a baby or a kid or something. And they should be able to stand up and walk away and go do that and not leave their group upset or wondering what happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a lot of players really responded to having that different pace and that different feel for content. It just provided us a sort of a different experience, and folks that that's their thing. They really enjoyed it and we wanted to make sure that we expanded more in those areas to make sure those players are having a good time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Yeah, I'll add on to that. I think a lot of the reason that we were able to see success with Delves is, no feature in World of Warcraft stands on its own. We're all standing on the shoulders of previous features which have come before them. And so we've learned all sorts of lessons about dynamic spawning and having creatures spawn in interesting in different ways each time from features like Torghast. The ability for creatures, the enemies to scale not just by the size of your group, but also the composition of your group because a group of five DPS plays very differently than a group with three DPS, a healer and a tank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you want to have those groups have similar challenges without having to worry about, we have to have a tank, or we have to not have a tank, they're all just going to have a similar difficulty. Previous things like the Horrific Visions gave us that tech. We got tech from Islands in terms of additional procedural spawning techniques and so on. And so, this is one of the reasons that Delves were able to take off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think the other was just planning ahead to say that this is going to be an evergreen feature. This is not intended to be a War Within feature where it's just going to be narrowly focused on a particular fantasy, but it's a little bit more like, no, these are just a dungeon-like experience with scalable difficulty, scalable group size, and a companion who follows along and powers up along the way. That was a broad enough structure that it allowed us to not just have it stick in The War Within, but carry it forward to Midnight and beyond.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I've seen the overview of how Valeera works as a Delve companion. It seems like she obviously has some different abilities than Brann, but it seems like broadly speaking she's not like a drastic change-up from Brann. Does that feel accurate to say?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> I think so. Yeah. So the differences you'll see are she takes things a little bit more seriously, she's more stabby, and also she's going to start with all three specs. So with Brann we started with healer and DPS and then only added in tank along the way. We think that was a good addition and one that a lot of folks choose to take advantage of depending on what class or spec they play and bring into delves, and so she'll be able to take from the get go as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton</strong>: We also added a storyline for her that she will unlock as you play through Delves and you'll learn a bit more about her over time, which we think will add to your ability to get to know your companion. You may not ever end up being best buds like you might feel you could be with Brann, but at least you'll better understand her and her motivations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have there been any improvements made to the companion AI for Valera? Is she going to run through packs of unpulled monsters to try and get me killed?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> This is something we're looking at for sure. We always want to continue to build up the AI of the creatures that you're playing the game alongside. And so yeah, this is something we're looking at.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She'll have the benefit of being a rogue too, so she may be a little less detectable than Brann was. And, "Don't stand there!" She'll be a little bit more subtle in her interactions, and so I think that will natively help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think on a broader spectrum, so I know this isn't exactly what you asked, but we're working on making the game-controlled companions a lot smarter and easier to build in our game. And this is right now taking form in the training grounds, which is our PvP training feature where the bots or game controlled opponents that you have there are built in an entirely new way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're actually players underneath the hood as opposed to being monsters, and what that means is that it's easier for our designers to update them as we get new spells for paladins or rogues, et cetera, and easier for them to show what gear they're wearing. They don't have to require as much update, and so those types of updates, and making our bots a little bit smarter and easier to make are going to continue to bleed through into things like your companions and Delves, or your companions and follower dungeons or story mode raids and things like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Yeah. I want to add, I'm sorry, I have to add a Brann quote. I'm sorry. Just my personal favorite has to be after pulling those four packs into you, then after we've died, letting us know that we should probably use harder-hitting moves. So I think we're going to have slightly different kinds of feedback from her, so it should feel different.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Demon Hunters and Other Classes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So you're adding Void Elves to the races that can play Demon Hunters. Again, talking about faction balance, is there any chance of seeing another Horde race join Demon Hunters at some point in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> So we have sort of winkingly said that the World Soul Saga is only just now entering its second chapter of three. There's plenty of opportunities for the story to go in different and interesting directions. The story just now took us into a place where the Void Elves were given access to the ability to be a Demon Hunter. Who knows where the story will take us in the future? It might not necessarily be a Demon Hunter, but we do want to at least make sure that we even out the Horde-Alliance balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why give a new spec to Demon Hunters specifically? Why not another DPS class, or why notexpand on support classes after Augmentation Evoker, or anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> A big reason here is this is where the story took us, as we're working to fight against the Void and getting really close to the Void powers in particular. That's an interesting cosmic power to work with when it comes to class design. We don't have a whole lot of classes which use the Void. Shadow Priest is pretty much it right now in terms of using that force. And also Demon Hunters just happened to have two specs and were our only class who had two specs coming up to this point, and so there's always been a feeling that there's an opportunity for growth there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so there was a really cool confluence of story opportunity as well as class design opportunity for the Demon Hunters to do what they do, which is sacrifice everything and take the enemy's own power and use it against them in ways that they wouldn't expect. In this case, it just doesn't happen to be Fel, it happens to be sparkly, purple, cosmic Void energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is that normally how it flows, like story first, to decide what new classes or races or whatever else is joining, or does it go the other way where it's like, okay, well we need this to balance out everything that we have, how can we fit it into the story?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> I mean I think it is both, but we do lean to the when, not the what as much as when. If it doesn't make sense with the story that we're telling, it's very hard to just jam something in there. And so, we also have to look at, as Ian talked about, we have to look at carrying costs going forward as well. So, as much fun as it would be to add lots of new races and lots of new class animations and things, we have to think about what does that mean for the future? Ideally, there is a good strong story support for those choices, but there is also balance considerations, and Demon Hunters only having two specs was also something. Right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So you're saying if I wait long enough for a Maelstrom-focused expansion, I can get Shaman Tanks.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> That's possible. I don't see why not.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Housing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay. Housing. So my understanding is, if I earn a cosmetic from an achievement, I'll get that for the house, a cup or whatever. I can then purchase more of those cups for currency from some vendor because I got it through an achievement. But there are other ones where I have to repeat content over and over again if I want a second cup, a third cup, a fourth cup. Is that correct? Am I understanding that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> That's by and large, accurate. Yeah, I think and it's going to be defined by the type of unlock that you have. If it's an achievement, then by definition, you can't earn achievements more than once on an account, and so you'll get your first cup, using cups as an example from that achievement, and then others will be backfilled from a vendor. Whereas if something is, say, crafted by a profession, then there would not be a vendor for backfills after you've purchased your first one or crafted your first one, you would just craft more of them or have a guildmate or a friend acquaintance craft more of them for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What about stuff that's not tied to achievements? Say it's killing a boss in a dungeon. If I want four cups to sit on my table, do I have to go kill that boss four times? Am I locked out every week from loot? How does that work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit</strong>: I actually don't know the specifics on dungeons. But we do want to make sure that that act of, if it happens to be something which drops from a dungeon boss, is not something that's going to be a frustrating experience. By and large, a lot of these drops that drop from bosses are just going to be guaranteed a hundred percent drop. So you defeat them and then you get the item, and so that'll make it much more so that you don't have to hope for that 1% drop. Especially if this is dropping from a boss that you might've been grinding for a mount for several months, if not years prior, and just got that mount now have to go back and start grinding that same boss for a chair or a cup or whatnot. That would be a frustrating experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're putting these in such a way that we want to avoid those feels bad moments of I want the thing, but I can't get it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When I log in for the first time on December 2nd when housing drops, am I just going to suddenly find myself with a bunch of stuff from all the different achievements that I've unlocked in the past?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Based on my understanding of how much World of Warcraft you've played? I think the answer is yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wow. Called out! Okay, awesome. So I love the dye system. I was messing around with that in the alpha. Any chance we're ever going to get armor dyes since the housing dyes work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> I think you're my twin, because these are all things I have said. Ooh, could I dye my armor? Oh my God, this is great. What's this technology limitation? Can we do this? Obviously we are looking into what we can do with the dye system and what's possible and what's involved. It was one of my first ideas to, it's not something for Midnight. We won't have that at launch and I can't promise it's going to happen, because we need our engineers who are brilliant to come up with brilliant engineer answers, but yeah, same thing I thought too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Arcantina</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me about the Arcontina. How do you get to it? Where is it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> You will unlock it after journeying with Arator and you will learn about it and that it's existed for some time and who has had access to it previously. It is an extra-dimensional, arcane space that is wherever that is, and you will access it through going to that arcane place using, I believe it's an item right now. We'll see if it remains an item, but essentially you can go to it once you've unlocked it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yeah, it's a place for folks that need to kick back and relax and get a little bit of respite from the day to day. It's an arcane cantina so that it's not in the world where it can be bothered. You'll find lots of lesser-known characters visiting there. Most of them are war-weary folks, both Horde and Alliance. Often having a drink and a chat with somebody who might've been their enemy in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was important to us that we talk to our veterans who work on the team and get their feedback on this and get their feedback on what kinds of conversations and language are appropriate and reasonable and really used that to help inform what you get to overhear, what kind of stories you get to hear, and what it is that these folks are asking you to do for them in questing. What is important to them, what would they like you to go do? So it's a space that should be fun for people. It's intended to be social. There's room for role players, multiple rooms in the place, so yeah.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw Gamon in the trailer and everything, but it feels like a really good opportunity for cameos of characters we haven't seen in a long time or I saw you can get quests there, opportunities to go back and explore old content, is that kind of what you're thinking?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Yep, exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Gamon is a great example. The type of character you might see in there as well, someone who is known and interesting, but also just has the vibe of being an old soldier who needs to come back to the Arcantina every once in a while and grab a cup of brew and talk to some other old soldiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned it's really good for role players. How difficult is it going to be to encounter other players in the Arcantina?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Yeah, I think we're looking at the sharding numbers to determine when we instance shard, but the intent is that there's enough room and space there that we do allow groups of people to get in there. I don't know what we're going to set the maximum at yet. It'll be something it'd be good to see over the course of the alpha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit: </strong>Yeah, think on the order of order halls. There were shared spaces. They're not crowded crowded, but you're going to run into other folks when you're in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did I see correctly that the Brawler's Guild is coming back? Is that real?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> We don't talk about the Brawler's Guild very often. As you look through the game files that are datamineable within Midnight, you may see some changes to the Brawler's Guild, where season names are changing and things like that and interesting items and monsters are appearing in the database. We suggest you don't pay too much attention to what's going on there. Wink, wink.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dungeons</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know you guys have talked about what dungeons to expect, what ones are going to be in the mythic rotation. As far as Timewalking goes, are we eventually going to see Shadowlands Timewalking during the rotation in Midnight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Yeah, we're going to continue building Timewalking up to catch up over time, not at the launch of Midnight. This is typically the type of thing that happens in those smaller intermediate patches as you'll see Timewalking updates. But our plan is to continue to support Timewalking. There's a lot of folks who really like the gameplay and efficient rewards that come from Timewalking, as well as just cool opportunities to get old reps that you might've missed out on and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you also thinking about potentially adding other Timewalking raids to the pool as well?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. This is something that we continue to look at. We had a lot of folks who really enjoyed engaging with the Blackrock raid that was a part of the 20-year celebration, and so that wasn't necessarily a Timewalking raid, but that was one that we saw a lot of folks playing with. So as we look to build Timewalking raids in the future, we're going to look at what folks had the most fun playing with, and then go from there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are your plans around raid buffs, especially in Mythic+? I know there's some concerns that you have to have certain classes to bring to Mythic+ or whatever, or your group's not going to be complete. Are you removing buffs, nerfing them, adding more? What are you doing?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: Hunters have noticed that Hunter's Mark now increases damage taken by all forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, Hunters got a raid buff!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> At long last. Yeah, I think raid buffs serve the purpose of, in raids, ensuring that the best raid composition is a balanced one. Ultimately, I think players play all classes. You want everyone to feel like they have a home in the raid groups that get formed. If you're a leader of a pickup group, forming a group, ideally if you don't have a Warlock or you don't have a Hunter or you don't have a Death Knight, you should be looking for one of those classes, and accordingly providing a home to a player in search of a group, rather than just trying to stack whatever you perceive the flavor of the month best damage dealer to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But conversely though, in dungeons, of course, you can't have all of those present, so our approach there is to make sure that there aren't specific ones that feel like they have an outsized impact, where they're going to overshadow the others and limit composition diversity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think we're in a pretty good place there, honestly. It is natural that if you have a couple of classes that are buffing magical damage, let's say, that may push you towards wanting a caster or magic damage dealer as your third, and vice versa for physical damage. But those sorts of synergies are fine as long as there's room for both magic heavy and physical heavy players in groups, broadly speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, we're looking at representation and want to make sure that no matter what class you play, you have a home in the groups that are being formed, and if we're seeing stats starting to skew away from that, we're going to make some changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What about helping motivate more people, not just to queue as tank and healer, but just to play tank and healer in the first place?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Yeah, that is absolutely a goal. There's different factors that come into play there. I think as we've seen in the past when we add, let's say a new healer spec or a new tank specialization, that doesn't necessarily increase the total number of people playing those roles. It just often has people switch from one healer spec to a new one to try it out. Because a lot of it is, it's not a unique phenomenon to World of Warcraft, as you are no doubt aware from a wide range of games. Turns out that damage is a more popular role than tank or support, whether you are playing Overwatch, whether you're playing whatever. And that is something we're trying to work around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But one approach for us is to also look at the things that can make those roles intimidating and see how we can lower some of those barriers. For healers, a lot of the combat approachability changes that we're doing and some of the UI improvements are hopefully aimed at making the pace of healing a bit more manageable and the number of tools that healers have to manage against something that is less reliant on add-ons to build yourself a dashboard, to give you all the real-time information that you need to make all these split-second decisions, and maybe something that can be a bit more manageable where you're responding to the situations that are unfolding in front of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With tanks, I think we have more work to do. I mean, part of the reality is in Dungeons in particular socially and community-wise, the Tanks are seen as the leaders of the group and there's an expectation that the routes, you know exactly where to move, and that's not necessarily something that we designed that way, but it is what the community expectation has come to be, and what people will ask of their tank. And so still thinking through how we can improve just the tools there that we offer players, to maybe reduce that barrier to entry, but we know we have more work to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, I've seen some interesting suggestions for that around UI, like suggested routing for tanks that could be turned on and off.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I mean, I think we're always hesitant to prescribe our suggested route, because inevitably the community will figure out a different one than ours and then we're just adding confusion. It's like, "Oh, no, no, you're following the Blizzard line. That's the wrong way to do it. You're supposed to do this other thing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You'd also be essentially admitting that parts of your dungeon are not part of the intended way or whatever.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Exactly, and we're often designing dungeons that are deliberately meant to be approached by any one of four or five different paths depending on whether you have stealth in your group, depending on just what you're more comfortable with. We're hesitant to, we know that players always want to distill challenges down to a single solution, but ultimately if we do that for them, we are robbing players of a key part of the gameplay. So it's a complicated problem space, but it's definitely one that we haven't abandoned, one that we continue to talk about a lot.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/wow-midnight-gamescomreveal-eversong-woods-006-1755532843547.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Raids and Gearing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm seeing some frustration in the community from the announcement that we won't have the ability to unlock armor appearances from different tiers of content via upgrades. So for instance, right now, if I clear a raid, if I get a tier set on heroic with my guild, if I upgrade it high enough, I also unlock the mythic appearance and my understanding is that's going away in Midnight. Why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> We saw this feedback too, so this is something that we're just continuing to talk with the team about. This is why we go to alpha and share information early as opposed to our alpha being the victory lap. Take a look at the game before it's out. Like, no, we're still actively working on the game and will be for the next several weeks and months, and so I would say this is the type of feedback we're looking forward for and we're going to talk about it internally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Will all three Midnight Raids at launch open at the same time and drop the same item level loot, or is there sort of an intended progression?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> They will not open all at the same time. The Void Spire and Dream Rift Raids will both be open when the season starts, and then the March on Quel'Danas raid will probably open a couple of weeks later or so, and kind of pick up where Void Spire left off. I think the contents of that raid narratively follow from the events at Void Spire, and so if you want to view it as the conclusion of the tier after giving players a chance to experience the first seven bosses, first six bosses elsewhere, then that's one way of looking at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In the past, this has not been true for every expansion, but there has been generally a cadence of three major patches, one raid per patch, with occasional anomalies here and there. Is this another anomaly or is there maybe an expectation that we might start seeing you guys playing with different raid instances, different numbers of bosses in the future, per patch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Yeah, I think it is a signal that we are looking to deviate from being formulaic a little bit, and play around with structure. We'd like to get back to these one boss and Onyxia-style raids to give people flexibility in their schedules. But as always, we're going to see how the community responds to it, what the pros and cons are, and that's going to shape our plans going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I think when it comes to most things in WoW, we try to avoid being too formulaic and too repetitive. A couple of exceptions, we're probably going to keep having eight dungeons in a Mythic plus season. That's a good number.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What about like patch X.5 mini raids, like Trial of Valor or Crucible of Storms? Is that also just sort of on the table in the air somewhere, maybe?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Things like that I think are definitely on the table, just as we've experimented with introducing mega-dungeons in those intermediate patches. I think a small raid could also serve the same general purpose. Yeah, we want to stay flexible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any plans for changing how tier sets work or thoughts on feedback around them? Any plans to balance the tokens, ahem, pallypriestshaman?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> No current major plans. That's not to say that nothing will change between now and Midnight launch. I think that when it comes to the structure of our seasons, that's something that we really work on very iteratively and almost in real time. I think if there were things that we wanted to change about how Mythic Plus works, or how sets work or whatever, we honestly would've just done those in War Within season three, which has been in development in parallel to Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've been focused on the content in a lot of ways on Midnight, but when it comes to some of the systems, how the season's going to play out, we're looking at learning lessons from how season three of War Within is unfolding on the live servers, how people are feeling about that. And that will inform changes that we make during beta, let's say, as we prepare to launch Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How are you feeling about the place that loot is at right now, especially in raids? Any chance we're ever going to go back to personal loot in LFR?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I think that's possible. The current structure, there are some technical and general clarity advantages to having loot work in a single way across all raid difficulties, as opposed to differently in one of them from the others. But the feedback is not lost on us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think a hope that we have is that the change to transmog rules will change how LFR Loot acquisition plays out. Broadly speaking, right now a ton of people are in LFR who have better gear who don't need the items, but they have to do it and have to roll on it if they want to collect the appearances. As of Midnight, if you have a higher level appearance, you'll automatically learn the appearances from the lower tiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so ideally people are all in Raid Finder because they want the gear from raid finder, and that should be a more equitable situation where people are competing for loot.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Add-ons</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How are you addressing button bloat? How are you working to reduce the number of buttons that need to be on-screen at a time?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kubit:</strong> Yeah. I'll actually say that there are not any specific efforts in Midnight which are aimed directly at button bloat. We are taking a pretty big stab at combat approachability, and in some cases that may end up meaning fewer buttons, but we are taking a pretty holistic view of all of the 40 specs in the game and identifying places where to play that spec either at a baseline level, or in cases at a competitive level, requires you to understand a lot of information, requires you to manage a lot of information. There are certain rotations which make you feel like you need to have an add-on in order to play that class effectively. We identify Outlaw Rogue as one of these with the roll the bones mechanic as being something which is very mathematically difficult to hold that information in your head while you're trying to dodge the fire, and things like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of classes which had a large number of buffs, either on themselves or debuffs their enemies, that required management and maintenance and over time and a lot of buttons, which maybe just were used to power up other buttons and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're looking at classes from that point of view and trying to make them more approachable, and in some cases that may end up being meaning that you have fewer buttons at the end of the day, but reducing button count isn't necessarily a goal. We also do have, this is not a new feature to Midnight, but there's a one button rotation which was added in 11.1.7, which is a fantastic accessibility feature in and of itself, separate from the approachability efforts that we have now. This is a way to play the game, just to focus a little less on maximizing your throughput by playing your class perfectly, and just playing your class at an acceptable level. And spending more time enjoying the scenery, enjoying the gameplay, relaxing, focusing on a second screen, doing whatever, maybe learning a new class or learning a new spec, playing your alts during a cosmetic weekend when mounts drop at a higher rate and things like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a way to solve some of those problems that you might be hitting on when you're saying button load is an issue. If managing that level of dexterity is something that isn't your cup of tea, then that might be an option to explore as well.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/midnight-gameplay-reveal-world-of-warcraft-1759867586627.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, add-ons. I don't want to totally rehash the reasons why you're making the changes you are making. But why announce the deactivation of combat data add-on APA... Whatever technical words, without allowing time for players to mess around with the actual in-house Blizzard updates first? Because I feel like a lot of people are mad, but they haven't seen what you're offering yet.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I mean, I would argue that the next few months are that opportunity to mess around with all of these things. We are in week one of our alpha test, with several weeks of alpha to follow and then beta. I mean this is a cut over that I think needs to happen with an expansion rollout. It's not something we could ever do mid-expansion. I think it's important that we are able to build an entire tier of dungeons and raids, all of that in this world. That we're able to design our classes for this world rather than changing expectations out from under people while they're in the, accustomed to doing existing content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think we've tried to be as transparent as possible about what some of the upcoming UI improvements were. We've had many of them rolled out during War Within to begin getting feedback that we could already incorporate as players are seeing in the Midnight alpha today. And we're going to be paying very close attention in the weeks and months to come to make sure that we land this in a way that's really satisfying to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also have invited a bunch of our add-on authors to alpha alongside everyone else so that they can start giving us feedback on collateral damage that's unintended, things that we can change in our implementation to make their lives easier, to make players' lives easier, and just make sure that we're getting all the feedback that we need ASAP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crash Reed: </strong>Because to add to that, honestly, we want to keep this an open dialogue. This is something that we want to have players continue to keep giving that information. We're already getting a flood of it now. I mean you're seeing the changes we're making to the cooldown manager based on that feedback. That was the whole reason to launch it early so that we could, this is what we think it should be. Obviously it didn't have everything attached to it, but we had enough there just to get the dialogue going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We want to change the way that we're engaging with this so that it's very, very open and players are getting their hands on things very, very early so that we can react to that feedback and this gives us that time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For people who maybe don't have access to the alpha or won't have access to the beta, who are seeing all this pop up on Wowhead or whatever and are kind of freaking out, what do you tell them? Like, I am obviously in the alpha, but I like having DBM air horn at me when I'm standing in poop. I use Weak Auras as kind of a midway point between the one-button rotation and nothing, to tell me what's going on with my procs and Maelstrom  So for someone who's in that vicinity who's really freaked out that this is going to lock them out of raiding, what do you say to them to reassure them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reed:</strong> So you're in luck, the cooldown manager very soon will have sound alerts. We're looking at them right now, so just going over the very large list of them sound alerts are going into the cooldown manager. You will be able to assign sounds to the various things like on cooldown when it's available, a various subset of things that you'll be able to assign that to. The list is quite a robust list of sounds that you'll be able to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And going into talking about the boss warnings, that also will have a robust set of sounds as things are moving through. Our sound team will be putting things on something that's like deadly versus something that's normal, so you'll be able to hear the distinction between these as they're moving down that list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, right now the sounds aren't there so it doesn't have them, but that is just for the alpha. The sounds will be there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Philosophically, and just to be clear, I know there are many, many players who share your exact perspective and use add-ons in the same way and have the same concerns. Ultimately, if you are standing in something that is lethal and is going to kill your character, and the only way that you are aware of that fact is because you have an air horn that's playing from an add-on, we have dropped the ball as developers. And that should be on us to fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ideally, we should have been getting feedback loud and clear of like, "I just keep dying. This is super frustrating. I don't know what to do about it, and I'm going to stop playing if you don't fix this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Purple fire on purple ground.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Yeah, well, yes, and we should stop doing red on red and purple on purple, and that feedback has been very well noted. I mean we've also continued to make visual effects improvements as we rolled out during War Within, with much crisper edges on things like this isn't just a UI effort, it's not just an encounter design effort, it's combat design. It's our artists, it's our sound team, it's everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To ultimately take away this crutch that we have been leaning on to some extent we're players who haven't been using these tools, have honestly been playing a game, a version of the game that was in some ways unfair. We want to level the playing field, and ensure that everyone has the information at their disposal as part of the base experience that they need to succeed. And from a philosophical perspective as we approach difficulty tuning, our goal is for difficulty to be the same as it used to be. If your guild is accustomed to taking, I don't know, X weeks to get ahead of the curve, or to clear normal, or Mythic or whatever tier you're doing, it should be roughly that same amount of time. You should spend the same number of hours or wipes to learn a boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just, ideally the things that are being tested are going to be more a product of coordinating, collaborating with your teammates and understanding, solving the puzzle of the encounter in a way that is this unique MMO PvE gameplay, as opposed to forcing us to test Twitch reaction times because there are a few other things that we can do that add-ons won't solve. Or forcing, or players, as many people grumble about spending a bunch of time configuring WeakAuras or figuring out who has theirs improperly set up so that the raid assignment thing works correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not what raiding should be about. Ideally it's about the gameplay playing the mechanics, but at the end of the day, again, as I said, part of why we're rolling this out with the new expansion, part of why we have our first raid encounter available for testing in the first week of alpha, is to make sure that we're getting all the data we need to tune the experience appropriately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If maybe people need a couple more seconds to react to something and get into position, or there shouldn't be quite as many of this debuff or this mechanic going out at the same time for it to be reasonable from a cognitive load perspective for a group of humans who aren't using assistance to help manage that load. But at the end of the day, our goal is just to create fun encounters that are challenging people the way they're accustomed to being challenged that still feel really satisfying to overcome, and I think we're confident that we have a path to get there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/07/midnight-gameplay-reveal-world-of-warcraft-2-1759867605653.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Everything Else</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So it looks like hero talents are back. Obviously there are many changes to all the classes, but I guess in shape, roughly the same as they have been in War Within. What do you feel worked and didn't work with that system, in a manner that allowed you to bring it back in the same way?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I think overall, I think we're happy with how the system has played out. I think that some of the original goals of the system were to give players meaningful power progressions, some new fantasies to access without having too much complexity. And I think that was the value in ultimately making sure that you get all of your hero talent tree and you're just making one binary swap between them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our specs and classes have a bunch of combinatorial complexity already. We don't feel like we need to add too much more of that, even for our pretty advanced players. That same sort of philosophy is actually what motivated our approach to Apex talents and how we are treating talents in Midnight as well. We're not looking to just give you 10 new points to spend anywhere and have exponential complexity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In many cases, the trees have strong class fantasies. Things like Dark Ranger or the like, that players were excited to be able to access. I think some of the more challenging aspects were four specializations that have very different play styles. Coming up with a single cohesive tree that felt like it could serve both of them well, could be a challenge at times. Some worked better than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In evaluating the health of the system, we look at basically diversity. If there are cases where there's pretty much a one-to-one mapping of everyone who plays this spec picks this option out of their two available hero talent trees, we see that as unhealthy. And so those are the ones that tended to see much more change going into Midnight full redesigns in a couple of cases. Ideally, everyone feels like both are viable for at least some of the content they prefer doing. But yeah, all in all, I think we're happy with how the system has played out in War Within, and that's why we're continuing it on into Midnight and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So we've had the Delve Belt, we've had the Reshii Wraps, we've had the special boots that only drop from, I think it's Soul Hunters in 11.2. And so now we've got three slots basically that are taken up by one thing that you have to get, and then every other boot drop or belt drop you get is useless. Are you going to do this again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Not in that form and not with that amount of density over the same couple of successive patches. We are aware that that is far from ideal. I think, taking a step back, part of why the belt exists, for example, is we understand players partways into a season, we're often pretty well saturated on gear rewards, and so it's hard to, if we have new content, we have some new system that we're dropping in a dot seven, we're trying to find a reward that's going to be interesting and motivating to a wide range of players. And just saying, "Okay, here's a standard piece of myth gear or whatever" isn't going to do it for a lot of folks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, making one of these alternate types of items, whether it's, you know, Cyrce's Circlet or the belt most recently, is a way of cutting across all play styles, all tiers of difficulty of content people are engaging in, and making something that can be interesting. Now, when we do that too often we're basically killing gear slots and that clashes with the rest of our itemization going into the next season. We're discussing taking a different approach to solving those sorts of problems in Midnight. It's a bit early to talk about it just yet. It's not really going to come into play until we get later on into the patches in Midnight, but I can promise that we're not going to see multiple slots monopolized by those sorts of items going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're clearly trying to reduce add-on use in-game, to make the game more playable across the board for everybody out of the box. Does that lead or does anything lead to plans eventually for a console launch in the future, mobile? Would you ever put the game on Steam? Is there any thought about branching out?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Nothing to announce in that direction. This is mostly just around getting the years of feedback. All the things that we talked about in the past of making sure that everyone has a even playing field coming in. But it's also just taking in the slew of accessibility requests that have come in over the years, and just making sure that high information players who are playing mythics, dungeons and everything have what they need. But also players who want to go out in the world or reduce things or move things around to customize for their needs, that we have a slew of all of that available just like we did with edit mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the next implementation of that and we plan to continue evolving the UI beyond this once the set is done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know you don't share subscriber numbers anymore, but can you offer any idea of how World of Warcraft is doing now in terms of players when compared to past expansions, like Wrath or Dragonflight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Yeah, we don't share subscriber numbers. I can say, I think the game is in a very, very healthy place. I think that we've seen stronger retention over the course of Dragonflight and War Within previous expansions. And I think our content cadence and frequent updates have really resonated well with players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wide range of content that we're offering, especially things like delves for solo players, really holding onto and capturing the interest of players who often ran out of things to do pretty quickly once they hit max level and then realized they didn't want to do dungeons or raids. So I think we're really happy with where the game is overall and incredibly excited for this next chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>At what point does WoW become too top-heavy? I know I ask you this every couple of years. When do you move on to WoW 2? Is the Worldsoul Saga something that might serve like a good bridge? Is this ever something that could happen?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I'd argue we're about to release WoW 11 or WoW 12, I guess. It's the 11th expansion. Yeah. I think it's hard to imagine, right? I think we constantly are reinventing and updating core pieces of the game. It's a little bit of a Ship of Theseus approach to how the game is built at this point. And if you look at the differences between the classic anniversary realms and War Within today, oh my gosh, they are very, very, very, very different games. And in many cases appeal to different audiences. And that's awesome because they're all part of this greater Azeroth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yeah, I think we're also not just touching endgame, we are doing things like updating our new player experience, updating our new UI, updating our returning player experience, to make sure the people who didn't play War Within or who've been away for a while can quickly get caught up both mechanically and story-wise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we know that it's equally important to keep drawing in new players as well as just serving the core that we have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think I'm out of time so I'm going to sneak in this last one. When are we going to </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-leads-say-the-worldsoul-saga-will-eventually-address-the-sword-of-sargeras-metzen-promised-and-metzen-doesnt-lie">deal with the big sword</a><strong>?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas and Reed, in unison:</strong> What sword?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. Okay.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Before the Worldsoul Saga is over.

              <p><span>In a move that sounds custom-made to tick every box of your parents’ SEO, Jimmy Fallon is producing a </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> game show. Is that not just </span><i><span>Wheel of Fortune</span></i><span>, you ask? I mean, yeah, kinda.</span></p> <p><span>If you somehow haven’t heard of </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, it started as a browser-based word game in 2021, which blew up so fast that </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">The</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">New York Times</a></span></i><span>‘ games section acquired it in 2022. Now it’s the centerpiece of the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span>’ much more high-profile gaming offerings, and it has inspired hundreds of copycat games. The premise is simple: the player has to guess a five-letter word in up to six attempts, with correct letters being marked green or yellow, depending on if they’re in the right spot or not. It’s a simple brain teaser that is easy to pick up and put down every day, so its virality is easy to understand. The question is: How will Fallon and company expand this into a full-blown game show?</span></p>   <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> reports that the series, if picked up, will air on NBC, and would give Fallon yet another gig on the network to go along with his hosting of </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, the reality series </span><i><span>On Brand</span></i><span>, and the musical game program </span><i><span>That’s My Jam</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span> anchor Savannah Guthrie is signed on to host the </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> pilot. The show is filming in the UK thanks to Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog production company, and that’s about all we know right now. Is it just going to be guests solving five-letter word puzzles like those in the existing game? That doesn’t sound like quite enough for a full-fledged game show, so I expect there will be more to it than that. Will the players who end up on the show spell out the words “Authoritarian Regime”? </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>Probably not on Fallon’s watch</span></a><span>.

              <p>More games are coming out than ever before. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-19-000-new-games-limited-pc-valve-unplayed-80-1851738322">Over 18,000 separate store listings</a> were added to Steam in 2024 alone. Our list of notable October releases hit 55, and there were dozens more games we could have included. It’s a good thing that with the market so flooded, the average gamer is also buying tons of games. Oh wait, they aren’t! A new survey by Circana finds the majority of players in the U.S. buy just two games a year or fewer.</p> <p>That data point was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">shared last week</a> (via <em><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/sept-2025s-top-new-steam-and-console?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=7owge&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjkxOTExOCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTc1NDM3NzY3LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NjIyODQsImV4cCI6MTc2MjQ1NDI4NCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE0MDg5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.P7-FDk_km-Lb5u7RkPNCSLloq8feyciLH5rCuGYy4ew&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">GameDiscoverCo</a></em>) by the firm’s head of gaming research, Mat Piscatella. The group’s upcoming Future of Games report for the last quarter asked respondents how often they purchased new games. A whopping third said they don’t even buy one a year. Only 4 percent purchase more than one game a month. Did you buy <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and<em> Borderlands 4</em> in September? Congratulations: you are a statistical outlier.</p>

 <p>Piscatella was presenting the data in the context of the recent Game Pass price hikes. While most players barely buy games at all, a small fraction of them spend a ton. “Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non-free-to-play gaming space,” he wrote. We can imagine this as the group who’s going to buy every game on their most-anticipated list no matter what. In fact, they might even buy the Deluxe Edition.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27zezw2ek2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtnlcxloqjvmbylrdg2jzzq4x6qlon6az44xwjvfajx6viqo7h3m"> <p lang="en">Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space.</p> <p>According to Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games, only 4% of US video game players buy a new game more often than once per month, with a third of players not buying any games at all.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">2025-10-02T16:54:18.096Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>You can see this in the recent financial data for gaming companies like Sony. Despite console adoption stalling, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">they keep making more profit</a> on the same existing slice of fans. While some people buy a Switch 2, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S and only ever buy a handful of games for it, others are content to keep adding to their backlog, a niche concept as foreign to the average gamer as the Criterion closet is to most people who subscribe to Netflix.</p>

 <p>We often think of the gaming as, broadly speaking, evenly divided and homogenous. We take the median player and imagine an entire audience made up of them, as opposed to the market being defined by lots of different groups of players with unique habits, tastes, and conceptions of the hobby. It’s also easy to see why game studios have gotten so precious about release windows. If the majority of people are only going to buy a couple of games of year, best not to go head-to-head with <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, or the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p> <p>One obvious solution to this problem? Better curation and discovery. There’s only too many games if you can’t help the right people find the right ones. Valve has put a lot of work into exploring that problem and Steam is still far from perfect. The rest of the platforms, sadly, aren’t even close. And mobile, the biggest platform of all, is the worst of the bunch.</p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is celebrating its first anniversary this Friday with a surprise livestream and hinting at a mysterious special message.</p>



<p>Released last year, Atlus’ Metaphor: ReFantazio is the newest IP from the minds behind Persona 5. Under Studio Zero, the JRPG took players to a medieval fantasy world with incredible turn-based combat. The game received multiple year-end accolades, winning three <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> and IGN’s Game of the Year. With its success, it’s no wonder the team plans to celebrate its anniversary. However, it seems we may get some news there, as well.</p>







<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Celebrate Metaphor: ReFantazio’s birthday with us! 🥳</p><p>Join us October 10th for our 1-Year Anniversary Special, airing on the ATLUS West YouTube page.</p><p>📅 October 10, 9pm PT/12am ET/5am BST <a href="https://t.co/EjouxPLZl9">pic.twitter.com/EjouxPLZl9</a></p></div>— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atlus West</a>, an anniversary livestream for Metaphor: ReFantazio will happen on October 10th, 2025. The event will stream on YouTube and start at 9am PT/12pm EST. To find your timezone, check out this time checker <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/3a687b72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. As for what it will entail, it simply states that it wil be a celebration for the game’s one-year milestone. Luckily, the message does say that it will feature a “special message”. No other details were given regarding the tease.</p>



<p>It’s been rumored for a bit that Metaphor: ReFantazio may be ported to the Nintendo Switch, so it could be that. Coincidentally, Atlus’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlus-may-discuss-persona-3-reload-switch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 R</a>eload, which launched in 2023, is coming to the Switch this month. On the other hand, given the incredible reception to the title, we could see DLC or an enhanced version be announced. It’s a bit too soon for a sequel, but it may not be entirely out of the question. In any case, the game is available on Xbox Game Pass, so those interested can check it out there. For those who have already ventured to the United Kingdom of Euchronia, we may be returning rather soon.</p>



<p>Will you be tuning in for the Metaphor: ReFantazio livestream? What do you hope is announced there? Let us know in the comments below, in the forums, and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5f4cvU6G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/only-12-of-battlefield-6-players-give-a-damn-about-the-new-portal-mode.1319143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Battlefield 6 was revealed in full, Electronic Arts and the company’s associated studios spent a fair bit of time plugging the new Portal platform. It’s a full-fledged sandbox of sorts that allows players to create their own experiences, experimenting with Battlefield’s toolbox to manufacture all manner of fan-made functions.</p>



<p>In Battlefield 2042, Portal gave players a glimpse into the past, allowing them to play maps from previous games with all the weapons and vehicles that they fondly remember. In Battlefield 6, Portal is another thing entirely, but as it turns out, painfully few gamers actually give a damn about the mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-88-of-battlefield-players-don-t-care-about-portal">88% of Battlefield Players Don’t Care About Portal</h2>



<p>In an email circulated by Electronic Arts, a poll within revealed a range of four items that players had to vote on to determine which element of Battlefield 6 they’re most looking forward to.</p>



<p>By order of most popular to least popular, here are the results of that poll:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Destruction – 39%</li>



<li>Return of Campaign – 30%</li>



<li>Maps, Modes, and Weapons – 18%</li>



<li>Portal – 12%</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s surprising to see the Battlefield 6 campaign vote outpaces the maps, modes, and weapons vote by <strong>a mile</strong> – almost <strong>double</strong>. The Battlefield 6 campaign is a welcome addition to this release, and from the trailer released to showcase the story, it looks like it’s going to be a banger, but it always plays second fiddle to multiplayer.</p>



<p>The tactical destruction being at the top of the table comes as no surprise. That was one of the most talked-about elements of Battlefield 6 in and around the game’s beta, with clips from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> showcasing some jaw-dropping destruction that is being fine-tuned all the time.</p>



<p>Portal sitting flat at the bottom shows that players either don’t understand what it’s for this time around, or they simply don’t care. Why venture into Battlefield Portal in Battlefield 6 and play with the toolkit when you could 100% the campaign or grind multiplayer and rank up?</p>



<p>Portal will most likely become one of those things that is experimented with later, when players have gotten bored with the core offering. What’s bizarre is that DICE confirmed the Portal platform allows users to earn XP, no matter what they’re playing. That means that XP farms will be the only thing created on the platform in the early days</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Portal in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Ready to save the planet?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have published a brand new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 version of the 2020 PS4 original --which later got a PS5 upgrade <em>and</em> DLC.</p>
<p>Today's trailer acts as a bit of a rundown of the game's setting, Midgard, as well as the many factions within the sprawling metropolis. If you've already played the game on Sony's consoles or on PC, or even just played the original, you'll be <em>very</em> familiar with these names, but it's still worth a look.</p>
<p>Of course, Midgar is the setting for the entirety of the game — which is essentially the opening area in the OG PS1 release. The city acts as the base of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation that is monopolising the planet's energy and using it to power Midgar.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6294790c3c26"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6294790c3c26/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If planet-killing technologies weren't enough, then the company also has The Turks, a special task force who are left with "the company's dirty work", often involving assassinations, kidnapping, and other rather unsavoury things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a group opposing Shinra — Avalanche, a group you and Cloud will find yourself aligning with. They’re attempting to stop Shinra's abuse of power and save the planet by destroying Mako Reactors, which siphon the planet's energy.</p>

<p>And of course, to round the video off, we get a little snippet of info on both Cloud and Sephiroth — though it's safe to say <em>everyone</em> has heard of those. Right? <em>Riiiight?</em></p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, has been speaking <em>a lot</em> about the upcoming Switch 2 port lately. He's spoken about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-feel-a-great-responsibility-to-get-it-right-naoki-hamaguchi-on-the-pressure-of-remaking-final-fantasy-vii">feeling "a great responsibility"</a> to get the Remake right as well as how the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">team got the lighting just right</a> for this rerelease.</p>
<p>Plus, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">should be getting a demo</a> sometime before the game's 22nd <strong>January 2026</strong> release date, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games is suing two Michigan men, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, for allegedly abusing the <em>Fortnite</em> Island Creator program by artificially inflating engagement on their creations.</p><p>The company’s lawyers allege in a complaint filed Tuesday in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan that Nahdi and Nasser created and deployed “fake ‘bot’ player accounts to simulate real hum <em>Fortnite</em> engagement on their islands.” In doing so, lawyers write, the two men earned “tens of thousands of dollars in unwarranted payouts.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We are taking legal action against two UEFN developers who used bots to inflate their player counts,” an Epic Games spokesperson told Aftermath. “We also took down their islands and they are banned from <em>Fortnite</em>. Manipulating player engagement breaks our rules and will not be tolerated.”</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> user-generated content creators earn money from their creations with payouts related to engagement. People who create Islands in <em>Fortnite</em>—akin to Experiences in <em>Roblox</em>—earn money from a pool of money made up of 40% of revenue from Fortnite's Item Shop “and related real-money purchases.”&nbsp;</p><p>That pool of money is divided up and distributed based on two factors: <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-the-creator-economy-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player popularity and player retention</a>. The exact details of how the distribution is calculated isn’t public, but Epic Games’ lawyers say in the lawsuit that active players, active playtime, and returning players (“among other stats”) play into the calculation. Soon, <em>Fortnite</em> developers will be able to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell items from their <em>Fortnite</em> Islands</a> to earn additional revenue, but that hasn’t been rolled out yet. Currently, engagement is the only way to earn money from <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>“Before they got caught, Defendants were paid tens of thousands of dollars in unearned payments from Epic that would otherwise have been paid out to other developers who earned genuine engagement from real <em>Fortnite</em> players,” lawyers wrote in the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/929543657/Epic-Games-suing-two-Fortnite-Island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has been reviewed by Aftermath</a>. “Epic has also spent substantial resources investigating Defendants’ conduct and working to implement safeguards against unearned payments.”</p><p>Both Nahdi and Nasser entered the program months apart in December 2023 and March 2024, respectively, Epic Games’ lawyers say. They created multiple accounts with “inaccurate or incomplete personal information” to “create and publish a small number of <em>Fortnite </em>Islands.”&nbsp;</p><p>The multiple islands were a “scheme” to “disguise” the fake engagement, lawyers say. Between December 2024 and February 2025, Nahdi and Nasser created more than 20,000 fake bot accounts, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>“Defendants programmed the bot accounts to engage with Defendants’ own <em>Fortnite I</em>slands by using a cloud gaming service that allows users to play video games, like <em>Fortnite</em>, remotely,” lawyers say.</p><p>The fake bot accounts accounted for 90% of visitors to the islands Nahdi and Nasser created—and they only engaged with their Islands, lawyers say. Epic Games started to get suspicious after Nahdi and Nasser were paid out for December 2024, finding that nine out of 10 Islands created by the two were populated by 80% to 99% of engagement. Epic Games began immediately withholding portions of the engagement payments "attributable to the artificial engagement in January and February 2025.”&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games’ lawyers say that the fake account activity dropped after Epic Games withheld payment, “indicating the Defendants were aware their scheme had been detected.”</p><p>Epic Games is suing over breach of contract, copyright infringement, and fraud. It wants the court to forbid Nahdi and Nasser from accessing <em>Fortnite</em> or any server owned by Epic Games and award damages.&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games has been ramping up its efforts to punish people who cheat in <em>Fortnite </em>in the past few years; the company has pursued legal action against alleged cheaters recently. One <em>Fortnite</em> esports player who was caught cheating <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to publicly apologize</a> this year and had their prize money donated to charity. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-tournament-cheat-forced-to-pay-175k-banned-from-game-forever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Another player lost a $175,000 lawsuit</a> in June 2025 for cheating during <em>Fortnite</em> tournaments.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a short period since partnering with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/toho-animation-acquires-gkids-and-aims-to-bring-more-japanese-media-to-the-u-s-2000512287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toho</a>, GKids has established itself as the anime equivalent of the Criterion Collection. Through its theatrical rereleases of <a href="https://aftermath.site/linda-bae-doona-gkids-james-iha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep-cut cult-classic films from yesteryear</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime TV compilation preview films</a>, and getting in on the ground floor of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dandadan-first-encounter-review-gkids-crunchyroll-netflix-anime-2000499028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new hot shows</a>, GKids established a name for itself bringing fans from the hovels of their streaming home setups to that magical place where heartbreak feels good to Nicole Kidman: the theatre. Its forthcoming release, <a href="https://gkids.com/films/100-meters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>100 Meters</em></a> by Studio <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2663/Rockn_Roll_Mountain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock’N Roll Mountain,</a> taps into the big game pageantry by propelling one of the most low-key goated, yet slept-on, sports—track and field—into the limelight through the awesome artistic power of rotoscoped animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uoto</a>, a mangaka best known for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-orb-anime-review-madhouse-2000576670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Orb: On The Movements Of The Earth</em></a>, <em>100 Meters </em>follows two runners: Togashi, a gifted sprinter lauded by all for his natural-born talents, and Komiya, an unconventional runner working hard to make a name for himself on grit alone. Similar to Tatsuki Fujimoto’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a>, <em>100 Meters</em> follows the friendship-turned-rivalry of two friends from childhood through adolescence to adulthood as they struggle to meet their athletic goals without burning out or letting life’s challenges break them in their quest to become the absolute best in Japan’s 100-meter race.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="100 METERS | Official Trailer - In Theatres October 10" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXeYSCXSFhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I spoke with director <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=186313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenji Iwaisawa</a> about the ingenious decision to adapt Uoto’s manga using rotoscope animation, the challenges and triumphs of its implementation, and what he hopes the film will do not just for the sport but also for establishing his studio’s presence in the realm of animation on a global scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert: </strong><em>100 Meters</em> follows <em>Orb: On The Movements Of The Earth</em>, another critically acclaimed work from creator Uoto, which has pushed him into mainstream recognition. What attracted you to direct <em>100 Meters</em> as your latest project? How does it stand apart from other animated works you’ve helmed?</p><p><strong>Kenji Iwaisawa:</strong> I was really attracted to the world building that Uoto-sensei does in the original manga. Also, 100 meters is such a short race in a short amount of time. It’s very unusual to have that as the context of an animated movie, or anything. It’s really a first of its kind. It’s super unique, and I think that’s what really drew me into it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Rotoscoping has deep roots in animation history—often traced back to early horse motion studies. What made rotoscope animation feel like an intuitive choice for <em>100 Meters</em>, especially in capturing the kinetic intensity and emotional rhythm of running and character acting?</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>When I first started this project, I didn’t really know if rotoscoping would match it. But I think what worked out was not really when they’re racing, but, for example, the rain sequence—what happens before the race—or what happens after the race when they’re cooling down. I really thought rotoscoping matched those scenes better. I think that’s what works for the movie.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>What was the most technically challenging sequence to animate, and what made it so demanding, either emotionally or logistically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>What was really difficult about this movie is the dialogue-heavy scenes—when there’s two characters talking to each other—because there’s no bodily movement. And there’s a lot of scenes like that where they’re just talking to each other. I really had to think about how to depict that to make it more interesting for the audience.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Sound design in sports films is often overlooked despite being vital to their presentation. Was there any Foley work involved to capture the specific textures of runners’ footfalls, breathing, and track surfaces? How immersive did you want that sonic layer to be in <em>100 Meters</em>?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Because we use rotoscoping to take the film footage, the animation has realistic visuals. I really wanted to match the realistic visuals and have realistic sounds. This is a method that’s different from a normal animated movie. I got the live action film crew to take in the sound the way that they usually would like a sound team. I actually didn’t give them that much detailed instructions on how to take in the sound. I left it up to them, since they’re used to working on live action film.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did Uoto-sensei participate in the adaptation? What was his reaction upon viewing the film? Did he offer any suggestions, critiques, or goals in the lead-up to <em>100 Meters</em>’ theatrical release?</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Regarding the participation, he was really involved in the outline and script part of the film. Obviously, we couldn’t fit five volumes' worth of story into the film, so we wrote the script adapted for the film. We gave it to him, he gave us feedback, we would make adjustments, and then we’d give it back. That was repeated a couple of times, so he was pretty heavily involved in the script process.&nbsp;</p><p>As for his reaction, he really liked it. He thought it was really good. A big difference we made in the film is that we cut a lot of the monologues that the characters give when they’re running. Monologues, I think, are a specific characteristic of the manga, but he thought it was done really well, so that made me really happy.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Track and field is a fundamental sport, yet it’s often underrepresented in media. The film also highlights its true-to-life depiction of modest crowd sizes with seats filled with dedicated supporters. What impact do you hope <em>100 Meters</em> has on the perception of the sport, as well as Rock’N Roll Mountain’s place in the world of animation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Through watching <em>100 Meters</em>, if people could get interested in track and field, even if they don’t specifically get into it, if they watch this film, [and ] it adds some joy, spark, or positive impact to their daily lives, that’d be great. Rock’N Roll Mountain, my studio, was created to support my career as a director. I think my style is unique, and I also think my works are unique too. (Laughs) So if I could continue creating works through my studio, it would be nice if everyone worldwide would know the name of my studio, hopefully.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>100 Meters</em> hits select theaters on October 10 and will be available nationwide from October 12 to October 14.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The next mainline <i>Resident Evil</i> game is months away, and the hype among devoted fans is likely as contagious as a well-designed Umbrella Corp. bio-weapon. <i>Requiem</i> doesn’t just look the part of a dark and violent survival horror game; the developers have made it clear that <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><i>Requiem </i>really wants to scare you,</a> unlike some previous <i>RE</i> titles that were more action-oriented. And with its return to the iconic series’ location of Raccoon City, <i>Requiem </i>is sure to make <i>RE</i> lore enthusiasts eager to sink their teeth into every new detail it reveals in the series’ larger canon.</p> <p><i>Resident Evil</i> has been with us since 1996. Since then, it’s become one of the most iconic and celebrated survival horror series out there, and deservedly so with its iconic cast of heroes and villains. Though some entries haven’t landed as well with hardcore fans, the series has arguably been riding high since 2017’s <i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i>. And it didn’t stop there; a series of successful remakes of games from the series’ glory years in the ‘90s and 2000s have also served as reminders that when <i>Resident Evil</i> is firing on all cylinders, it’s a force to be reckoned with.</p>

 <p><i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, also known as <i>Resident Evil 9</i>, launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-release-date-re7-2000625335">Switch 2</a>, and Windows PCs on February 27, 2026. Officially announced and shown off <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">during Summer Game Fest</a>, the game will follow the story of Grace Ashcroft as she revisits the nightmares of her past in her official duties as a technical analyst for the FBI.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">A Bunch Of <i>Resident Evil</i> Games Are Reportedly Getting Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">Grace’s past isn’t something she’s keen to relive</a>. Unlike many other <i>RE</i> protagonists, she’s hardly battle-hardened. But she’s certainly had her own experiences with the series’ legendary violent threats, so she’s not a total newbie. Still,<i> Requiem</i> is ambitious for its use of a new protagonist and a return to an iconic city. So, what can we expect when the game arrives in 2026? Let’s go over everything we’ve learned about this highly anticipated sequel.</p>

 <h2><i>Requiem</i> will embrace both first- and third-person</h2> <p><i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i> was the first mainline <i>RE</i> game to pivot exclusively to a first-person perspective (though the series had had its share of first-person action in earlier spin-offs). Its follow-up, <i>Village</i>, started off in first-person but eventually introduced a third-person option. <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Requiem</i> will allow you to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at launch</a>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Resident Evil 9</i> Lets You Swap Between First-Person And Third-Person Whenever You Want</a></p> <p><i>Biohazard</i> made a compelling case for <i>RE</i> in first-person (even if it did feel like an answer to <a href="https://kotaku.com/od-hideo-kojima-productions-silent-hill-pt-game-awards-1851089141">Hideo Kojima’s wildly popular <i>Silent Hills</i> demo</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-actually-knows-how-they-solved-the-silent-hill-t-1621044581">had everyone terrified at the time</a>), so it feels appropriate for the series to carry on with it. But after three remakes (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i>), it’s clear that surviving <i>RE</i>’s environments in third-person is also a treat. How then, could we possibly choose between them?</p>

 <p>The gameplay sounds promising. Thanks to a playable demo available during Gamescom earlier this year, some folks got a taste of the action. It seems clear that first-person amplifies the fear, but third-person will still be a spooky good time.</p>

  <p>The demo featured a flashback scene in which Grace is without a gun to wield and the experience to wield it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><i>IGN</i>’s Matt Kim</a> described a chase sequence in which Grace has nothing but empty bottles to throw at one of <i>RE</i>’s most terrifying creatures yet.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i>Kotaku</i>’s Kenneth Shepard described his time</a> with the demo as featuring more “hide-and-seek horror” than the likes of the series’ eighth entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>. “It felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness.”</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> is about ‘addictive fear’</h2> <p>In a special <a href="https://youtu.be/-hiC3qpghP0">‘Creators’ Message’ video from Capcom last June</a>, <i>Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi described the philosophy behind <i>Requiem</i>, and it’s all about establishing an emotional contour that fans of survival horror know very well:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our core concept for this game was “addictive fear.” There’s something about the catharsis you get from overcoming your fears. It creates an addiction that makes you want to do more, to play more. That intense focus, while scary, makes for a really fun game. This served as our launching point for <i>Requiem</i>.</p></blockquote> <p>While <i>RE</i> has largely course-corrected itself back toward horror starting with <i>Biohazard</i> in 2017, this is still music to the ears of us survival horror fans. Of <i>RE</i>’s large cast of characters, many are exceedingly proficient with firearms and, by now, are well acquainted with surviving hordes of zombies and lumbering giants eager to stalk them. Grace, then, with her comparative lack of experience, enters as a way to allow players’ fears to synergize with the character’s emotional state.</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> wants to avoid just letting you shoot your way through zombies</h2> <p>Originally, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-decision-to-scrap-leon-kennedy-as-a-playable-character-shows-the-franchise-is-finally-stepping-away-from-hardened-and-stoic-protagonists/">Capcom thought to center series legend Leon Kennedy</a>, the main character of <i>RE4</i> and co-protagonist of <i>RE2</i> and <i>6</i>, in <i>Requiem</i>. But given how experienced (and likely PTSD-ridden) Kennedy is, it didn’t seem to be a good fit. In the “Creator’s Message” video from last summer, Nakanishi said of Leon Kennedy:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Making a horror game based around [Leon] is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s how we got our new girl, Grace, as our protagonist for <i>Requiem</i>. But though we have a fresh face ready to scream in terror, <i>Requiem</i> is hoping to avoid just building up to a shooting spree with every baddie. “Of course, there will be boss battles,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-boss-battles-will-be-more-like-the-originals-and-re2s-but-will-still-include-several-new-combat-options/">Nakashi told <i>Automaton</i></a> in a joint interview at Tokyo Game Show this year. He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>However, rather than defeating enemies in a flashy manner as you progress through the game, like in games that emphasize gun-shooting action, the style is more like <i>Resident Evil </i>and <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, where players expand their exploration area in a closed space and overcome obstacles using their wits.</p></blockquote> <h2><i>Requiem</i> sounds like a perfect excuse to go back and play every <i>Resident Evil</i> game</h2> <p><i>Requiem</i> will arrive just before <i>Resident Evil</i> celebrates its 30th birthday. Director Nakanishi has stated that the title itself is intended “to mark a milestone in the series” with its return to Raccoon City, where everything in the game’s fictional universe started. The team sees the game as a “requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>  <p>So if there was ever a <i>Resident Evil</i> game to make you go back and play through the series to prepare, it sounds like <i>Requiem</i>, arriving just before the series’ third decade, is the game to do that with.</p>

 <h2>Hey, what about those rumors you’re seeing on the internet?</h2> <p>If you have a working internet connection and the ability to type <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i> into a search bar, you’ve likely seen alleged leaks and speculation about the game. Video games are fertile ground for wild theories and some folks have gone a little overboard with such things.&nbsp; <i>Requiem</i>’s producer, Masata Kumazawa, is well aware of this.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/">In an interview with <i>The Gamer</i></a>, Kumazawa said the following:</p> <blockquote><p>I would like everyone to remember, let’s calm down a bit–what we’ve shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumors and theories were such that they were widely believed.</p></blockquote> <p>So yeah, the game ain’t that far away. Let’s relax with the speculation.</p> <hr> <p>Speaking for myself, I don’t think I’ve been this excited about a <i>Resident Evil</i> game since <i>RE4</i>. Hopefully the game lives up to that excitement when it arrives in February of 2026. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a few missing entries in the <i>Resident Evil</i> catalog to catch up on.</p>

If they do, the price will go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge confirmed with Microsoft</a> that the price increase only affects users in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India if they cancel and then sign up again.</p><p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," Microsoft said in an email to subscribers in those regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAEKqYgIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9wAEKqYgIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Verge members in the regions mentioned above can continue renewing at their existing price, but only "for now." This is due to "local requirements," Microsoft said. The email sent to members said they will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of a price change. Given that, people in those regions shouldn't expect to pay the higher rates for at least a couple months.</p><p>In the US, existing subscriber should expect to begin paying the higher rates on November 4, Microsoft told The Verge. New subscribers in the US, however, must pay $30/month for Ultimate right now.</p><p>Also worth noting is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">numerous retailers in the US continue to sell Game Pass Ultimate for $20</a>, so people who want to keep their membership and pay less should grab those while they still can.</p><p>Microsoft is jacking up Game Pass Ultimate prices just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release on November 14. As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">playing Call of Duty on Game Pass just got a lot more expensive. </a></p>

		<p>Jaw Drop Games has released its co-op dinosaur survival horror Deathground into Early Access on Steam, with a 15% launch discount. Its regular price will be $14.99 / €14.79 / £11.99. The development team has also released a roadmap of what player should expect for the future of Deathground, including additional content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deathground | Dinosaur Survival Horror Game | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-WcSU8wAHhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Deathground has launched with six operatives to choose from including Scout, Medic, Observer, Engineer, Survivalist, and Hunter. There are two AI enemy types with those being the Utahraptor and Compsognathus, two training grounds and three missions across three maps. Those missions are Restart the Power Plant on the Geothermal map, Spray The Greenhouse in the Agricultural map, and Secure The Specimen in the Biomedical map. Players also have access to four tools with those being the motion detector, hacking device, tranquilizer gun, and and a med kit. Following on from today, there will be monthly mini updates which will add two story events, three sub missions, three items, and bug fixes. In the future, the Allosaurus will be added along with two more maps with associated missions, more story events, proximity chat, and two more loadout items. Even further down the line, more enemies will be added with even more story events, maps, missions, items, and collectables.</p>
<p>In Deathground, teams of up to four players have to work together to complete the missions while trying to survive the threat of dinosaurs that are hunting them. Deathground was first announced back in 2020, so it has been a long journey for the game to stomp on to Steam.</p>

<p>More reveals coming next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with a friend in local co-op, then you know how chaotic things can get. Heck, if you've played enough of it on your own and come up with a ridiculous screen-filling build, then you've seen how far you can push the limits.</p>
<p>Well, poncle is <em>finally</em> adding online co-op to the "bullet heaven" game in version 1.14, which is coming this Autumn. Up to four players will be able to join a room and fight their way through various Vampire Survivors stages.</p>
<p>But it's only the first in a line of updates that the developer will be revealing over the course of the next month — with the next reveal coming "next week". Four more updates are coming, so we're waiting with bated (garlic) breath.</p>
<p>For now, here's a rundown of online co-op:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online Co-Op is coming to Vampire Survivors this Autumn on PC and consoles!</p>
<p>Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended. (That’s 4 players in total!)</p>
<p>Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665… More players doesn’t make it easier, or does it?</p>
<p>Autumn is our time to shine, so be sure to come back next week to see what the following card will reveal… we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game's last free update added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-owners-might-want-to-check-out-this-handy-update-for-vampire-survivors">cross-save to the Switch version back in June 2025</a>. And in April, Square Enix teamed up with Square Enix to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/vampire-survivors-and-square-enix-team-up-for-free-dlc-but-its-not-the-series-youd-expect">SaGa-themed DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Will we get a good ol' Switch 2 Edition? Mouse controls? Time will tell!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the availability of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/arc-raiders-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle</a>. Purchasing a qualifying NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 desktop or GPU, or laptop with a GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, or RTX 5070 Laptop GPU at select retailers and digital stores will provide access to the upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter.</p>



<p>More specifically, users will receive a digital code to unlock ARC Raiders Deluxe Edition plus Astro Cosmetic Pack, which comes with the following goodies:</p>



<p><strong><em>The Wanderer Cosmetic Pack</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>“Valente” Legendary Outfit</em></li>

He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s easy to run out of storage on your Xbox Series S or X when a single game can eat up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549814/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-cold-war-file-size-ps5-xbox-series-x">over 100GB</a>. The best (and pretty much <em>only</em>) solution is to buy an expansion card from Seagate or Western Digital. You can store Xbox games on a USB external hard drive, yes, but you’ll need to re-transfer them to the system’s internal storage to play them. An expansion card allows you to play games from your library without having to move anything around.</p><p>Fortunately, you can pick up a <strong>512GB WD Black C50 expansion card</strong> for $85.99 ($8 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its second-lowest price since May. <strong>Western Digital’s 1TB expansion card</strong> is on sale for around $119.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fwd-c50-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-gaming-console-ssd-black%2FJXJ62C6RX8" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price since July, though it’s $20 shy of beating that price.</p><p><strong>Seagate’s storage expansion card</strong>, meanwhile, starts in a 1TB configuration, and is discounted to around $123.49 ($30.50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5HZ2W7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is lower than it was last Prime Day. If you need even more space, a 2TB card is on sale for $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-2tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5H459S" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which also bests its previous Prime Day price.

            <title><![CDATA[Some Xbox Fans Can Skip The Game Pass Price Hike For Now]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-xbox-fans-can-skip-the-game-pass-price-hike-for-now.1319050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current Game Pass Ultimate subscribers <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">are getting hit with the new 50-percent price hike</a> on November 4, but only in some countries. Microsoft recently confirmed that fans in places like Poland and Korea can remain at the lower monthly price if they stay subscribed. Not so for Xbox users in the U.S.</p> <p>The confusion started when some fans started sharing the emails they’d received from Microsoft about Game Pass Ultimate going from $20 a month to $30. While some of those messages informed players about a price hike they’d see next time they renewed their subscription, others were told the pricing wouldn’t change unless they ended their subscriptions and later resumed them. Microsoft has now confirmed that the delay is only for users in some markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India. Players in the U.S. and UK will see the changes take affect as planned on November 4.</p>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is that one real. I got one saying tough it’s going up. <a href="https://t.co/EHbqiWvCr8">pic.twitter.com/EHbqiWvCr8</a></p> <p>— I play games (@G_Obertron) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Obertron/status/1975558838607839518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <div> <p>“Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a new statement.</p> <p>Why the discrepancy? Some have been speculating it has to do with local laws restricting how companies can hike subscription prices and the amount of heads-up they have to give consumers. Either way, it’s a bummer for any Xbox fan in the U.S. who thought they might be getting an unexpected reprieve from the latest Xbox price hikes. Microsoft also recently confirmed that Game Pass subscribers are <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">no longer eligible for 10 percent off of DLC</a> and other add-on content. That perk’s been replaced by an overhauled rewards program.</p> </div>
