		<p>2K and Gearbox have released a new story trailer for Borderlands 4, which shows us some elements of the setting of the next entry to the series. In this trailer, we see some of how The Timekeeper, the main antagonist of Borderlands 4, rules the planet of Kairos. The Timekeeper does this from a tower in Dominion City, with his Commander’s executing his will (and enemies) across the rest of Kairos. This follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/check-out-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-reveal-everything-we-now-know/">the Borderlands 4 gameplay reveal</a> that took place at the end of April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Story Trailer | Borderlands 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Vault Hunter you are not just looking for treasures across Kairos. You have a run in with The Timekeeper and as a result events are set into motion where you, and other Vault Hunters, are on a mission to end The Timekeeper’s iron fisted regime and bring freedom to Kairos. There will be characters across Kairos that will be sympathetic to your cause too and will be allies in the fight that will determine the future of the planet. You can play Borderlands 4 alone or team up with others in four player co-op, exploring the planet, fighting bandits and bosses, and discovering lots of different weapons. Looting has been revamped for Borderlands 4 with Legendaries being much rarer, with decent weapons easier to find. Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is now available to pre-order with the standard version priced at £69.99. There is a digital deluxe edition available for £89.99 which includes Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin, Gilded Glory Pack, and Bounty Pack Bundle. The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at £119.99, includes the items from the deluxe edition along with the Ornate Order Pack and the Vault Hunter Pack. Those who pre-order the game will get the Gilded Glory pack and that includes a Vault Hunter skin, a weapon skin, and an Echo-4 drone skin.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 will release on September 12th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3e3334b44c74/donkey-konga-2-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mmm, bananas. <em>Ahem</em>, sorry about that. We meant to say, welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we swing over to this week's bongo brawlers, let's quickly recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-jet-set-radio-dreamcast">last time</a> when three covers from the Dreamcast's <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> went head to head (to head). There was a decent spread of votes, but the funky Japanese design ultimately walked away with 46% of the split and the win. North America followed behind with 30%, and Europe took home the remaining slice — <em>funky</em>.</p>
<p>After the week we've had in Nintendo Land, there was only one direction we could head in this time. With DK on the brain, we're turning to the prized primate's beloved bongo-bashing sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> ('Hit Song Parade', in Japan), for another three-way vote.</p><p><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0trnihg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You don't need us to provide a recap of this one. The series still slaps, it's been too long, trilogy remaster when? etc. Keep to the beat as we meet our three competitors below.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:159632,184111 @ 1750590372 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c0914233e26c/donkey-konga-2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Woah, DK! You're hitting the bongo so hard, your legs have swung into the air! That's too much bongo, DK!</p>
<p>The central pose is fitting, really, when you consider just how hard this cover slaps. The red and white background, the cel-shaded DK, that rock-and-roll spray-painted '2' in the logo. Just makes you want to whip out the peripherals and go for a bongo sesh, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b44c041163d/donkey-konga-2-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design is a little tamer, by comparison, but it does have added Diddy Kong, which is always a bonus. The bright green background subtly packs in some musical notes (a nice touch), and we're fans of the DK and Diddy sprites that appear in the logo — did we really need the other ones down the bottom, though?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78f5519329731/donkey-konga-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, now that's more like it! The logo from the European design returns here, but it takes centre stage on its own. With the focus on DK and Diddy, and the bonus balloons and confetti that are scattered around them, this one really sells the 'party' vibes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-donkey-konga-2]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-%E2%80%98witchery%E2%80%99-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed.1225080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-new-trailer-45-minute-livestream-set-for-june-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment have released a lengthy gameplay overview for the action RPG The Blood of Dawnwalker in which the studio's CD Projekt roots were very clear. Gamers were shown combat both as a human and as a vampire, as well as the different approaches to quests depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The footage was captured on PC from the game's latest pre-beta build without any additional post-capture cleanup. It already looks very good, though. After fighting some bandits, protagonist Coen enters the region’s largest city, Svartrau, showing a bustling town fairly reminiscent of Novigrad from The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>One of the key features of The Blood of Dawnwalker is the stark contrast between day and night: bustling medieval life masks the influence of a vampire regime during the day, while moonlit rooftops reveal hidden secrets at night. Moreover, as a Dawnwalker, Coen is neither fully human nor entirely vampire. During the day, he can wield a sword and use magical runes in the form of bloody scars etched onto his skin, although this kind of magic comes at a cost: it siphons off a portion of Coen's health.</p>
<p>During the night, Coen embraces his supernatural instincts and unlocks an entirely new set of powers. His nocturnal abilities include lethal vampiric claws and Shadowstep, a skill that allows him to navigate across rooftops swiftly. At nighttime, Coen must also constantly grapple with his relentless bloodlust. During gameplay, visual cues help players to assist Coen in satisfying his hunger in various ways, such as drinking the blood of foes (including vampires, innocent villagers, and animals) or using special blood vials.</p>
<p>If he remains unsatisfied, not only will this craving weaken his abilities and vitality, but it may also cause him to lose control in critical moments and unintentionally kill an important character in the story. This wouldn't be the end of the game, though; one of the core tenets laid out by Rebel Wolves is that of the narrative sandbox, where there is no difference between main and side quests, and each consequence of the player's actions will simply push the story forward, albeit in a different direction.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XOa0JYJv8g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Polish developers also revealed that The Blood of the Dawnwalker uses a For Honor-like directional combat system (albeit with four directions) designed to bring cinematic intensity and tactical challenge to every confrontation. Players must study enemy movements, block precisely, and time their counterattacks well to perform seamless, strategic takedowns.</p>
<p>The overview ends with Coen's confrontation with one of the vampire bosses, Xanthe, which ends badly for the player character. Rebel Wolves noted that players can take on the bosses, even the final one, relatively early on if they so choose, but they will be extremely challenging. The game runs on a sort of timer because Coen has only 30 days to save his family, although the developers said it's more like a resource than an actual countdown.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco confirmed that The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>The "gnarly remake" adds multiple new parks</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> revives two more classics next month, but that's not all! In case you missed it, it's also adding a new pinball-themed park to the series featuring the Birdman himself.</p>
<p>This is one of multiple new parks "joining the lineup of original parks" in this upcoming title, due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>11th July 2025</strong>. To build up the excitement, Activision and Iron Galaxy have now released a new trailer showcasing this park in motion. Here's what you can expect along with some of the inspiration behind this design:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pinball drops players into a pinball game featuring the tombstones of fallen skaters around a playfield filled with ramps, rails, and flippers at the control of Tony Hawk. Watch out for silver balls running down the board and track your best combo on the backbox display.</p>
<p>"Developer Iron Galaxy Studios shares a special connection to pinball, many of its early members incorporating their knowledge acquired while working for Midway Games in Chicago, a prominent name in arcade and pinball gaming. This homage offers the perfect mix honoring their roots while flexing their creative skills in a wild new park design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can expect all sorts of wild segments throughout this park including "the eyeball", "brains", and even a river filled with "hungry alligators". Apart from this pinball park, some other new parks include Movie Studio and Waterpark.</p>
<p>Here are some additional screenshots and you can even get some "pro tips" about what to be on the lookout for in this park over on the official <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-park-map-guide-pinball">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 blog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've said it a ton over the last few weeks, but interest in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a> is at what feels like an all-time high. With the recently released Final Fantasy Universes Beyond crossover set, new players that may have never picked up a card are now inching ever so slowly towards one of the most addicting and time-consuming hobbies around. If you're one of these people, or someone looking to dip your toes into the wonderful world of hundred-dollar cardboard, IGN has you covered with our Magic: The Gathering beginner's guide.</p><p id="where-to-play"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to play">Where to Start Playing in Person</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For newcomers, the best place to start playing in person is with what we call "kitchen table" Magic. No formats, no banlist, no meta, just good old fashioned vibes. Find a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">starter kit</a> you like, grab a friend, sleeve them up, and jump in. These starter decks are great ways to learn the rules. I'd also highly recommend picking up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-foundations-preorders-are-live-right-now-on-amazon">MTG Foundations</a>, as this set is specifically designed with brand new players in mind. </p><div catalogid="1ef3abe4-e9f2-4d29-a4d2-35077c9aeb4b" id="223131"><div id="223131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Find in-person events and stores to play Friday Night Magic</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards Event Locator</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that you've learned the rules, found the colors you like, and learned a strategy that suits you, you probably want to move up to playing at a local game store (LGS) in your area. Your mileage will vary, as some stores' player bases favor certain formats over others. But for the most part, many LGSs will run the Standard format as their primary Friday Night Magic (FNM) event. To find an LGS near you, use the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards Event Locator</a> to enter your address and distance you want to check.</p></div><p id="formats"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Formats">MTG Formats</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every store is different, and not everybody enjoys playing the same formats all the time. Here's a quick breakdown of some of the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular formats</a>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Standard:</strong> This is the most entry-level 60-card, best-of-three format in Magic. You can use cards from the last two years, and cards will rotate out every Fall.</li><li><strong>Limited:</strong> Limited formats are 40-card events where you don't show up with your own preconstructed decks. The two options are <strong>Booster Draft</strong>, where pods of eight players will open booster packs and pick a card one by one, passing their pack to the next player until three packs have been drafted. <strong>Sealed</strong> is where you get six booster packs, open them, and build your deck from this pool. </li><li><strong>Pioneer: </strong>Pioneer is the next step up in terms of power level from Standard. This format is non-rotating, and only cards from Return to Ravnica to current sets are legal. No supplementary sets are allowed, like Commander decks or sets like Modern Horizons.</li><li><strong>Modern: </strong>Easily the most popular format among competitive players, Modern allows you to use cards from Mirrodin onward, save for Commander deck cards. Direct-to-Modern sets like Modern Horizons are legal, and are big contributors to the format's current meta.</li><li><strong>Legacy: </strong>Every Magic set is legal in Legacy, including Commander decks. This means it has some of the most powerful decks in the game, the most expensive, and is the most difficult to learn. If you're starting out, you likely will not touch Legacy any time soon, if ever. </li><li><strong>Pauper: </strong>One of my personal favorite formats, Pauper is essentially Legacy Lite. Every set is fair game, but you can only use common rarity cards. Many of Legacy's strongest cards are common, like Brainstorm and Ponder, so Pauper is a great format to learn when you're curious about these interactions. </li><li><strong>Commander:</strong> Commander is the format most new and casual players are familiar with. Commander is a format where up to four players battle it out with 100-card decks, where each deck is built around their Commander (a Legendary creature of their choice). You can only build your deck using your Commander's colors. </li></ul><p id="where-to-buy-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy cards">TCGPlayer Is a Great Place to Buy Cards</h2></p><div catalogid="1ef3abe4-e9f2-4d29-a4d2-35077c9aeb4b" id="223134"><div id="223134" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>TCGPlayer is one of the biggest online TCG storefronts</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All Constructed formats have a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of banned cards</a> to help balance out the meta and remove insane combos from their respective formats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the best place to pick up singles to round out your decks or find sealed product, I recommend <a href="https://www.cardkingdom.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Card Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a>.

            <p>
A little over three years since it was announced, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreamsettler">Dreamsettler</a>, the spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, has been cancelled. Yesterday, lead developer Jay Tholen shared a video simply titled "Dreamsettler is canceled", where he explained some of his reasoning behind the decision. "This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of the video.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
After noting that he "didn't want to make a video like this," the developer went on to explain that Dreamsettler is cancelled, going on to say that this means "it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."

<p>
He also noted how it was bad timing given that a Patreon to help keep the project going was only launched earlier this year. There are also plans to try to release the part of the game that do exist, including the soundtrack from returning composer The Chowder Man, in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
In a short version of events, Tholan explained that with Dreamsettler, they had a budget this time, so "we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time." In turn, there was a specific schedule to follow, and Tholen noted he has "never successfully made a game based on a design document."
</p>
<p>
He later said that he thinks he's a "hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."
</p>
<p>
In the years since announcing Dreamsettlers, Tholen did also work on Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, a boomer shooter spin-off made by the in-world Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane - former RPS staffer Liam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slayers-x-terminal-aftermath-vengance-of-the-slayer-review-a-boisterous-hypnospace-spin-off-thats-an-obnoxious-gem">reviewed it</a> and had some positive but mixed feelings on it. Co-founder John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypnospace-outlaw-review">reviewed</a> Hypnospace Outlaw back in the day too, coming away from it quite enamoured.

            <p>
Ever since Gravity Rush 2 came out eight years ago (let's not focus too hard on how much time that actually is for my mental health), I have, unfortunately, not been able to stop thinking about it. It is a game with a world full of whimsy, video game ass mechanics, and, most interestingly of all, a plot that quite directly deals with topics like class. What more can you want! And yet a sequel has never materialised. Lucky for me, just yesterday a new gravity shifting game entered the scene: Metro Gravity.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Metro Gravity isn't just a clone of Gravity Rush. Where the PlayStation game lets you control gravity at will, Metro Gravity lets you walk on almost any surface, with the option to lock in the gravity of wherever you're standing. There are abilities that let you shift gravity in particular directions, but what is essentially the power of flight isn't available to you in Metro Gravity (at least, in as much of the game as I have played).

<p>
There are more twists beyond that too. Its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> combat is rhythm-game adjacent in that enemies will attack you to the beat of whatever track is playing at any given moment (these vary from place to place, more on that in a second). A short while into the game you'll pick up the ability to parry a la Sekiro, and with that in hand the combat becomes an artful balance of dodging, blocking, and attacking at just the right moments. It's oh so delicious, if it's your kind of thing anyway.
</p>
<p>
The final spin, and perhaps the biggest, is that it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Most metroidvanias typically take the route of the second dimension rather than the third, and with the fact that Metro Gravity lets you walk on any wall, you might rightly have a fear that it becomes confusing to navigate. I haven't found that yet myself, as while it took me a moment to adjust in terms of my spatial reasoning, when you find a map of a particular area - these range in aesthetics and vibes, and consequently music, and thusly an array of music to time your attacks to - it becomes fairly simple to figure out where to go.
</p>
<p>
I quite like what I've played of Metro Gravity, I often think about how there aren't enough 3D metroidvanias in the world, and I feel quite excited to jump back into this one! The game just launched on Steam yesterday, and you can check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">here</a>.

                <p>Gearbox has revealed a new story trailer for its looter-shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>. While it was brief, it did reveal a fresh look at the game's primary villain, the Timekeeper, his minions, and franchise punching bag Claptrap.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onY6y4NZ-t4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date--and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game is priced at $70</a>. With its launch date drawing closer, Gearbox has been revealing more details on the game, and how it's building on the Borderlands foundation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">with a seamless world to explore</a>, dynamic events to take part in, and an overhauled drop-rate for weapons that will make legendary-class feel special again.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-reacts-to-criticisms-over-borderlands-3s-humor/1100-6532530/">Another big change in Borderlands 4 is its tone</a>, as Gearbox wants the humor in the game to be more grounded. Essentially, this sounds like Borderlands 4 won't be relying on comedy that can become very quickly dated after launch.</p><p>"This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p>

Bloody conflicts sweep the lands, and the Black Death comes for the survivors. It’s a moment of weakness – and that’s all they needed. Vampires seize their opportunity to walk out of the shadows and claim what they’ve been denied for centuries: freedom, and the power that comes with it. Other creatures of the night follow their lead. Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same.</p><p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family. Whatever your choice, the question stands: is your soul worth the lives of those you love?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

Embark on the quest to save your family, or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way. Discover ancient secrets lurking in the valley.

You will not have time for everyone. The world waits for no one.

            <p>
I know this is a PC games focused outlet, but I'd like to present to you the most PS3 coded game I've seen in a long while: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chains-of-lukomoyre">Chains of Lukomoyre</a>. Now, to be clear I mean this in the most loving of ways possible. That era of video games obviously set the foundations for the rinse and repeat we see in a lot of triple-A games these days, but there was still the occasional oddity out there that just had the right vibe. And I think Chains of Lukomoyre fits that vibe quite well.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In terms of plot, the game features a Slavic folklore inspired setting in an alternate post-WW1 world where "Allied experiments shattered reality itself." I'm no fan of war, but I certainly am a fan of reality shattering experiments. You play as a soldier on a quest to find a lost love, meeting all sorts of weird creatures along the way in a story that's described as a "reimagining of Orpheus and Eurydice through the lens of war, memory, and myth." There's a giant black cat, a hut with chicken legs, a creepy nesting doll, lots of good stuff.

<p>
It's a third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> too, and while the announcement trailer does show off some gameplay, it doesn't show a huge amount of what you're doing. The thing that really makes me say "oh, it's a PS3 game" is the presence of quick-time events, a staple of the console honestly. This isn't particularly exciting because nobody really likes quick-time events, it's really the mixture of Slavic folklore and wartime aesthetics that's luring me in. I've had enough of western fairytales, it's about time other cultures get their time to shine.
</p>
<p>
In any case, as of now Chains of Lukomoyre doesn't have a release date in sight, but you can at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3746310/Chains_of_Lukomorye/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>While Japanese video game consultancy firm Kyos Inc insists that publishers are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">"thanking Nintendo"</a> for the move following rising production costs of physical media, others are less keen on them; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">almost 70% of you said you wouldn't be buying Game-Key Card releases</a>, and many companies within the industry have said they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nightdive-studios-ceo-says-that-game-key-cards-on-switch-2-is-disheartening">dislike the approach.</a></p>
<p>Game-Key Cards are Nintendo's attempt to bridge the gap between 'code in a box' releases and traditional game cards, where the game data is included on the card itself. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">Many have warned that this system is anti-consumer</a>; when Nintendo turns off the servers in a few years, the cards become useless.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">who has already spoken to us about the subject</a>, has taken to social media to issue a rallying call to developers—people don't want Game-Key Card releases, so, if your studio is looking to produce a physical Switch 2 release, they should get in touch with the boutique publisher:</p>

<p>While Game-Key Cards have been rejected by many consumers, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">recent leak</a> gives a pretty solid reason why so many companies are embracing them; if you want to publish your game physically on Switch 2, you have to pay Nintendo for 64GB card—there are no smaller options this time around, unfortunately, as was the case with Switch 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo itself has said it will not be using Game-Key Cards for any of its first-party games.</a></p>

            <p>
Unfortunately, it's that time of the month again. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developer 1047 Games shared a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341958451004088321/">post on LinkedIn</a> announcing that layoffs had taken place at the company. It was described as a "small group of valued 1047 Games team members," but as is par for the course for games industry layoffs, there was no mention of how many have been laid off - though of course the usual spiel about "redirecting resources" to make the game better. You know, classic corporation speak.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Notably, co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have apparently "opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project." This is normally where I'd say something like "credit where credit is due", because Proulx's father Tom Proulx is literally the co-founder of Intuit, a huge American software company, so I don't imagine him to be particularly hard done by with this decision. And, you know, this is the same guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wore that ridiculous hat at Summer Game Fest</a>, so you'll be hearing no compliments from me.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear as to whether this means Splitgate 2 is underperforming at all at the moment. The hat thing wasn't the only controversy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> faced, as the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">launched with some pretty ridiculous prices for some of its in-game items</a>. A one-two punch of a bad PR move and extortionate prices does not a healthy community make. In any case, as always I hope everyone that's been affected by the layoffs is able to land on their feet.

Steam user reviews remain on ‘mixed.’</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not paint the whole picture, of course, given Splitgate 2 launched across consoles as well as PC. Indeed, 1047 Games has said Splitgate 2 has had over 2.5 million players. But clearly, things have not gone as well as the studio had hoped. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">an interview with IGN shortly after launch</a>, Proulx said he was “surprised” by the reaction, admitting “we didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, 1047 Games has suffered a round of layoffs, which it characterized as “a small group” of staff in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/1047games_today-we-parted-ways-with-a-small-group-of-activity-7341958451004088321-0q4q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>. Also in the post came confirmation that co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries, as the studio aims to improve the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We’re still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players. We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project.

<p>The accompanying 18-second teaser doesn't give much away, sadly, but Sega's transmedia boss Justin Scarpone told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-unveils-plans-for-tokyo-flagship-store-alongside-nintendo/">VGC</a> last year that it was time to put the Sega brand - and not just Sonic - "in front of consumers".</p>

<p>"Our portfolio is very broad, but the common thread is the Sega brand," Scaprone said at the time. "Sega already has a surprising amount of fandom as a brand, and we need to look after those fans and offer new experiences to them, while putting the stamp of Sega on it more proudly.</p>
<p>"It's really exciting, and we need to do a lot more of that, because Sega is a consumer brand that is surprisingly not in front of consumers enough. Sonic is, but Sega isn't."</p>
<p>A second store is also expected to open in Shanghai, but as yet there's no news of an expansion into Europe or America.</p>
<p>Alex recently caught up with Takashi Iizuka, the Sonic series producer who first worked on the franchise just two years into his career and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">stuck with the blue blur for all these years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sega-store-tokyo-is-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> actor said he "possibly misled some people" when he teased a Red Dead Redemption-related announcement was on the way.</p>
<p>Last week, John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-teases-he-cannot-wait-for-us-to-know-about-a-big-announcement-thats-coming-before-friday">very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement</a>, stressing that he was particularly excited as he livestreamed "this game", the original Red Dead Redemption. His tease came just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, and Roger Clark - who portrays Red Dead 2's Arthur Morgan - <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">backed up Wiethoff's tease</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, Wiethoff has walked back his comments, reminding fans that he "do[es] not make announcements for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>", yet still insists he has something exciting to tell us.</p>

<figcaption>Gym Buddy with Rob Wiethoff.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhI02Ma_Kno" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"There's one more thing I wanna say," Wiethoff told his viewers on YouTube as he introduced a livestreamed gym buddy session on YouTube. "I don't know how to say this exactly, I'll just say the one thing, uh, that I need to say, and I think all of you recognise this and know this, anyway.</p>
<p>"I do have something I'm <em>really</em> excited about. I truly am. And I think you will be, too, I really do think so. But I possibly, uh, misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now. Just please recognise - and I know that you know this - but let me remind you, I guess: I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that. I'm just reminding you. I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that. So please know that.</p>
<p>"And again, I still think that, uh, a lot of you are going to be really excited about this news. Absolutely. Also, I can't share it with you yet. And I'm so sorry," he finished. "But I truly am that excited. That's all I'm gonna say about that right now."</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, fans noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/">a main cast reunion was scheduled for the National Gaming Expo</a> in Tampa, Florida, from 8th-10th August, leading some to think this could be the "announcement" he was excited about (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-version-tease-turns-out-to-be-a-cast-reunion">Push Square</a>). The line-up for that was announced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJIHHW6Szuw/">several weeks back</a>, though, which doesn't quite track with Wiethoff's timeline.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, the announcement has seemingly been delayed. Going by Wiethoff's original tease, we should've finally found out by yesterday, 20th June. However, when asked by a fan today, 21st June, for an update, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lgwq77/the_announcement_is_yet_to_happen_according_to/#lightbox">replied</a>: "It's coming. Sorry for the delay. Ha! There are a lot of moving parts. We want to get this right. I think it will be clear why once we're able to say what's going on.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, I want to tell you as soon as possible. Ha! I love it. Let's goooooooo!"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-says-he-possibly-misled-some-people-but-insists-exciting-news-is-still-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As it stands, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is not doing so hot. Across the board it's not been received entirely positively (including by our own James, you can read his review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">here</a>), not exactly the ideal launch for a live service game. All the same, it being a live service game might ultimately be its benefit thanks to the power of that mystical force called "updates." In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274">Steam post</a> shared by the FBC: Firebreak team, some planned improvements were outlined, which certainly sound like they'd make for a better experience.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First of all, the team made one thing clear: the game "will improve." Remedy explained that they've been listening to all of the feedback so far, and asked for any more that anyone might have. In terms of immediate plans for changes, the first thing they list is improving the first hour experience. They acknowledge that this is due to a "combination of things," like poor onboarding, how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> systems actually work, clarity in what to do in jobs, and there being too much of a grind for higher-tier weapons.
</p>
<p>
In terms of onboarding, Remedy plan to better communicate the "synergies between Crisis Kits and giving players much better information on what to do in the Jobs and how to be more effective in doing the work that Firebreakers must do." That means harmful conditions, like being on fire, being more readable. 
</p>
<p>
A new patch that arrived yesterday has already made it easier to access jobs, as you no longer need to play the first two clearance levels of each job, and completing the full job unlocks the next full job. The patch has also made Lost Assets and Research Samples more highlighted visually, so that it's harder to miss them. It's also rebalanced how much all of the unlockables cost too, and things like Altered Augments, Improvised Devices, and powerful weapons are easier to access. All of this was done to help with dealing with that grind.
</p>
<p>
There's a few more specifics in the Steam post you can read for yourself, and you can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920272?l=english">here</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-fans-now-is-the-time-to-get-into-magic-the-gathering.1224807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering</a> </em>set is here, and there’s never been a more perfect assemblage of <em>Magic</em> cards. The set features cards taken from every mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> title, including the two MMOs, so there’s something for every generation of <em>Final Fantasy</em> lovers. And while <em>Magic</em> has featured other video game crossovers in the past (hello, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Fallout</em>!), with the way this set is constructed, from card mechanics to art, you can tell this one is a developer favorite, sure to appeal to the massive chunk of people who love both games. </p><p>But what if you don’t inhabit the center circle in the Venn diagram of<em> Magic</em> and <em>Final Fantasy </em>lovers but are still interested in experiencing this set for yourself? <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is an intimidating game, even if you’re a seasoned player like myself. There are so many ways you can play, both in person and online, that it can be overwhelming to figure out the best way to jump in. So here’s a few tips and tricks to playing the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic</em> set. </p><p>Be warned, though: this is the best-selling set in<em> Magic</em>’s 30-plus-year history, and you will pay for the pleasure of this experience — if you can find the product to pay for it at all. </p><p><strong>How to play: physical edition</strong></p><p>Over the years, the designers at <em>Magic</em> developer Wizards of the Coast have realized it can be intimidating as hell for a new player looking to start their planeswalking journey. To help these new players along, <em>Magic</em> developers have created a line of products called Starter Kits. Each is a set of two 60-card decks featuring cards specifically designed for new players and an instruction booklet that goes over the game’s basic rules and cadence of play. Keep one deck for yourself, give one to a friend, and learn as you play together. For <em>MTG x FF</em>, the starter kit features two decks themed around <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s greatest rivalry: <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-starter-kit-decklists">Sephiroth vs. Cloud</a>.</p><p>These decks are a decent introductory course to <em>Magic</em>. Cloud’s is themed around equipment cards (think the Buster Sword or the Ultima Weapon), which are essentially weapons you can attach to your creatures to pump up their damage and hit hard. Sephiroth’s deck is all about him. Kill creatures (yours and your opponent’s) to make him as big as possible. I played both decks against the set’s designers and managed to beat them both, a monumental feat for any <em>Magic</em> player. However, if you want to play them for yourself, the Starter Kit is currently sold out on Amazon, so your best bet to find one is to hit up your local card shop (known in the community as your LCS) to see if it has any in stock. Wizards’ website does feature <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/">a handy store locator</a> if you don’t know where your nearest LCS is. </p><p>There are also <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists">four Commander decks</a> you can buy and play, with each one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">themed around a specific title in the series</a>. Commander is the most popular format of <em>Magic</em>, but the rules are slightly different from standard play, and matches can often include more than one opponent. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks are beginner-friendly but expensive, running anywhere from $80 to $130 when Commander decks in other sets are much cheaper.</p><p><strong>How to play: online edition</strong></p><p>If you don’t have any friends you can beg, bribe, or beat into playing <em>Magic</em> with you, there is another, far easier option: the game’s online version, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>. <em>Arena</em> is the best way to experience the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set as there’s no worry about stock, it’s relatively cheaper, and there are so many different ways to play that in-person playing simply does not accommodate. Once you’ve made your account and downloaded the game, you can play through the game’s tutorial, which I recommend to get your bearings. Not only does it explain how to play, but the color challenges also give you a feel for the playstyles of <em>Magic</em>’s five different colors.</p><div><div><p id="choosing-your-slice-of-the-color-pie"><h2>Choosing your slice of the color pie</h2></p></div><p>Think of colors and color combos as characters in your favorite hero shooter. Each has different abilities and favors a specific style of play. Blue and white center on going over your opponents’ heads with flying creatures, while mono green (my favorite and the best way to play) favors big, stompy creatures that run over your opponents’ defenses. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set makes it easy to find a color or combo that works for you.</p></div><p>If you want to get straight into the <em>Final Fantas</em>y set, you can simply skip the tutorial to unlock all of <em>Arena</em>’s many game modes and features, and it’ll still be there to try if you ever need to go back. </p><p>Once you’re ready, you have a number of options available. You can get right into the thick of things and start playing the game’s constructed modes. If you’ve never played <em>Magic</em> before, do not do this. It is expensive, costing a lot of resources your account will not have unless you buy them in the game’s cash shop, and it is hard. Making decks is difficult; even I don’t like it that much compared to playing decks preassembled for me.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Some of my favorite cards from this set. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Your best, most economical option is to play Jumpstart mode. In Jumpstart all the hard work of making a viable deck is done for you. You are presented with a number of archetypes: Bold, Mage, Chocobos, Equipment, and more. You can pick two of them based on nothing more than vibes and personal preference, and the game will automatically create a deck using those two archetypes. Then you play your deck against other Jumpstart decks and rack up the wins or the valuable experience that comes with losing.</p><p>The great thing about Jumpstart is that it’s cheap — a new account grants you enough currency to try the mode three times — and the cards you pick are yours to keep. Do it enough times and you’ll eventually have enough cards to tool around with making your own decks to try out in the game’s friendly mode, Quick Start. I’ve enjoyed all the different Jumpstart decks I’ve made, but if you really wanna have some fun, pick chocobos whenever you get the chance. They’re creatures that get stronger whenever you play a land card (think of land like the gas that powers your deck’s engine) and have incredible synergy with other card types, leading to a deck that <em>will</em> overwhelm your opponent.</p><p>Also, they’re chocobos! What could be more <em>Final Fantasy</em> than chocobos?</p><p>If you are a <em>Final Fantasy </em>fan, I cannot stress enough how much fun its <em>Magic </em>set is. And if you’re intimidated by <em>Magic</em>’s difficulty, don’t be. There are so many beginner-friendly ways to play, and there are so many beginners trying this set out for the first time, that you’ll be in good company. Plus, I’ve found the community is always happy to help newcomers. When I played at an in-person event, my first opponent had never picked up the game before. Over the course of our match I taught him everything I knew as best I could, and before the end, he beat me. Badly. I’ve never had more fun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hypnospace Outlaw developer Jay Tholen has confirmed the highly anticipated sequel, Dreamsettler, has been cancelled following a "mutual" decision between Tholen and publisher No More Robots.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of a YouTube video entitled: "Dreamsettler is canceled".</p>
<p>"I didn't want to make a video like this, but I'll cut to the chase - Dreamsettler has been cancelled," he said in the ten-minute video. "It means it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."</p>

<p>Before going into details, however, Tholen thanks everyone who had signed up to his recently launched Patreon, saying going to the crowdfunding platform was "kind of a last-ditch effort." Refunds will be available for the most recent month's payment.</p>
<p>Tholen also said that while he wasn't currently sure "what form it'll take", he does intend to release more of what would have been in the game, which could possibly include a playable build. He also issued a passionate plea for studios to get in touch and offer work to the two developers who have been let go due to the cancellation.</p>
<p>"The very short version is: we got a budget this time, we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time. Because of that money [...] you have to go by this schedule, and I've never successfully made a game based on a design document."</p>
<p>He then talked about some of his favourite features of Dreamsettler, such as Oomph, a fake music sequencer, but the team "way over-scoped, things were so complicated and so fancy".</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry to everyone who's waiting for this game and expecting a big, great game," Tholen added. "This is, like, almost five years of my life. I mean, I did make [spin-off game] Slayer X, so that was a fun diversion, but this was the big one. I had so many hopes."</p>
<p>For those wondering, yes, The Chowder Man was going to return. "He recorded more music for this game than Hypnospace," Thorlen said, "and I want to do right by the musicians too, so maybe we'll figure out how to release their music and promote it.</p>
<p>"We just needed to stop this. Because of money and practical concerns, I just had to stop it. Hopefully, we can release some of it, or maybe I can write blogs - or some of the team can - and show you what we were doing because there's a lot of cool stuff there. A lot of worthwhile stuff."</p>
<p>Thorlen said he still plans to work on Slayer's next update, with hopes to get it out early next year.</p>
<p>"Maybe I've been burnt out this whole time. I don't know. I was able to do Slayer X, though I would like to do kids' stuff. Stuff for children. I don't know if it would be a video series, or an app for kids, or something. And it's not because I think this is a great market to get into, but it's because there are things I've searched for and they don't exist, and I want to make them, just for my own kids.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, everyone. This just stinks. Again, I want to emphasise the publisher did a great job, Mike and Mark did an excellent job. I think I'm a hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."</p>
<p>We discovered Hypnospace Outlaw would be getting a sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettlers">back in 2022</a>. Another game, Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer - a spin-off made by the fictitious Hypnospace Outlaw character, Zane - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-spin-off-slayers-x-gets-june-release-date">released in June 2023</a>.</p>
<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-review-resurrecting-a-forgotten-internet-warts-and-all">Hypnospace Outlaw a hearty Recommended</a> when it released in 2019, writing: "A witty and smitten recreation of a time gone by, which you'll forgive tedium if you share in the nostalgia."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettler-cancelled-as-creator-issues-heartfelt-statement-maybe-ive-been-burnt-out-this-whole-time]]></content:encoded>
