Genki’s parent company, Human Things, will pay Nintendo an undisclosed amount of money in damages to close the case, according to a <a href="https://t.co/VETArfNCMZ">legal filing submitted on Monday</a>, and has agreed to stop giving its products names that are “confusingly similar” to official Nintendo intellectual property.</p><p>The dispute began in January after Genki showed off an accurate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed Switch 2 mockup</a> at CES, even including the console’s logo, days before it was officially launched by Nintendo. The company also began to promote its range of Switch 2 accessories before the console was announced.</p><p>Nintendo later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">filed a complaint</a> against the accessory maker in May over alleged “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.” Nintendo said it didn’t provide Genki with technical Switch 2 specifications, and alleged that Genki either “unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2” prior to the console’s public release, or “cannot claim compatibility with enough certainty to make its advertising claims in good faith.”</p><p>The financial terms of the settlement haven’t been disclosed. According to the settlement filing, Genki attests that it “did not obtain access to” a Switch 2 before the console’s launch announcement, and the origins of the 3D-printed dummy unit remain unclear.</p><p>In the original lawsuit filing, Nintendo said that Genki had also infringed its trademark by marketing third-party accessories and services using language that alluded to Nintendo’s IP, such as “Genki Direct,” and “Genki Glitch 2.” Nintendo accused Genki of “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Genki is still permitted to reference Nintendo branding in its own products in a “nominative fair use manner” under the new settlement agreement, but only when the company is making verified compatibility claims or to clarify its affiliation with Nintendo products as a third-party accessory producer.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement]]></content:encoded>

Somewhat coincidentally, Tencent had actually reached out to see whether we be interested in discussing how the company is attempting to create original franchises with global appeal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a compelling pitch. Tencent, after all, has acquired and invested in a litany of major studios such as Riot Games, Supercell, Frontier Developments, Paradox Interactive, Ubisoft, Epic Games, Remedy Entertainment, and more—but the company is evidently keen to start producing more widely recognized titles in-house.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's Tencent Games division, which shelters its publishing arm and internal studios, debuted a number of original projects at Gamescom itself including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Delta Force</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fate Trigger</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings: World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project Spectrum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Tencent hopes those titles and others will coalesce to create an original catalog that allows its internal teams to work on projects they're furiously passionate about while catering to different player communities around the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-need-to-pick-our-battles-the-chinese-room-boss-says-cost-conscious-development-holds-the-key-to-the-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to pick our battles:' The Chinese Room boss says cost-conscious development is the future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an approach that sounds solid on paper, but how is Tencent actively working to turn that vision into reality—and, perhaps more pertinently in the wake of Sony's lawsuit, ensure its original franchises actually innovate?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating&quot;derivative&quot; titles">Tencent exec says internal studios don't harbor ambitions of creating"derivative" titles</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Zhu, who oversees operations, strategy, and compliance across Tencent's global portfolio of studios, Tencent believes it is vital to match developers to projects they actually care about. "I think one of the things we look at a lot is, not just the IP itself, but more the talent within the studio," explains Zhu. "For us we ask 'what are they able to do and what are they passionate about?' One of the big things we look to do is make sure the studio and the scope and ambition of the project fits within he context of what [the team] is able to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Take studios like Sharkmob with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Exoborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's a relatively newly-formed studio, but they have launched a game previously and so for us the ambition is quite big. Also, we believe the market is there for the taking—and they are passionate about making first-person shooters."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Passion, of course, is probably the one resource that remains abundant within the game industry. In an era of studio closures, financing woes, and widespread layoffs, converting passion into a tangible products that can deliver sustainable returns remains a huge challenge. To minimize the inherent risk that comes with making video games in 2025, Zhu explains Tencent has adopted a data-driven approach that attempts to break down market trends and player expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/evil-empire-tells-devs-to-avoid-early-access-unless-their-project-is-90-percent-complete" target="_self" data-discover="true">Evil Empire tells devs to avoid early access unless their project is 90 percent complete</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We support [our teams] with data," he continues, explaining that Tencent pulls information from a "bunch of different places" including video game data platform Newzoo. "We consolidate all of that and then we internally have data scientists that work with us to do some predictive modelling to provide an understanding of where the market and trends are. We also have a group within Tencent that looks at game research. They are experts on games. They look at trends and what people are interested in. So, there's the game part, the data part, and then the audience part that we're building in as well—which is 'how do we engage with player bases earlier on to test an idea?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu says connecting with audiences prematurely, however, can be "dangerous." Especially when a studio is trying to create something new. It might be safe to bring players into the loop early if you're looking to make inroads into an established genre or market, but if a studio is eager to stray from the well-trodden path that feedback might become less valuable.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that note, we ask Zhu how Tencent distinguishes between inspiration and imitation? We acknowledge Tencent can't comment on Sony's ongoing lawsuit, but feel its important to understand how the company is working to marry its data-driven approach to franchise developments with its desire to create truly original titles that resonate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think most of the developers that we work with are confident in their abilities," says Zhu in response. "They are always looking to create something new and different. Their first thoughts are not 'what is derivative?' In fact, I think some of the research that we give them covers [...] features or UI that are a bit more technical or specific, versus IP itself. I don't think we, and a lot of the studios that I work with personally, have that ambition of 'we want to create a derivative IP from something else.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tencent believes mitigating risk is about &quot;matching the pitch to the market&quot;">Tencent believes mitigating risk is about "matching the pitch to the market"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking big swings also requires financial risk. Tencent evidently has plenty in the coffers, but Zhu explains the conglomerate is strict about moderating its investment level to ensure those risks feel sustainable. "When there are big challenges and unknowns on a project, we control our investment level. We answer all of the [pressing] questions first before going big," he continues, noting how Tencent works to garner a deep understanding of gameplay elements, narrative beats, and the potential for fun (which feels like the big one) before pulling the trigger.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu feels risk mitigation is also about "matching the pitch to the market." Certain genres, he explains, are always going to be more risky. "If you look at an open-world game, the investment into that before you even get to a minute of gameplay is going to be much bigger than if you were to look at a PvP shooter where you can quickly iterate," he adds. "The bar for investing into different types of games is going to be different, and the number of games we greenlight in certain genres versus others is going to be proportional to the risk level."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those projects that do make it through the production slalom at Tencent are expected to deliver. Zhu explains the ultimate goal is "evergreen" growth, and while that phrase will undoubtedly mean different things depending on the size and scale of individual titles, the company's aim is to cultivate franchises capable of matching its own long-term vision.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you talk about growth [...] I think our ultimate goal is evergreen, right? You look at League of Legends, you look at PUBG Mobile, you look at even Fortnite. These are long-sustaining products that are always in the ecosystem," he says. "That doesn't mean it will limit growth, though, because that creates opportunities to build out other things. Look at League of Legends and how its gone into Arcane and other genres. I think that's one example, and we're definitely look to do the same thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the projects that fail to reach those heights, Zhu claims any cancellation is the result of a thorough vetting process as opposed to knee-jerk reactions. "We take our time [when making those calls]. It's years. It depends on the game, depends on the team, and depends on the genre—but ultimately we give the teams the opportunity to go back out to the player base and test again, and repeatedly do that, to understand how we are course correcting towards that north star.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some ideas you know early on. You're like 'this doesn't make sense' and you probably have to kill that idea and move onto the next one. That doesn't mean that dev teams don't have a ton of other things in the pipeline. Other games, you do have to make tough decisions because, even with games in development, because you feel they'll maybe never reach the level of ambition that we have. But for the most part we greenlight games because we truly believe in those teams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Team Cherry has revealed details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first patch, which will make the early game a little easier.
</p>
<p>
That will be welcome news to those playing the game, as it's proven to be extremely challenging. And not just for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-developers-are-trolling-players-with-a-seemingly-safe-haven">its trick bench</a>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, a couple of early bosses will have "slight difficulty reduction", on top of other enemies receiving damage reduction, and some increases in rosary rewards.

<p>Who's the boss of Uranus?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We've spent a whole big chunk of time reviewing and playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> over the past month or so (let this writer tell you) and we thought — we genuinely absolutely thought — we'd seen it all.</p>
<p>However (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/08/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-has-an-insane-secret-boss/">Forbes</a> for the hot tip), it seems one very, very, very...very well hidden boss escaped our metallic clutches on our playthrough. Yep. It's one of those ones where you wonder just how on earth anyone ever actually found it.</p>
<p>Indeed, by travelling eight hours — that's eight human hours in the real-life world, not video game hours, or even dog hours — straight upwards at Uranus (heh) Tower in the game's Forest region, you'll find another great big Arsenal (heh) battle on a platform that is in with a shout as the highest in any video game. Surely?</p>
<p>Now we haven't tried this yet, because it'll take ages, and we can just watch the video at the top of this very article. Honestly, having already beaten the biggest bosses in the main game, and upon hearing there's nothing special in terms of drops for your trouble on this one...well, how about <em>you</em> go fight it and report back? How does that sound?</p>
<p>If you're game, all you need do is head to the forest region, and take the door in the top right area that leads to an elevator for the tower. However, you're gonna have to manually fly up, which is the bit that takes so long. Once you've done the tricky bit (and those fine folk over at Forbes do suggest letting your Switch 2 go into sleep mode so you can have a break), you'll face off against the All-Seeing One.</p>
<p>Sounds like a right nosy arse, so best let them have it, all guns and/or laser swords blazing.</p>

            <p>Ok, that was quick. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has been out less than a week, and no less than two modders have already had a crack at getting multiplayer working in it, so you can take on those pesky bosses with some co-op aid or moral support.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. After all, the Skong modding scene has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">exploded out of the gates</a> with the same level of gusto folks have had for just playing the base version of the long-awaited metroidvania. Then again, it's one thing for folks to be putting out a bunch of smaller scale tweaks that can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-and-tricks">help make things easier</a>, and another for them to turn a one player game into a more than one player game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These first two Skong multiplayer mods to hit the Nexus are the wonderfully named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/73?tab=description">SilklessCoop</a> (if you get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">the reference</a>) by Nek5, and the more 'does what it says on the tin' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/90?tab=description">Silksong Steam multiplayer mod</a> from 233xvx233. Both aim to accomplish the same thing: letting you and a friend load into the same version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> for double the Hornets, and at least be able to see each other as you work your way through the game.</p>
<p>As you can see below, both mods' authors have posted videos proving that you can use their works to do that at the very minimum, though it appears taking on bosses together might still be beyond the early proofs-of-concept. 233xvx233's work does promise "basic pvp" in its description, but the sole clip they've shared thus far doesn't feature any fighting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nek5 has shown off some battling, with a 'main' Hornet and their less saturated buddy jumping around near a spear-chucking foe, but I can't make out the second Hornet actually landing any hits or taking damage. Regardless, even being able to bounce around with your mate's pretty impressive at this stage.</p><p>In terms of setup, SilklessCoop relies on the <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/">BepInEx modding framework</a> and a server utility being <a href="https://github.com/nek5s/echoserver">hosted on GitHub</a>. Judging by the comments section, getting a server up and running for you and your friend can be as tricky a task as playing Skong, even with the description's instructions. Given that, I'd maybe steer clear for now or take it slow if you're a relative modding novice. </p>
<p>As you'd expect at this early stage, the modder also notes some teething issues, like disconnecting mid-session leaving "unmoving duplicates" of Hornet that only disappear when you chance scenes, plus some attack animations going a bit weird. They're also planning to flesh it out with better sync, an arrow to indicate when one of your duo wanders off sceen, and "public servers hosted by me". Though, they do describe that last one as "scary + expensive", which makes it sound like more of a maybe.</p>
<p>The instructions for 233xvx233's mod are a bit more brief and vague, with a BepInEx folder only mentioned in passing amid some game file messing around and the pinging up of an interface that'll allow folks with an official Steam copy of Skong to set up and join a session together.</p>
<p>There's a good chance the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/Extremelyd1/HKMP">the original Hollow Knight's multiplayer mod</a> might be working on their own more advanced version of co-op Skong, but until then it's cool to see other modders experimenting early doors.</p>

            <p>
Late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata laughed at the prospect of localising the original Animal Crossing, as he believed the game was so specific to Japan it would be too difficult.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">Time Extension</a>, former Nintendo localisation manager Leslie Swan discussed some of the challenges of the job, citing the original Animal Crossing - first released in Japan on N64 as Animal Forest, before a localised version was released in America on the GameCube - as a particularly tricky project.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Takashi Tezuka, who worked as a producer on Animal Crossing, asked Swan to localise the game. She agreed, despite not playing the game herself in advance as she usually would. "But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult'," she said. "And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."
</p>

<p>
She continued: "Then like a month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."
</p><p>
The localisation team had to rename every character, every catchphrase, and all the events, Swan explained. "So we wanted whatever it was to be something that would be useful in as many areas as possible so we would do things like call it 'Fireworks Day' or something so other cultures, not just the US, would be able to use it without it being tied to Independence Day," she said.
</p>
<p>
"Then there were also some items that didn't make sense at all. They would have so much charm in the Japanese version, but they wouldn't have provided the same kind of charm for Western audiences. I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck. We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game."
</p>
<p>
In addition, the legal department had to clear every name, as the team were sure merchandise would be an option if the game sold well.
</p>
<p>
"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan continued. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres', because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."
</p><p>
Hundreds of names were considered, before finalising Animal Crossing. "We really wanted to maintain 'Animal' in the name," said Swan. "And we did try to keep 'Forest' in the name too, but legal told us, 'No, that's not going to happen'."
</p>
<p>
Swan was also the voice of Princess Peach in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>, in addition to working in the localisation team and on Nintendo Power. Eventually, she left Nintendo and retired in 2016.
</p>
<p>
"I have to say, I was so lucky to be able to work at Nintendo," she reflected. "It was a lot of work. It was a lot of stress. But one of the things that kept me there as long as I stayed was I just felt like I was learning something new with every single product we worked on. There was new technology and there was always something new to be learned, and the teams I worked with were just so energetic. The whole of the company was just oozing energy. It felt like such a family."

            <title><![CDATA[Peglin Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/09/peglin-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peglin-review.1292247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Peglin is a roguelike pachinko game. If you’re not familiar, pachinko games are where you shoot a ball from the top of the screen to hit and bounce between as many pegs as possible for points. It’s a simple concept, and one that gave rise to the hugely popular Peggle games, but where that series has faded into our memories, Peglin is looking to revisit and spice things up with more items, ball types, bonuses and monster battles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Peglin | Official Trailer | Coming to PlayStation and Xbox on May 1st" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfrCQ7tOZPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Peglin, your points don’t just go toward a high score, but are instead translated into damage that is then dealt to enemies. These enemies are shown at the top of the screen and take their turns in between balls you throw, moving closer to you until they’re in range, then attacking to take chunks out of your health. Naturally, once your health drops to zero, it’s game over and you start another run, hopefully slightly more savvy than before.</p>


<p>You’ll want to keep an eye on the R pegs and the exclamation mark pegs, which are refreshes and criticals, respectively. A refresh will replace all the pegs that have been hit on the board, which is very helpful as you quickly start to run out, causing you to deal less damage. Criticals don’t deal damage themselves, but they cause all pegs hit to deal their critical damage rather than their standard damage, and it applies retroactively for all pegs hit by that particular ball. There are also bomb pegs, which after being hit twice causes you to drop an actual bomb that damages all enemies for 50 damage, which is exceptionally helpful, while coin orbs give you cash that can be spent on new orbs, upgrading the ones you have, or healing yourself between fights.</p>


<p>It’s not all enemies and pachinko though, as you’re working your way down a map, moving between different types of encounters by shooting a ball into the right hole to pick a path to follow. The chest icon means you’ll find some treasure, some of which can have very powerful effects on gameplay. A question mark is a random encounter that could be anything from a chance to upgrade or acquire new balls, an opportunity to acquire some treasure, or just another fight. Meanwhile, a skull on the map is a fight, and an even bigger skull is a boss fight, whilst the very bottom area will be the boss. Defeat that boss and you’ll move onto the next map; complete all three maps and you’ll beat the game!</p>
<p>I actually achieved this on my first try, which was a surprise for both the genre and for me, if I’m honest. The thing is, you then get access to the Cruciball, which is a series of escalating challenges to make things more difficult, unlocking more Cruciballs as you complete each one. But what does difficulty mean in a pachinko machine? Nothing, so instead the game just introduces frustrations. Technically these do make it more challenging, but not really in an entertaining way, as you now just start with less health, one less critical peg, decreased bomb damage, or a particularly bad ball to be stuck with. These challenges might be satisfying to overcome in a more consistent game, but the balancing in Peglin is all over the place.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I didn’t win my first run of Peglin because I’m a genius – I’m quite the opposite – but because I got lucky with the randomised options that the game gave to me on that run. That’s nice and all, but the opposite has also happened, where a run was basically a waste of time because the items I was given to choose from didn’t complement the ones I’d already gotten, or the one run where I kept being given healing balls instead of damaging ones, causing me no not even make it off the first map.</p>

<p>When a run goes well you can end up with incredibly effective setups, to the point where it feels almost like cheating. Such as when I found an item that added two additional balls every time I fired one which, combined with electric balls that trigger nearby pegs and another item that caused there to be many more refresh pegs. It didn’t even matter that it restricted my aim to four directions, because I was practically carpet bombing pegs that were constantly being refreshed, dealing thousands of damage points at times. But when it goes badly it always feels like it isn’t your fault and, after this happens a few times, you begin to realise that the same must apply to the wins as well, which means you are not really winning, you’re just facilitating the game winning against itself by aiming some balls as best you can.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, because it is often fun. There is a great variety to the types of balls you can play with, each with their own pun. The Infernorb, for example, is lighter than other orbs and on fire, so it triggers bombs in one hit, whilst the Icircle pierces through an enemy during its attack and through the first peg it hits on the board, and the Memorb deals additional damage for each peg hit so far by any orb. There are a lot of them as well. When you get a new orb you add it to your inventory and whilst you’re in combat they’ll be played in a randomly chosen order. Once you’ve used them all, you’ll have to reload and the enemies will get an extra turn.</p>
<p>The items can be very powerful as well, encouraging you to completely change the way you’re playing in some cases. But the game is just too random, so you often don’t find things that complement each other and can’t really complete a run. After this happens a few times the fun fades a little from the experience, because you’re losing due to things outside of your control. You can play custom mode, where you’ll be able to choose which items you want available from what you’ve already found whilst playing, which is nice. It does feel a bit like tailoring the game into an easy mode if you choose all the effective ones and exclude the ones you don’t like though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Genki advertised its products well before the official reveal</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f8b2a468a1cd/genki-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the start of the year, as the hype around Switch 2 was beginning to reach fever pitch, accessory manufacturer Genki began to prematurely advertise its products for the then-upcoming console. Perhaps most notably, it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/genki-is-hosting-its-own-switch-2-accessories-direct-later-today">broadcasting its own 'Direct'</a> on the same day Nintendo revealed all regarding its new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo, as you can imagine, wasn't best pleased about having its plans revealed early, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">proceeded to file a lawsuit against Genki</a>, claiming that the latter had "demoed and promoted unauthorised purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories". It also claimed Genki violated its trademarks by using names similar to the Switch, e.g. Glitch and Glitch 2.</p>
<p>Now, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">official court documents</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1965259917335343375">OatmealDome</a>), Nintendo and Genki have reached a settlement, with Genki required to pay an undisclosed amount of damages.</p>
<p>A key segment of the document reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant (Genki) represents and attests that it did not obtain access to any of Plaintiff’s (Nintendo) property (e.g., including but not limited to an unreleased Switch 2 or any documents, files, consoles, or accessories relating thereto) prior to the Plaintiff’s First Look Trailer or official launch of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>"The parties have resolved Plaintiff’s claims in this action pursuant to a separate confidential settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) that operates in conjunction with this Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction (“Consent Judgment”)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the agreement, Genki is required to refrain from using any logos or names that might be deemed confusingly similar to that of Nintendo's. It's also prohibited from using the terms 'Glitch', 'Glitch 2', 'Genki Direct', and 'Genki Indirect' when advertising its products, and indeed, if you head to the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/collections/ns2-accessories">company's website</a> right now, you'll see no mention of any of these.</p>
<p>Genki must also refrain from using specific colour schemes in its packaging and marketing that may be deemed too similar to Nintendo's core identity. Essentially, Genki needs to ensure that consumers are fully aware of its status as an unlicensed manufacturer.</p>
<p>Another win for Nintendo then, and let's be honest, who here didn't see this coming?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's little doubt that Hollow Knight: Silksong is another smashing success for indie developer Team Cherry. Following the award-winning release of Hollow Knight in 2017, the Australian team immediately set to work on the sequel, which, however, was delayed several times, worrying fans in the process.</p>



<p>Now that it's out on PC and consoles, though, Hollow Knight: Silksong has already garnered widespread acclaim and broken records. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-breaks-players-peak-gets-luma-hdr-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> a few days ago that it had surpassed 562K concurrent players on Steam, and that was just one platform. </p>



<p>Today, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/silksong-passed-5m-players-in-three?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> more in-depth data about the game's popularity. According to Alinea, the game has already passed five million players across all platforms in three days, including over a million just on console Game Pass. Most of those players came from Steam, though, where over three million players purchased the game, generating around $50 million in revenue.</p>



<p>That is perhaps not unexpected, given that Hollow Knight: Silksong had been included in the Steam wishlists of 5.2 million users, more than any game scheduled to launch this year. Alinea Analytics data reveals that the US, China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil were the top countries on Steam, while the PlayStation audience is different: 30% from North America, 14% from Western Europe, and 14% from Eastern Asia.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The genuine surprise came from the fact that the game's audience apparently overlaps with Soulslike fans, as shown in the infographics above. Despite the different genre, they clearly enjoy the game's tight, challenging gameplay.</p>



<p>2025 was another strong year so far for indie games, but Hollow Knight: Silksong outsold them all by a considerable margin. Alinea Analytics reports that, after three days, these were the four best-selling games on Steam:</p>



<ul>
<li>R.E.P.O. - 253K units</li>



<li>PEAK - 332K units</li>



<li>Schedule - 858K units</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong - 3 million units</li>
</ul>



<p>Having said that, Silksong came with a lot of hype, whereas the others only became popular over time after their respective releases. As such, a more appropriate comparison will have to wait.</p>

While plenty of YouTube and TikTok videos have blamed Microsoft for the issues, Phison has identified “early versions of firmware and BIOS” as the problem instead.</p><p>“Many of the reports originate from media testing conducted on hardware running early versions of firmware and BIOS,” says Michael Wu, GM and President of Phison US, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “These versions are performance preview drives and are not identical to those provided to end users through official distribution channels. We have observed that outdated firmware is still being used on some SSDs and we encourage any reviewers facing this to leverage updated channel firmware readily available through manufacturer-provided update utilities.”</p><p>YouTuber JayzTwoCents <a href="https://youtu.be/TbFIUu_7LIc">claimed last week</a> that the “Windows update and SSD problem is WAY worse than we thought!” JayzTwoCents showed a Crucial T500 drive (with a Phison E25 controller) failing after Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 security updates, and needing a power cycle to come back to life. It’s not clear whether JayzTwoCents was using pre-release SSD firmware, or even an early motherboard BIOS.</p><p>Phison was able to replicate issues reported by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hkepc/permalink/2301321666981945/">PCDIY! community</a> though, and found that these were down to engineering preview firmware. “Phison examined the exact SSDs used in the PCDIY! testing and determined PCDIY! was utilizing an engineering preview firmware, which is not the final firmware used in the Corsair Force Series MP600 SSD 2TB and other drives with the E16 controller available for sale to consumers on the market,” explains Wu. Phison also performed the same tests on consumer SSDs and found no crashes or failures.</p><p>Microsoft said late last month that it had “found no connection” between its security updates and the drive failures reported on social media and elsewhere. That didn’t stop many people, including prominent YouTubers, from blaming Microsoft for the SSD issues. That’s hardly surprising though, given Microsoft’s history of chaotic Windows updates.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774201/phison-windows-11-ssd-issues-early-firmware#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/774201/phison-windows-11-ssd-issues-early-firmware]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3, or whatever they call the follow-up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, may have a social hub in the style of Destiny's Tower, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has told the Helldiverati in a new Q&amp;A.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I realize it's probably never gonna be a thing in HD2, but for the next game I'd really appreciate a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny)," asked one of the assembled Hadesplungers on Discord this Sunday. To which Jorjani <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1414308725400801489">succinctly responded</a>: "It's on the feature list for the next one." Goodness, that sounds rather definitive.</p>
<p>If, like me, you are a closet fascist bully-boy masquerading as a shy and retiring centrist role-playing as an openly fascist bully-boy in a videogame, your mind has immediately gravitated to the prospect of parades. If Helldivers 3 has a social hub with a hefty playercount, then it absolutely needs a parade ground. I've always fancied myself a latter-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheisskopf">Lieutenant General Scheisskopf</a>. I want to be able to turn my head and salute in synch with scores of fellow divers as we strut past the presidential podium.</p>
<p>Come on, Arrowhead, there's a proper minigame to explore here! Let the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> fill their hubs with beachballs and supersoakers. Leave mingleplayer to the hippies who play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>What else do caped brownshirts do when they're chillaxing back at base, or perhaps aboard a proper space cruiser like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rx8_vjbXX4">the ones in Starship Troopers</a>? Well, we could organise our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">Two Minutes Hate</a> sessions, with players gathering to screech and gibber at videos of squid running at a sub-optimal frame-rate. </p><p>Beyond that, maybe there could be an in-game feedback system presented as a 'managed' voting booth, with special cosmetics awarded to any player willing to take up the handcuffs, gavel and taser of a Super-Earth elections officer. Maybe player kicking framed as the denunciation of traitors? Please, fill the comments with your comparably dystopic suggestions. We'll make Jorjani rue his words.</p>
<p>The Arrowhead CEO has previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">Helldivers 3 is "hopefully many years away"</a>, not least because there's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">plenty that needs fixing in Helldivers 2</a>.</p>

            <p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s cute character designs may suggest something light and effortless, do not be fooled. Silksong is not an easy game to play. In fact, it is darn difficult, requiring plenty of precision, be it platforming of fighting.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Team Cherry has popped a number of benches throughout Silksong, where the game's protagonist Hornet (and the player), can take some weight off and recover from the perils that have come before, before heading once more out into the fray. Except, when the team hasn't…</p>
<p>You see, many players have come to realise that Team Cherry has in fact planted at least one trick bench in the depths of Silksong, that doesn't really play fair (<strong>please read no further if you do not want to know where</strong>).</p>

<p>Silksong's trick bench can be found in Hunter's March, which itself is found off The Marrow. As with many other areas in Silksong, it is tricky. It's an area you can do early on, but should probably come back to with more upgrades to actually have a better chance of getting through. Needless to say, when you get to a bench, you will likely feel a sense of relief, and want to finally pause and take a breather. Except this trick bench will scupper that breather, and when Hornet sits on it she will activate a spike trap that will whop a load of health off. Ouch!</p><p>A post on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> reddit titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1nb3721/i_have_no_words_this_is_the_most_anger_i_have/">'I have no words. This is the most anger I have ever felt for any game ever. I had one mask'</a>, with an accompanying picture of the offending bench, has been commented on by many other players who feel a similar amount of anguish (though largely in good humour).</p>
<p>"I was like 'finally, a bench', sat down at two masks and let go of my keyboard.. Died," one reply reads. "My partner was spectating the whole thing and we just laughed for five minutes.</p>
<p>"Damn, the developer had <em>fun </em>making this game for seven years."</p>
<p>You can check out Silksong's bench trap in action via the posts below.</p> <figure>

<p>Thankfully, you can disable the trap, and the trick bench then becomes a regular safe bench. If you head to the left side of the bench before sitting on it, you will come across a lever. Swing Hornet's needle at it, and you will deactivate the spikes (phew).</p>

            <p>It's 9th September - I feel like a human calendar - and we're back with another coagulation of all of today's gaming news and events.</p>
<p>Today's question is: 'Borderlands 4 - are you planning to play it?' Because it's creeping up on us: this major new instalment is out on Friday (12th). And I'm curious: is there excitement among you for it? (I'm low-key trying to gauge who I can play with.)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to insider NatetheHate</a>, Square Enix is preparing to launch Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2 consoles sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The rumor admittedly doesn't come as a huge surprise. The Japanese publisher has long since turned a new leaf from its PlayStation exclusivity days, <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vowing to bring more of its games to other consoles</a> as well. Moreover, the first game in the remake trilogy, Final Fantasy VII Remake, is officially heading to both platforms at some point in this Winter season.</p>



<p>It only stands to reason that the second entry, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, would soon follow. After all, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already made it to PC earlier this year, and its debut on the platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-january-2025s-third-best-selling-game-in-the-us-thanks-to-its-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped the game reach third place in January's Circana best-selling games chart for the United States</a>.</p>



<p>Rebirth also received even higher acclaim from the press and fans alike than its predecessor. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got a rare perfect score</a> from reviewer Kai Tatsumoto:</p>



<p><em>If there’s one word to describe Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Square Enix is of course also working on the third and final chapter of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy. In fact, franchise director Tetsuya Nomura <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured fans</a> just a few days ago that the development is 'on schedule'. We could be looking at a 2028 release window, if the four-year gap between Remake and Rebirth is anything to go by, but it's too early to be any more accurate.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-demo-this-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-demo-later-this-year.1292199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft Massive's open galaxy action/adventure game, launched a year ago to mildly positive reviews from critics. However, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold a lot less than Ubisoft had hoped for</a>, making it a key factor in the publisher's subsequent decision to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows from its original November 2024 release window to March 20, 2025, in a bid to avoid the same fate.</p>



<p>Over time, Massive improved various aspects of the game (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-will-be-patched-to-improve-those-annoying-insta-fail-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annoying stealth missions that instantly failed upon being spotted</a>) and released the two promised story DLCs, A Pirate's Fortune and Wild Card. The game never really bounced back in popularity, though, and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the state of the Star Wars IP played its part in the mixed reception from players.</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws has now just launched on the Nintendo Switch 2, however. On this platform, it has a chance of making a better impression from the get-go since it includes all the free updates and DLCs released up to this point. Moreover, despite worries that the technically advanced game powered by the Snowdrop engine would struggle on the hybrid handheld console, it turns out that Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did a great job at porting the game</a> despite the technical limitations. Now, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1kKhQ1Heps7YmSJdFiV87L/switch-2-release-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that you can expect a free demo to go live soon, in case you want to get a taste of Kay Vess and Nix before purchasing.</p>



<p>If you've enjoyed the game and are hoping this release could spearhead a sequel, though, that ship might have already sailed. According to a recent rumor from Tom Henderson, Ubisoft has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a> that was still in its early development stages and had not entered full production yet. </p>



<p>It's too bad, as this was one of the few Star Wars games not at all centered on Force users. Star Wars 1313 and Project Ragtag were other two such projects, of course, and we all know that both got canceled before ever making it to the market. The only remaining hope is Amy Hennig's untitled Star Wars game, which was announced in April 2022. She is also currently working on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, which is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to launch next year</a>. Chances are we won't learn any more about the Star Wars project until the Marvel one is released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel’s Wolverine Is Looking Fantastic According to Playtesters, Says Insider]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-is-looking-fantastic-according-to-playtesters-says-insider.1292193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, a rumor from Insider Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Insomniac Games and Sony could finally be readying a gameplay reveal for Marvel's Wolverine during another State of Play presentation slated for later this month.</p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during a PlayStation Showcase in September 2021. However, in late 2023, Insomniac Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered a major hack</a> of its staff's personal data and the studio's upcoming projects, chiefly the Wolverine game. This inevitably led to a delay - the game was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting a 2024 or 2025 release window, which clearly did not pan out as originally intended.</p>



<p>The good news for fans of Marvel's Wolverine is that not only is the unveiling close, but according to the same source, Tom Henderson, playtesters have been very impressed with the game. The insider even hinted that the reveal might come with a release date, though that sounds more like a personal hope than hard knowledge. Here's the quote from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebz9vqIyNhc&amp;t=2284s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Insider Gaming podcast</a>:</p>



<p><em>I heard that there was going to be or there is going to be a State of Play towards the end of the month, and then, separately, from a person who I've known for years and has given me the most reliable information you can get, he then said that the Wolverine trailer is done. You put two and two together, it suggests that Marvel's Wolverine trailer is done because it's going to be at the State of Play in September. It might not be. And if it isn't, then possibly The Game Awards. We all know that Geoff Keighley likes his big reveals. Or who knows, maybe there's another event.<br></em><br><em>So, it is done. It obviously was delayed to quite a big extent. From what I've managed to hear, from people working on the project, obviously, the ransomware attack and all the game leaking is one thing, but then the emotional strain that it places on people when you have all of your information leaked, like your address, social security numbers, and all that kind of stuff, is massive. So that obviously delayed the game as well. But from a few playtesters I've been speaking to, they think the game looks fantastic. So that's good news, and fingers crossed we get to see a release date in a couple of weeks' time. </em></p>



<p>We don't really know anything concrete in terms of game features about Marvel's Wolverine. What we do know is that the original Creative Director and Game Director for the project, Brian Horton and Cameron Christian (who had previously worked on 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-ps5-champion-of-the-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a>), were replaced last year by Marcus Smith and Mike Daly, who worked on 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-purpose-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, it has been previously hinted by Marvel's Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 Creative Director Bryan Intihar that there might be a crossover with Wolverine at some point. If we had to guess, though, that could be happening later down the line, and the Friendly Neighborhood superhero probably would only appear as a cameo in Marvel's Wolverine.</p>
