			<p>Hitman World of Assassination has officially reached over 75 million players worldwide, which means that this game is the most successful Hitman game of all time. This new was announced today by IO Interactive, the developer and publisher behind the incredibly popular franchise. Since its launch, Hitman World of Assassination has now surpassed 75 million players worldwide. This milestone is just another checkmark for the team, as they have known the success of the game since it was first released. This title has achieved the franchise's highest Metacritic score with the release of Hitman III in 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the franchise, Hitman World of Assassination is a bit more unique, as it allows players to be stealthy while also getting stuck into dramatic action, and allows players to come up with a multitude of ways to assassinate a target or knock them out and hide them.</p>
<p>The game has plenty of interesting characters to get to know or even assassinate, and there are tons of opportunities to carry out a contract. Hitman World of Assassination doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, either.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN: World of Assassination - The Splitter  (featuring @JCVDWorld ) Mission Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xS2zKlpYVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the release of this game, there have been a ton of updates, adding in new live content that contains new locations, contracts, events, and even collaborations with famous people who then get to become a contract in the game. December saw a million active players, and the game continues to remain popular and played by many. 2025 will get more missions for players to run through, as new updates are released by the team hard at work.</p>
<p>Most recently, players were given the opportunity to see Jean-Claude Van Damme in Hitman World of Assassination as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-cut-ties-with-conor-mcgregor-after-court-ruling/">Elusive Target</a> Max Valliant, who is a former ICA operative and others already thought he had been eliminated years ago, but was found to be alive and dealing with secret organizations. This particular mission has been completed by 40% of the players, with a fair few getting far in the mission but struggling to take down the target thanks to his skill set.</p>
<p>One player in particular took more than seven hours to complete the mission, to make sure that they were as thorough as possible in the mission before assassinating the target. Contrasting this playthrough, the fastest player ended the mission within 21 seconds.</p>
<p>The Splitter will be available in Hitman World of Assassination until January 12, giving players the opportunity to try out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new mission</a> before it disappears.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft are delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, but this time, not just out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">concern about the quality of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow. </p><!--more-->
<p>Quite what this means is open to speculation, but it was recently rumoured that Ubi's First Family the Guillemot brothers have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">conspiring with Tencent to buy the company out</a>, while minority shareholders displeased by the company's falling share price have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">clamouring</a> for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to a strategic investor". So this could be Big. Bigger than a single video game's delay, anyway.</p>
<p>"Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation," reads a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf">"strategic update" from Ubisoft</a>, posted this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft announced today that it has appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders," it continues. "This process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materializes."</p><p>Ubisoft have been somewhat up the creek financially for a while, losing almost half their share value in 2024, partly due to the "soft" performance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. As such they've been cutting back. In December, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">discontinued PvP shooter XDefiant and laid off around 277 people</a>. According to today's statement, shuttering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> involved the closure of "three production studios in high-cost geographies" - as in, regions where wages are higher.</p>
<p>The company "will continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a highly selective approach to investments", the statement goes on. Ubisoft now expect to reduce their "fixed cost base" (in other words, costs that consist of more predictable, recurring business expenses, like employee salaries) by €200 million for the fiscal year 2025-2026, compared to 2022-2023 on an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualize.asp">annualised</a> basis.</p>
<p>And then there's the delaying of Shadows, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">moderately promising historical opus</a> which appears to have far too much riding on it in the wake of Outlaws.</p>
<p>"Additionally, as part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences, it has been decided to provide an additional month of development to Assassin's Creed Shadows," Ubisoft write. "This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community. The game is now scheduled for March 20."</p><p>I do not have the insight to play soothsayer about Ubisoft's fortunes here. I will end instead by pointing you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">this bracingly weary Alice0 (RPS in peace) article from 2022</a>, in which CEO Yves Guillemot talks up Ubisoft's independence while also stating that, of course, they'd happily sell the farm to anybody with a really, really large amount of money.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the creatures just appear alongside the player when summoned.</p><p>The status of the lawsuit is still pending, and it's unclear how it impacts the two companies' relationship.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/locator-demo-geoguessr<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/geoguessr-inspired-detective-game-locator-is-about-puzzles-perspective-and-empathy-on-an-alien-planet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RockPaperShotgun</a>, I checked out the Steam demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2459030/Locator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Locator</em></a>, which calls itself a “<em>Geoguessr</em>-inspired detective game set on an alien planet.” I’m not done with the demo yet, because I am wretched at maps and locating myself in space, but I’ve taken to the site both to tell you about the demo and to get you to play it so you can help me.</p><p>You’re tasked with tracking down the location of a missing archeologist, using her notes and photos to drop pins to recreate her journey across the planet. Things start off not too tough: there’s an obvious crash site with an obvious landmark. Later levels get a little more tricky: which wooden bridge are you standing on, based on where some towers are? I struggled for ages with where to position myself related to a set of stairs by some teleporters, because here is where I admit that despite being a 43-year-old man I still sometimes have to turn my whole body or my phone around to understand how to parse a basic Google Map.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Locator - Early Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_qCQCyxVtE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some levels have little puzzles that involve using the missing archeologist’s notebook. One photo is completely dark, but she’s named the statues she’s near, so you can guess where you might be based on that. The level I’m currently wrangling with involves figuring out where in a cluster of beachside huts I am; the archeologist’s notes tell you that huts can only have one of two kinds of doorways, which is helping me narrow things down somewhat (there are triangle doors in one photo, so I can’t be at the huts I previously IDed as having circle doors), but my brain is trying to do so many things at once: determine which cluster the photo is referring to based on its shape or landmarks, turn the overhead view of the map into the on-the-ground view of the photos, and then imagine walking in this imagined 3D space to figure out an exact location.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Empty Exhibit</figcaption></figure><p><em>Locator</em> validates your guesses in sets of three, so I sometimes ran into the situation of setting myself on the wrong path based on an initial wrong guess before learning it was wrong. When the demo opens up a bit, not restricting you to three puzzles at a time, it’s a little easier to come back to wrong guesses or tricky puzzles. Not all the photos and clues are in order, which adds another level of complication: recreating the chronology of the archeologist’s journey to understand her progression through the photos on top of everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I can see the <em>Geoguessr</em> similarities in the core concept and design, but in its narrative, <em>Locator</em> is very different. To me, the fun in <em>Geoguessr</em> (which I also suck at) is learning about new areas of the world; here, it’s more about the spatial puzzle and locating yourself on the ground than imagining different parts of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a positively abysmal sense of direction despite being someone who regularly propels himself <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great</a><a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> distances</a> on <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1589379291703574529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foot</a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/bike-road-davis-comic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike</a>, which means the constant companion on most of my adventures is Ride With GPS’ “you’re going the wrong way” chime. While playing <em>Locator</em>, I’ve been tilting my head or spinning my chair as I hold a photo and a map in my mind. You, a person who is maybe more fit for basic survival on the corporeal plane than me, might have to do less of this silly choreography. But I’m really digging what <em>Locator</em> is doing and curious to see where the full game goes. There’s no release date yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">m</a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">essage</a> on social media platform X, the new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>release date is March 20th. The game was previously set to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">release on Valentine's Day</a>, having originally been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for a November 2024 launch</a> when it was first unveiled.</p>

<p>In the message, Ubisoft says it's delaying&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>in order to implement "valuable feedback" from the game's community and to "ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march-naoe.jpg?itok=Pj4bWr2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march-naoe.jpg?itok=0fkN3V4N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft reveals a little more of its rationale for delaying&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. The studio says it wants to "create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>community".</p>

<p>This may or may not be a veiled reference to an ongoing controversy surrounding&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, one which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">pertains specifically to co-protagonist Yasuke</a>.</p>

<p>Some have argued that Yasuke is portrayed in a historically inaccurate and disrespectful light in&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, while opponents to that view have argued that the issue is a dog whistle which hides unsavory prejudicial views on the part of its proponents.</p>

<p>Of course, it's also worth noting that in the press release, Ubisoft says holiday sales for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>were "lower than expected", which may have caused the company to panic and push <i>Shadows&nbsp;</i>back in order to ensure it's in a better state at launch to drive sales.</p>




<p>Last time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>was delayed, Ubisoft admitted that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed, and it's likely that a tentpole release with a major IP attached to it achieving low sales is a huge driver for the company wanting to ensure&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is a success.</p>

<p>Ubisoft also says in the aforementioned press release that it has "appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders".</p>

<p>Reading between the corporate speak lines, it's likely this refers to the Guillemots' and Tencent's ongoing conversations regarding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">potentially taking the company private</a>, among other options.</p>

<p>Those conversations are only likely to be growing more urgent thanks to the aforementioned underperformance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">recent cancellation of live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em></a>&nbsp;and the closure of two Ubisoft studios.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will now arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 20th (assuming it's not delayed again, of course).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New day, new Nintendo Switch 2 leaks. Nintendo is getting ever-closer to its April 2025 deadline to reveal its Switch successor, but thanks new renders <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">from OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em></a>, we may now have an even better idea of what the new console might look like.</p><p>If you’ve been following our coverage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaks</a>, these renders shouldn’t look too surprising. According to the new renders, the console will resemble the original Switch, but it will be bigger, with an 8.4-inch screen. Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p>The renders show that the top of the Switch 2 will feature a power button, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a game card slot, and, new for the Switch 2, a USB-C port. OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> also say that “there also seems to be a sensor of sorts” and they speculate that “this might be an ambient light sensor or something else.” These renders also have a U-shaped kickstand that has appeared in other leaks. </p><p>As for the Joy-Cons, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles’ </em>renders show the mysterious second new button on the right Joy-Con. However, they say the new button is <em>above</em> the Home button; other leaks have included the new button <em>below</em> it. The Joy-Cons in the renders have the large buttons in the back that are apparently used to detach the controllers from the console, which are apparently attached magnetically.</p><p>The renders also show an interesting color scheme for the Joy-Cons: they are mostly black but have color accents — light blue on the left one and orange on the right — under the joystick pads and on the bumped-out part of the controllers with the SL and SR buttons. A similar design popped up earlier this month for an alleged Switch 2 left Joy-Con <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336340/thats-a-nice-blue">with light blue accents</a>. I love it, personally.</p><p>Hopefully, given the tidal wave of recent leaks, we don’t have to wait too much longer for Nintendo to officially announce the new console. But whenever the console actually launches, it’s going to have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">some stiff competition</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has appointed a group of “leading advisors” to assist with exploring company options moving forward. The news comes as part of a special strategic update provided by the company on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” the company said via press release shortly before the call took place.</p>



<p>During the call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that this group of advisors will “review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.” He didn’t give details as to who these advisors are, but did say that things will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Guillemot says that he’s confident that this decision will “position Ubisoft for a stronger future” in the years to come, and that he’s confident there are “several potential paths” forward for the company.</p>







<p>As far as more information into what these paths are, Guillemot wouldn’t divulge. He was asked multiple times for more clarification, but said that he couldn’t say more and wouldn’t comment on “specific rumors” that were circulating. He reiterated, however, different options were being explored.</p>



<p>“We are limited in what we can say today,” he said while stating that the process has already been started with the advisors.</p>



<p>One of those potential paths is rumored to be a buyout by Chinese company Tencent. Guillemot was asked specifically about that possibility as well as the company being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to a “Chinese Military Blacklist”</a> by the United States government. Guillemot, once again, declined to comment on either front.</p>



<p>The update regarding the state of the company comes as Ubisoft announced another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Guilletmot said that the delay was part of the company’s “renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences”.</p>

The brief epilogue at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3 was a crossroads scene in itself, and though he doesn't reference Kingdom Hearts 4 directly, he said an explanation of this epilogue is "a story for another time."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura explained: "Crossroads act as an important point of divergence. To trace it right back, the motif was inspired by the well known crossroad myth from American folklore. The story goes like this: A young man makes a deal with the devil at a crossroads, trading his soul for the ability to play the guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first time a crossroads appears in Kingdom Hearts is in Chain of Memories, which is about losing something to gain something. And in fact, all subsequent appearances of crossroads have the same significance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The greatest example is Birth by Sleep, a story where all three protagonists pay a heavy price to obtain something. But wait... When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tiny, cryptic tease for Kingdom Hearts 4 is the most fans have had in years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event">Despite being revealed in September 2022 with a full cinematic trailer</a>, developer Square Enix has since gone incredibly quiet and, in series tradition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-fans-pine-for-update-on-2nd-anniversary-of-its-announcement">left fans pining for more information</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed flashy gameplay with protagonist Sora but Square Enix said this was from an Unreal Engine 4 demo, whereas <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-earts-4-gameplay-visuals-unreal-enigne-5">the actual game will be made in Unreal Engine 5</a>. It's already been analyzed completely too, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-may-tease-a-star-wars-section">some even think there's evidence of a Star Wars section</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, Nomura has said Kingdom Hearts 4 will, after 22 years and a whopping 18 games, finally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-22-years-and-18-games-kingdom-hearts-4-will-move-the-story-towards-its-end">shift the Kingdom Hearts narrative towards its conclusion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

        <p>And it's coming later this year.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's determined streak of announcing absolutely anything but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> continues today with the news its beloved Game Boy handheld is getting the Lego treatment later this year.
</p>
<p>
This is far from the first time Nintendo has partnered with Lego, of course; the companies have already released an extensive range of interactive Mario-themed sets, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree was also Lego-ised</a> last year. Nor is it the first time a Nintendo console has been immortalised in little plastic block form; a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-nes-leaks-online-costs-over-gbp200">Lego version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System</a> launched back in 2020 - and a lovely thing it was too.
</p>
<p>
And now it's the Game Boy's turn, as revealed in the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1877400377575792847">briefest of video teases</a> shared on Nintendo's social media channels. As the teaser unfolds, we see various Lego pieces glide in seductive soft-focus across the screen, but there's sadly no reveal of the full Lego build just yet.
</p> <div>

<p>
Not that it should be too hard to imagine. Fans have been creating their own Game Boys out of Lego for quite some time now, such as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTs5m4MGt4">delightful effort</a> from video editor and Lego Masters Australia finalist Nick Lever, which was shared online last year.
</p>
<p>
Should more details surface following today's Lego Game Boy tease, I'll update this story. But for now, all we know for sure is that it'll be arriving sometime this October.

		<p>Ubisoft has delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> once again, nudging the launch date back by around a month. The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows release date is 20th March 2025, the game coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Assassin’s Creed team, executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté said:</p>


<p><em>We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our incredible fans and dedicated teams for your unwavering support since our announcement in September to further refine and polish Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Accordingly, the new release date is</em> <strong><em>March 20, 2025</em></strong><em>. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams.</em></p>

<p><em>We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!</em></p>
<p>Previously planned for launch at the tail end of 2024, Ubisoft delayed AC Shadows to 14th February in the wake of a disappointing release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. “While the game is feature complete,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">Ubisoft said of AC Shadows in September last year</a>, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title.”</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<p>Grabbing an extra month for the final rounds of polish means that&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed Shadows is also avoiding going up directly against <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed</a>, both of which had shifted from their own late 2024 release plans – Avowed specifically trying to avoid other big game launches, and is now getting a bit lucky with that.</p>

Originally slated to launch on November 15, 2024, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered the first delay to February 14</a> as Ubisoft attempted to avoid the same fates of Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Now, the game has been pushed back to March 20, once again with the goal of providing a better game at launch.</p>
<p>With the same note, the publisher revealed that it had appointed advisors to review 'transformational strategic and capital options to create the best value for stakeholders.' Translating from investor speak, they will counsel the company on the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> potential sale options. This review process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ubisoft, stated:</p>
<p><em>We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future. We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, we are all behind our teams’ efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin’s Creed</em><br>
<em>opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to</em><br>
<em>Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months</em><br>
<em>that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong</em><br>
<em>note.</em></p>
<p>The importance of a successful launch for Assassin's Creed Shadows cannot be overstated. In today's report, Ubisoft also revealed that Q3 FY2024-25 net bookings will be lower than expected (at around €300 million) due to lower-than-anticipated Holiday sales, mainly for Star Wars Outlaws, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discontinuation of XDefiant</a>, planned for June.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft is continuing its cost-reduction process. The publisher now expects to exceed €200 million in reduction of its fixed cost base by FY2025-26 vs. FY2022-23 on an annualized basis. In December,&nbsp;three production studios in high-cost geographies were closed.</p>

            <p>The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.</p><!--more-->

<p>As the name suggests, Beyond Citadel is a sequel to The Citadel, which launched in 2020. It's the work of Japanese developer doekuramori, who I'm not familiar with. The premise: it is Armageddon O' Clock. You are the Martyr, gun-toting anime girl agent of seven guardian angels. Your task is to "cancel the apocalypse" by defeating the forces of the rapacious Trumpeters, and unearthing the buried secrets of humankind's final stronghold.</p>
<p>"Cancel the apocalypse" is seemingly a reference to Pacific Rim, but I have yet to meet Idris Elba in Beyond Citadel. His agent probably wouldn't let him anywhere near a hot potato like this. In any case, the more appropriate parallel here is surely Neon Genesis Evangelion, with its hyper-depressive Biblical imagery and penchant for grotesquely magnified bodily suffering.</p><p>Based on the Steam demo, the world is a mixture of rolling, external wastelands and square, multiple-elevation corridors and chambers where you'll play find-the-keycard, and also disembowel-the-demon. The gunplay is broadly Doom-to-Dark-Forces, but with corner-peeking and ironsight aiming. You also get options to make the handling more elaborate. You can turn on weapon deterioration, which might cause guns to jam, and there's a manual reload feature where you have to cock the firearm after feeding in shells. I love this latter system: it makes life harder, of course, but it creates a satisfying tempo and makes the combat feel more intricate and tactile. I like when video game guns go clicky-clack, perhaps even more than when they go boom.</p>
<p>I also like the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucah-born-of-a-dream">Lucah: Born Of A Dream</a> and its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a>. It's a universe of dense runes, gangrene-daubed monoliths, and hollow-eyed anime people slumped in attitudes of foreboding and despair. The menus and intermission screens consist of drawings of additional, hollow-eyed anime people, all of them huddled up gripping battleaxes and rifles while showing a lot of thigh.</p>
<p>There is plenty to read, with in-game writing that ranges from clipped computer logs to snippets of scripture. The English localisation is a bit scruffy, but it doesn't seem any more obscure than it intends to be. God is dead, I gather. "0-919 activation in process". Truth lies below.</p>

<p>I'm always keen on video games that involve a relentless descent through layers of mounting unearthliness, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>. In this case, looking down a shaft to the next area also means gazing directly into your character's pixelart cleavage. Which doesn't feel like an accident, on the developer's part. I suspect there's something more thoughtful to say about the relationship between the game's themes and its borderline-absurdist nudity and gore, perhaps touching on the ethereal, alien symbology of anime girls in general, but I'm not sure I'm the best writer for the job.</p>
<p>Still, I like Beyond Citadel's gunplay and spaces enough that I'll probably play a little more. I'll let you know if it proves worth the journey, but if you're convinced already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371240/Beyond_Citadel/">you can buy it on Steam right now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s release date brings with it bloodshed and battles. Warhorse Studio’s brand of historical warfare and realism has proven to be successful, so we’re here to take a look at Deliverance 2’s launch window and available platforms.</p>



<p>The first visit to Kingdom Come wasn’t overly loved by critics, but fans loved it. Its developer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance has sold 8 million copies</a> and counting. The 2018 RPG made its mark, and then some. Now, the eagerly awaited sequel is preparing to unsheath its blade and plunge it deep into any who have the gall to come back for a second helping.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest releases coming in early 2025</a>, and is set to wrap up the events of the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-s-release-date">When is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An epic war is coming. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is scheduled to launch on February 4</strong>.</p>



<p>It was announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-one-week-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deliverance 2 would be released a week earlier</a> than planned, and it’s set to expand on almost everything that made the original so popular.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has been hard at work on the sequel since the first game dropped. The studio has grown from 11 people to over 250, and Deliverance 2 is what the company wanted the original to be like—from the words of creative director Daniel Vávra in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R48DEEjyS5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s Official Game Reveal Trailer</a>.</p>



<p>There’s improved NPC behavior, better real-world interactions, an emphasis again on sleep and food, and new weapons are included such as crossbows and firearms.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-time">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is likely to be released at midnight worldwide</strong>—unless Warhorse Studios says otherwise.</p>



<p>Most games have a universal midnight release schedule for each region. Deliverance 2 doesn’t seem to be any different, so, for the time being, presume Delliverance 2 is releasing at midnight in your time zone. If you’re in New Zealand, you’re laughing, anywhere else, and you’re playing catch up!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-platforms">All Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s day-one launch platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor (for now), Deliverance 2 is restricted purely to next-gen consoles and formats. 2018’s first entry has versions on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Amazon Luna, and Nintendo Switch. The final format on this list was a newcomer—only debuting on Jun. 10, 2021—which means Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 could opt for extra platforms in the future as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ve already described the newest Kingdom Come as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG” in our preview</a>. Do you think it can live up to the original? Or is it going to be a King without a Kingdom?</p>



<p>Keep up to date with everything Deliverance 2 including its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC specs</a> and how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immersive</a> the sequel is shaping up to be. </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed yet again. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is being delayed from its February 14 release date to March 20.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté says that the game needs “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>“Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,” he said. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams. We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!”</p>







<p>On top of Côté’s statement, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a press release that the decision to delay the game again was “part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences.”</p>



<p>Côté also thanked the studio’s “incredible fans and dedicated teams” for their support after first delaying Shadows from November  2024 to February 2025 back in September. You can read his full statement below.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has said it is delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, as the company explores sale options.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated next Assassin's Creed game will now launch on 20th March. Previously the game was set to arrive on 14th February, after its initial delay from November 2024.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft said today that it was currently "taking decisive steps" to reshape the company and had now appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In plain English, it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Ubisoft is indeed investigating options for a sale</a>, as suggested by several reports late last year. In December, news agency Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft was discussing buyout options with Chinese giant Tencent, already a major shareholder, that would take the company private</a>.

<p>
Going forward, Ubisoft expects to it will "continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a
highly selective approach to investments". The suggestion seems to be of a continued narrowing of the company's focus, teams and output. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's statement notes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">recently-confirmed end of shooter XDefiant in December</a>, and the subsequent closure of three studios "in high-cost geographies". 
</p>
<p>"We learned a lot, of course, from this journey," Ubisoft said in a conference call this evening attended by Eurogamer, discussing the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>, "but we believe it was the difficult but right decision".</p>
<p>
In terms of investments, Ubisoft's statement points to the additional five weeks given to Assassin's Creed Shadows, whose developers will now have more time to incorporate additional changes.
</p>
<p>
"This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community," Ubisoft said. 
</p>
<p>During this evening's call, Ubisoft added that it would begin giving some players access to Shadows next week, though the suggestion here was this referred to limited hands-on oppurtunities granted to select individuals.</p>
<p>
Ubisoft additionally said it has suffered "lower than expected holiday sales, mainly for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" and had also lowered financial expectations due to the discontinuation of XDefiant.
</p>
<p>
"We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future," Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said in a statement. "We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximise value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises.
</p><p>
"Additionally, we are all behind our teams' efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin's Creed opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong note."
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a pivotal project for Ubisoft. It is the company's biggest blockbuster in development and its most-anticipated release since 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>. Its launch also heralds a new era for Assassin's Creed as a core focus for the company, with other projects of various shapes and sizes set to follow on an annual basis, all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">tied together via a new software hub</a>.</p>
<p>But its road to release has not been easy, something that recently prompted the franchise's boss Marc-Alexis Coté to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">issue an impassioned defence of the project and its many staff</a>. </p>
<p>"We only have one shot," Coté said of Ubisoft's decision to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows for the first time. "Ubisoft's portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality. "Players expect more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement from the games we release, and they're not shy about letting us know when they feel we have fallen short. This environment pushes us to do better and to be better.</p>
<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows represents our opportunity to change that narrative, not just for Assassin's Creed, but I think for Ubisoft as a whole."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
