            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered patch is now live for the PC version of the game, fixing select issues and bringing performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>Patch 1.1 focuses on introducing fixes that improve the experience, such as fixes for audio issues for pre-rendered cutscenes, which should now have the same volume as gameplay, a bug that causes disappearing or flickering shadows in Meridian when playing on ultrawide resolutions, HUD markers for objectives not rendering correctly with a custom FOV, Steam Input improvements and more. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2561580/view/4480612432780198115?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official patch notes</a> also mention various user interface, performance, and stability improvements, which, sadly, haven't been detailed in full, as well as the team working on future patches that will further improve the remaster.</p>
<p>Long considered a controversial remaster, given that the original is far from an old game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is a worthwhile upgrade of the PlayStation 4 release, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">greatly enhanced visuals and perfect performance</a> on both PlayStation 5 and PC. While the game doesn't look close in any way to its sequel, Forbidden West, the remaster's visual upgrades go a long way to competently close the gap between the two games.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-coming-to-early-access-november-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Dreamate and published by Fulqrum Publishing, New Arc Line is officially announced to be entering the Early Access period as of November 26, 2024. The game originally received a demo during <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a>, a period where a ton of demos are available, as well as games going on sale to showcase new and upcoming games. After receiving a lot of feedback during the demo period of New Arc Line, they have made the decision to opt into the Early Access period.</p>
<p>They've mentioned that they have opted to do this so that they can work closely with the fans to be able to make the full release of New Arc Line a smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone involved. To celebrate the release of New Arc Line being in Early Access, a trailer has been released on YouTube to showcase some of the content that you can expect from the upcoming title. It's only 37 seconds long but shows off some of the main features of the game, including dice rolls, combat, and the expansive SteamPunk world that you'll get to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As addressed in the announcement, the developers and publisher are aware that there will be players who are on edge about New Arc Line going into Early Access, especially as it's a story-driven game. However, in the announcement, it's been confirmed that the initial Early Access launch will "only contain about a quarter of the main storyline." Of course, as they continue development during the Early Access period, there are plans to add in more areas and quests to do, released across multiple content updates leading up to the full release. However, they plan to do it in a way that contributes more to the game's side quests and world-building content rather than giving away the main story too early on.</p>
<p>In addition, they will be using the Early Access period to focus on adding more classes, abilities, and companions that you can explore the world with, as well as making current mechanics in the game as balanced as possible so that when the full game is released, it releases with minimal issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking up New Arc Line while it's in the Early Access period, the game is currently at a significantly reduced price of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$19.99 on Steam</a>, which has been confirmed that they will be increasing later on when the game is more developed.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-gets-surprise-xbox-release-kojima-snaps-up-ip.1029801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has received a surprise Xbox release today, and the gaming legend has also announced that he and his studio Kojima Productions have acquired the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>is now available on Xbox Series X|S (although not on Xbox One), as well as the Microsoft Store and, uh, Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Kojima Productions says that this release is part of its strategy to "focus on bringing [its] award-winning IP&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>to more platforms and audiences", and as part of that mission, the studio also "now has full ownership" of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>as an IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=jlin_5jD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=bIpoE2iv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>is now available on Xbox Series X|S, in all its weird glory.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the version of <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>that's&nbsp;available on Xbox Series X|S now is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-is-coming-soon-to-playstation-5">the Director's Cut</a>, which means it includes a new location, new delivery items to help you out with your treks, and extra combat moves, plus lots more.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the base&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>game, of course, which remains the same profoundly odd and yet strangely compelling "walking simulator" it was when it first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-release-date-announced-along-with-new-trailer">launched on PS4 back in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, Kojima Productions is hard at work on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">once again star Norman Reedus</a> as protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, along with other returning stars like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on">Léa Seydoux</a> and Troy Baker.</p>

<p>Said sequel is currently set to launch next year for PS5, although now that Kojima has gained control of the <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>IP, it may very well come to other platforms in due course as well.</p>




<p>Filming for <i>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed">completed back in May</a>, so it looks like progress on the game continues apace. Let's hope it doesn't get delayed.</p>

<p>While you wait for that, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and now <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding/9nkchzztl308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> as well. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/death-stranding-review">our review of it here</a>, and I'd recommend doing so if you want a wild read.</p>

Starting today, a select number of users will have the ability to play around in their <em>NMS</em> universe across a collection of platforms with the new cross-save functionality. According to the announcement, adding cross-saving was a bit of an undertaking for the development team.</p><p>“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves,” <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">the announcement reads</a>. “Adding&nbsp;cross-save&nbsp;for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them.”</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> now supports cross-saves across PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Series S/X, Xbox Game Pass, PC, Steam Deck, PSVR 1 / 2, PCVR, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. Players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">visit this site</a> to link their different platform accounts and read the cross-save FAQ. However, only a select few players will be able to play their saves across different platforms with Hello Games rolling out the functionality to more players in the coming days.</p><p>November 7th is known in the BioWare fandom as N7 Day (get it, <strong>N</strong>ovember <strong>7</strong>th) — a semi-official community holiday celebrating all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship">Hello Games introduced <em>Mass Effect</em>’s famous starship</a>, the SSV Normandy SR-1 as a collectible ship. For this year’s N7 Day, the Normandy is back for players to claim for a limited time.</p><p>In addition to cross-saves and cool ships, to coincide with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the launch of the PS5 Pro</a>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is also getting an enhanced version compatible with the souped up console. Updated features include 4K resolution at 60fps, support for 8K resolution at 30fps, and improved lighting. </p><p>All three updates are available now and are completely free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile’s minimum requirements will be increased to iOS 17/Android 13 or higher from November 14, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1854249671994012087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Warzone Mobile’s minimum specifications require devices with iOS 17/Android 13 or higher on a device with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. If players wish to receive updates and access to the latest game version for Season 1 and beyond, they must meet those requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All is not lost for Warzone Mobile players who don’t meet the minimum requirements. The developers have provided 6 months for players to transition to a new device. Players with older iOS and Android versions can play “version 3.10 for a limited time (approximately six months),” provided they were already on ver 3.10 before November 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warzone Mobile developers have stated that the minimum requirements had to be updated for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise. They are currently working to bring new shared features such as Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1. </p>



<p>IPhone X and below do not support iOS 17; you will need an iPhone XS or higher to play the latest version of Warzone Mobile. For other queries, check out their <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-minimum-specifications-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty Mobile has reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-mobile-one-billion-downloads-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion downloads worldwide</a>.

<p>Shift Up has just confirmed that Stellar Blade can take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s processing power. For those running the game on Sony’s latest iteration of the PlayStation 5, two new graphics presets can be found in the settings: Pro and Pro Max. Both of these prests introduce HFR, but Pro Max causes a noticeable frame rate drop.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-photo-mode-when">Photo Mode When?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media platforms</a>, Shift Up posted a comparison video showcasing the difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro Stellar Blade gameplay. It takes something of a trained eye to truly spot the difference, but it’s there – somewhere.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406
</p></figure>







<p>Of course, in the comments under these posts, fans were quick to demand an ETA for photo mode, which was announced recently by Shift Up and is on the way. It doesn’t have a date for when it’s going to be added to the game, but it’s one of the most highly anticipated features that fans are holding out for.</p>



<p>It should have been present when the game was released, but who am I to judge?</p>



<p>The team also revealed recently that the game’s first major DLC is on the way. In September, the team at Shift Up announced a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover that will ‘bring post-apocalyptic universes colliding together’. </p>



<p>In April, when Stellar Blade was released, it topped the charts and shifted a million copies in just a few weeks, which isn’t bad for a new IP. It’s encouraging to see that Shift Up has plans to deliver more content, and this PR5 Pro Max upgrade is only the beginning.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has spoken about the importance in creating new franchises, or "new IP," in the industry parlance. During <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said nothing remains popular forever, so it's an essential business condition to always make new things instead of relying on sequels.</p><p>"We're different than a lot of other big companies. It's tempting for a big company to rest on its laurels," he said.</p><p>Take-Two would know a thing or two about having big franchises, as the company owns the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead franchises, both of which are enormously successful. Take-Two has referred to GTA and Red Dead as "permanent" franchises, meaning the company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-reason-to-believe-red-dead-redemption-2-is-happening/1100-6419966/" data-ref-id="1100-6419966">never stop making sequels.</a></p><p>At the same time, though, Zelnick said Take-Two needs to create new franchises or else it runs the risk of business deterioration.</p><p>"We know that if we put out a sequel, it's a lower-risk proposition than new intellectual property. But everything degrades. And even though most of our franchise sequels tend to do better than the prior release, and we're really proud of that because that's not standard for the industry," he said.</p><p>Zelnick added: "The truth is there is this thing called decay and entropy, and it's a feature of physics and human life and everything that exists on earth. And so ultimately, everything does decay, including hit titles. So if we're not trying new things and making new intellectual property, we're... to say that we're resting on our laurels really understates it. We're really running the risk of burning the furniture to heat the house, and that doesn't end well."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1328872117" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

continue to try new things, even if they don't succeed. Gearbox's MOBA Battleborn is an example of a new Take-Two property failing to find an audience; the same can be said for Evolve. Beyond the console/PC space, Zelnick said Take-Two is trying new things on mobile and has found some success with games like Match Factory and Toon Blast.</p><p>Trying new things means that "the risk profile is higher," and Take-Two will sometimes slip up and take a hit financially. "But in the fullness of time, it's one of the key ways to create durable value," he said of new IP.</p><p>Looking ahead, Take-Two has a number of new IP in the works, including the multiplayer game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-ethos/" data-ref-id="5000-647673"> Project Ethos</a>. Zelnick said on the call that he "couldn't be more proud" of the team at 31st Union and the game itself. 31st Union held an open test for the game earlier this year, and Zelnick said the team has been "enthused" about the feedback. "So we're off to a great start, and there's more to come," he said.</p><p>Another new IP coming from Take-Two is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, the next game from BioShock designer Ken Levine.</p><p>Take-Two's biggest upcoming game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which launches in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The company also has Borderlands 4 coming up from Gearbox in 2025. These games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">won't be released close together</a>, which suggests Borderlands 4 is coming earlier in 2025.</p>

            <p>
It barely seems like yesterday I was writing it barely seems like yesterday since we last had a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> update, but here I am doing it again as Hello Games' exploratory space sim ushers in cross-save support, PS5 Pro enhancements, and even the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via No Man's Sky's latest update (the sixth this year, if you're counting, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's The Cursed update</a>), which begins with a feature "years" in the making: cross-save. Starting today, cross-save is available alongside cross-play for all platforms - including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Steam Deck, PSVR VR 1 &amp; 2, and PC VR - meaning players can pick up from where they left off regardless of which machines they're hopping between.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games says introducing the feature has been "especially difficult" given the range of platforms its catering for and the age of saves some players are still using. "It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of... incredibly detailed saves," it explains. "Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there, the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!"
</p>
<p>
As such, Hello Games is taking a cautious approach to cross-save and rolling out the feature gradually. Starting today, all players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">link their various platform accounts together via the No Man's Sky website</a>, and a "subset of players" will be able to access cross-saves initially. "In the coming weeks," the studio adds, "all players will be invited to do so."
</p><p>
But there's more; to coincide with today's PlayStation Pro launch, Hello Games is releasing an enhanced version of No Man's Sky for the platform, introducing "crisp 4K resolution at 60fps" and 8K at 30fps. That's alongside improved lighting, plus ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion across all modes. These enhancements are also available on PSVR2.
</p>
<p>
And finally for today's No Man's Sky update, Hello Games is joining in with BioWare's annual Mass Effect N7 celebrations by running an "overhauled" version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-unlock-mass-effects-normandy-sr1-as-a-frigate-in-no-mans-sky-for-a-limited-time">2021's limited-time Beachhead expedition</a>. Completing this quest unlocks Mass Effect's SSV Normandy SR1 as a useable frigate in-game, with players having two weeks to acquire it starting today.
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for No Man's Sky, we've yet to hear more about the Worlds Part 2 release Hello Games teased alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive Worlds Part 1 update</a> back in July, but that one seems to have slipped so it's unclear if we'll see more of it this year. And, of course, we're coming up to 12 months <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">since the reveal of the studio's next game</a>, Light No Fire, so perhaps we'll learn more about that come December's Game Awards.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-sells-indie-label-private-division-to-undisclosed-buyer.1029750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has sold off its indie label Private Division to an unknown buyer, citing a need to "focus [its] resources on growing [its] core and mobile businesses for the long-term".</p>

<p>In a set of <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prepared remarks</a> accompanying Take-Two's latest financial results, company president Karl Slatoff says that the transaction involved the mystery buyer "purchas[ing Take-Two's] rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles".</p>

<p>It looks like Early Access action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em>, which was released back in April,&nbsp;wasn't included in that transaction, though, because Slatoff says that Take-Two "will continue to support" the game. He concludes by thanking Private Division for its "contributions" to Take-Two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=WqMTJJ-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=C1c891Eh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division has been sold, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>hasn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Private Division's fate has been uncertain for some time. When Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> back in April, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> noted that many of the workers who would lose their jobs as part of that layoff wave were Private Division employees.</p>

<p>Later, in May, evidence began to pile up that Take-Two had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">shuttered the developers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome</em>, both of which were games published by Private Division. Take-Two itself, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied shutting down those studios</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that same month,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team revealed that its partnership with Private Division for an upcoming new horror IP <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership">had ended</a>, with Take-Two being the entity that terminated said partnership.</p>

<p>That game may well be new horror project&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, which will now be self-published by Bloober Team. It's circumstantial, of course, but this could be more evidence that Private Division was in the process of being sold even then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=O8GpP_LW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=QA7WCtgc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Private Division's name from<em>&nbsp;Kerbal Space Program</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Private Division's sale comes as part of Take-Two's Q2 financial report, in which the company announces that net bookings have risen by 6% overall compared to last year.</p>

<p>According to Take-Two, this financial performance was mainly driven by "strength in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>franchises", and that's without the release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">due to arrive next year</a>.</p>

<p>You can see the rest of Take-Two's <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/ff9f9b55-43a5-4af5-ab54-13a77102d4b9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you're interested in the nerdy stats side of things. We don't yet know to whom Private Division was sold, but it's possible we'll find out in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, the rumour took root that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s release date would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">slip back from 2025 to 2026</a>. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">a full return to in-office work</a>. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">a fall 2025 launch in March</a> and have just doubled down on it in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">their latest financial briefing</a>, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked how Take-Two work out a game's release timing by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html">CNBC</a>, Zelnick commented that "there are elements that you can actually measure, for example the number of bugs in a title, and every one of us will make sure we have as few bugs as possible before we launch.</p>
<p>"However, in the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs," he went on. "It's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p>
<p>CNBC were not appeased by these scintillating philosophical <em>bon mots</em>. They pressed ahead, asking Zelnick how confident he was in the fall 2025 timing, given that it wasn't so long ago that Take-Two had GTA 6 pinned for 2025 at large.</p>
<p>"Well, there is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Zelnick replied. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p>
<p>Here's another GTA 6 release snippet by way of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/">Variety</a>, who had their own interview with Zelnick. In this latter chinwag, Zelnick commented that the game won't release at the same time as Borderlands 4, due between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026, because "it's safe to say that we wouldn't, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily." I think it's also safe to say that if it came to a conflict over launch windows, Borderlands 4 would be the one to make room.</p><p>The fall 2025 release only covers the game's console showing, of course. Take-Two have yet to spill the beans about the GTA 6 PC release date, but Zelnick did say in an earnings call last night that they're feeling pretty good about PC support in general.</p>
<p>"The audience is going to show up if you have great properties, so we just have to make sure to be on an array of platforms," he said, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-publisher-says-it-isnt-complicated-for-us-to-support-pc-and-great-cool-so-wheres-that-gta-6-pc-announcement/">Gamesradar</a>. "If one platform diminishes in value, there's always another one.</p>
<p>"We're seeing great growth in PC right now, for example. I have been of the view that open formats would continue to grow and PC is an open format. I do think PC will continue to be a more and more important part of the console business going forward, and that isn't complicated for us to support at all. So the bottom line is, we are selective about which platforms we support. We make the tech work when we can make it work, as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile."</p>

<p>If I had been present during that CNBC interview, I would have asked Zelnick what he thinks of the fact that GTA 5 players are obsessively trying to predict the next GTA 6 marketing beat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-fans-desperate-for-an-october-reveal-are-convinced-rockstar-are-trolling-them">based on the phases of the moon</a>. This has blown up again on reddit lately because somebody's realised that the Tom Petty song from the GTA 6 trailer, above, has the words "wait for the moon" in it.</p><p>I would have asked about this in the few seconds before somebody spotted the rando Britisher lurking behind the green screen and phoned security. "TELL ME ABOUT THE MOON, STRAUSS," I would have bellowed, as huge men in tuxedos dragged me away into an unmarked van.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two has two big releases coming up next year, GTA 6 and Borderlands 4, and the CEO has just confirmed that both titles will not be released close to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that they would not release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 in the same period, even though they have similar release windows. When asked about this, Zelnick stated, “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>, as confirmed during the latest earnings call, and Borderlands 4 has been announced for fiscal year 2026, which falls between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. It is hard to figure out Take-Two’s release plans for both titles, but they could reserve 2025 for GTA 6 and let Borderlands 4 find its glory in 2026.&nbsp;We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>



<p>In the same interview, Zelnick also acknowledged the Borderlands movie’s disappointing run; however, he added that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it helped sell more video games within the franchise</a>. Zelnick stated that they are still looking forward to more adaptations of their intellectual properties and have selectively licensed some of them. Currently, they have a deal pending on the ‘Bioshock’ adaptation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption series has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-series-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 92 million units</a>. Also, a new PGA Tour 2K title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2025</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-weapon-customization-lets-you-add-a-shotgun-to-a-sniper-rifle.1029732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since the days of Army of Two, I’ve been a fan of weapon customization in video games. It’s satisfying to take a standard rifle or submachine gun, modify it to your liking, and make it a memorable weapon that remains with you throughout the story. In Stalker 2, weapon customization proves extensive, and you have many unique options—pistols, SMGs, sniper rifles, and even light machine guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-weapon-customization-like-in-stalker-2">What’s Weapon Customization Like in Stalker 2?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a recent gameplay trailer, ‘Smoking Barrels,’ we now better understand the weapon customization mechanics in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It appears GSC Game World borrowed plenty from past titles, including the weapon upgrade menu and mechanic, which is genuinely nice to see return. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch above in its entirety, showcases several unique weapons found across the Zone, along with customization, upgrade mechanics, and even jam and maintenance gameplay. According to the studio, we must account for our weapon’s cleanliness, ballistics, physics, and even the ammunition type we bring to each encounter.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-stalker-2-weapons-that-we-know-so-far">All Stalker 2 Weapons That We Know So Far</h2>



<p>In all, there are 35 weapons in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, ranging from early-game handguns to late-game machine guns and launchers. You’ll likely wind up with a favorite. I have my eye on the OTs-02 Kiparis for close-range encounters and the AS VAL for everything else, but I know many will opt for the HK416 for its modularity and accuracy.</p>

With a complete community simulation of every character acting on their free will, you can experience unexpected events to feel the various emotions life has to offer.

Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game’s realistic graphics allows the players to let their imagination run free, with easy creation of different resources. Customize your character’s appearance and outfit and build your custom home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures. You can also adjust different parts of your property and surrounding roads as well as aspects of your residing city for a fully customizable experience.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here is a message from producer and director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim posted to the game’s official Discord server today:</p><blockquote><p>To <em>inZOI</em> fans around the world,</p><p>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our fans. Your immense love and unwavering support mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom. Seeing everyone create such unique Zois during our <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> demo period was truly inspiring.</p><p>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing “Canvas” to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an incredible amount of uploads. Seeing such engagement brought us so much happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with <em>inZOI</em>. Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</p><p>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release <em>inZOI</em> in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving <em>inZOI</em> the best possible start.</p><p>It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with <em>inZOI</em>—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving <em>inZOI</em> a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible.</p><p>Until the release date, we’ll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come. We’ll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you’ll continue to join us on this journey towards <em>inZOI</em>‘s Early Access and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>With love,<br>Kjun</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/inZOI-EA_11-07-24_Art.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Hello Games has released a long-awaited feature for No Man's Sky: cross-save. The small developer said it was a huge undertaking, but it was one of the most requested features from the community.</p>
<p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server was particularly challenging for No Man's Sky, as the workload increases with each platform supported and the length of time people have been playing. Hello Games found that many players had accumulated thousands of hours in their saves, which inevitably made it more complicated for them to implement this feature. For these reasons, they have slowly worked on the technology needed for the cross-save update for over six months.</p>
<p>The rollout begins now with a small number of players. Starting today, all No Man's Sky players can link their different accounts <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. A subset of players will then be able to select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. Over the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Cross-Save Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBlz6kcdAS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thanks to cross-save, players can play on their console from the comfort of their sofa, continue one of the game's Expeditions on the move with the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their powerful PC rig, and then view it in incredibly immersive virtual reality. No Man's Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save across the following platforms: PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2 and PC VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Mass Effect Normandy Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9tWSdd1hD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That's not all, as today's update marks the return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-comes-to-no-mans-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with BioWare's Mass Effect franchise</a> on N7 Day. Starting today and for the next two weeks, No Man's Sky players are getting another chance to meet the SSV Normandy SR1 in a reworked version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1207578601008926791/1303969784550920273" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message on the game's official Discord server</a>, director Hyungjun Kim, also known as "Kjun", announces that the&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>release date is March 28th. He then apologizes that the team wasn't able to "bring you the game sooner", but that the delay is necessary to give&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>"the best possible start".</p>

<p>Kjun goes on to say that the response to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">its character creator test</a>, as well as its trial of user-generated content platform Canvas, was "amazing", and that seeing "such engagement" led the team to realize the responsibility it has to "provide players with the most complete experience possible".</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will be one of a rapidly-dwindling handful of competitors to EA's titanic&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, which essentially currently stands unopposed in its niche (and which isn't going to be getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">a new numbered mainline entry</a> any time soon).</p>

<p>Paradox was working on a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>&nbsp;competitor by the name of&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>, but the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled back in June</a>, causing the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled">profits to nosedive</a>&nbsp;as a result.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other major rival to&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>that's currently in development is&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>, which is currently scheduled for an Early Access release sometime next year as well (assuming it doesn't get delayed, of course).</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is due to land on PC via Steam Early Access on March 28th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

The existing Priority membership is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-performance-membership">being renamed to Performance</a>, with 1440p streaming, ultrawide resolution support, and the ability to save graphics settings across streaming sessions. Nvidia is also introducing a 100-hour monthly playtime cap for new Performance or Ultimate GeForce Now members starting on January 1st, 2025.</p><p>New GeForce Now members that sign up for the service from 2025 onward will have a cap on monthly playtime set at 100 hours. That works out to around three hours of usage every day of the month, and Nvidia says it’s putting the cap in place to avoid increasing membership prices “in the foreseeable future.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The GeForce Now membership options.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“This allows GeForce Now to continue to provide unparalleled quality and speed — as well as short to no queue times&nbsp;— for all paid members, without increasing membership fees,” says Nvidia in a blog post. “This change will affect less than 6 percent of members.”</p><p>While this cap will only initially impact new GeForce Now members, all active paid subscribers as of the end of this year will still lose their unlimited playtime on January 1st, 2026.

GeForce Now subscribers will be able to purchase 15 hours of extra playtime, with the Performance 15-hour blocks priced at $2.99 and the Ultimate 15-hour playtime priced at $5.99.</p><p>Nvidia is also offering a 25 percent discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes until November 22nd, which you can then upgrade to a monthly or six-month recurring membership to lock in a full year of unlimited playtime ahead of the 100-hour playtime caps for existing members in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Life simulator inZOI is heading to Early Access. In a message on the game’s Discord server on Thursday, director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim announced that inZOI Early Access will launch on March 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The new date <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moves the game</a> out of the original late-2024 Early Access timeline. </p>



<p>Kim started his message by thanking players for taking part in the Character Studio demo over the summer, and saying that the reception was more than he or the team could’ve expected. </p>



<p>“Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI,” he said. </p>



<p>When the Character Studio was available, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19,000 concurrent players</a> created over 100,000 characters. With that response and feedback, it gave Kim and the studio the insight needed to provide players with “the most complete experience possible”.</p>



<p>“It’s said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings,” Kim said. “The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. </p>



<p>“This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.”</p>



<p>Kim closed by saying the team’s goal is to “deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come”.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming sat down with Kim&nbsp;to talk about inZOI about the game’s development, his goals, and more. Stay tuned for that in the near future.</p>

<p>You’ll play whatever is brand-new, launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 whenever the system finally releases, right? But what about past titles? I don’t know about you, but I have zero intention of tossing aside my old system or games, so I’d like to get additional playtime from them, even with a new console generation in hand. So, here are a few games you should play first on Nintendo Switch 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible">Is The Nintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatible?</h2>



<p>Following official confirmation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 offers backward compatibility</a> for Nintendo Switch titles, I thought it would be fun to look at a few of the top games of the current generation. They’ll surely carry forward, with fun gameplay and adequate graphics, even though competition will be stiff with an entirely new series of launch games.</p>



<p>Here’s what Nintendo’s Furukawa said about the upcoming system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Furukawa. At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-backwards-compatible-games-should-you-play-on-nintendo-switch-2">What Backwards Compatible Games Should You Play on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Since the idea here is to ensure all Nintendo Switch titles work on the Nintendo Switch 2, on day one, we’ll have a massive library of games to choose from, along with anything new coming out for the successor system. But instead of speculating about what’s to come, let’s look back toward the top games on the Nintendo Switch that you’ll want to play on Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>



<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Octopath Traveler 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Honestly? We could continue listing exceptional Nintendo Switch titles until the list hits the triple digits. But for now, these ten titles prove time-consuming and extraordinary in their own ways.</p>



<p>If you have any suggestions for exciting Nintendo Switch games anyone should check out on Nintendo Switch 2, let us know in the comments below. You can also visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to discuss the Nintendo Switch 2 with hyped-up fans!</p>



<hr>



<p>Of course, the list of Nintendo Switch games continuously grows with each passing month. Not long ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-arrives-for-nintendo-switch-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we received Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team</a>!</p>
