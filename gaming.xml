		<p>After months and months of rumours and speculation, Sony has finally taken the wraps off the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, a mid-generation spec bump that aims to banish the choice between Fidelity mode and Performance modes. Here’s what we now know about the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Console - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HaRMiTfvks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>PS5 Pro release date, price &amp; pre-orders</h2>
<p>One of the main things to know about the PS5 Pro is when it’s coming out and how much it will cost. The launch date for the PS5 Pro is set for 7th November 2024. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>


<p>As for the cost, I hope you’ve been saving up, because it will set you back $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000.</p>
<p>Note that this is a disc-less console at that price, with support for the optional UHD drive add-on debuted alongside the PS5 Slim. It’s also a horizontal console unless you fork out for a vertical stand.</p>

<h3>A partial PS5 Pro spec sheet</h3>
<p>Mark Cerny did not provide a full spec sheet, but this is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/ps5-reveal-list-games-playstation-5-date-specs-everything/">an extension of the base PS5</a>. In other words, it will still have the same 8 core Zen 2 CPU (potentially clocked a little bit higher), 16GB of RAM, us the Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, allow you to slot in an extra NVMe drive, and more. The console is roughly the same height as the original PS5, with the width of the PS5 Slim.</p>

<p>Here’s where it’s improved and upgraded:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>GPU</strong></td>
<td>60 Compute Units – 67% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>AI Upscaling</strong></td>
<td>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Memory</strong></td>
<td>16 GB GDDR6 at 573GB/s – 28% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Internal Storage</strong></td>
<td>2TB built-in NVMe SSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Optical Drive</strong></td>
<td>Optional Ultra HD Blu-ray (sold separately)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Video Output</strong></td>
<td>Up to 4K at 120Hz, 8K, VRR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Wireless Network</strong></td>
<td>Wi-Fi 7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 67% increase in GPU compute units, fed by a 28% increase in RAM speed allows for roughly 45% increase in GPU performance. However, there’s much more to it than that.</p>
<p>The enhanced GPU also comes alongside improved ray-tracing that can offer 2-3x the performance of the base PS5. It’s not clear if this is entirely down to the GPU, or if it’s going hand-in-hand with the PSSR processor. Still, that’s quite an impressive bump.</p>
<p>But what does this all mean for your gaming?</p>
<h3>Graphical improvements with PS5 Pro</h3>
<p>Developers will be able to use all of this power in a number of ways. Mark Cerny stated that Sony’s goal was to effectively remove the need for graphics modes, so numerous games will be upgraded to provide Fidelity Mode graphics at Performance Mode frame rates – examples included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5/">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a>.</p>
<p>Already performant games can alternatively push enhanced visual effects into the games. Gran Turismo 7, for example, will now be able to render ray-traced reflections during races, when these were previously limited to replays. This will likely be the new Fidelity vs. Performance mode toggle.</p>
<h2>PS5 Pro game upgrades</h2>
<p>The games already confirmed to have native PS5 Pro enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5-ps4/">Horizon Forbidden West</a></li>
<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, enhanced games will be marked with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label.</p>
<h3>PS5 Pro backward compatibility enhancements</h3>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancements are not limited to games with native support and updates. The console is fully compatible to the library of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games available on standard PS5, and you can leverage it in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Pro Game Boost</strong> – this can be applied across all PS4 and PS5 games, using the GPU power to stabilise or improve performance of games, similar to the PS4 Pro Game Boost feature back in the day. With many games featuring dynamic resolution and now variable refresh rate modes, this will be a great de facto upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Image Quality </strong>– Available for “select PS4 games”, the PS5 Pro will seemingly be able to use PSSR to upscale the PS4 image to higher resolutions. This will be most useful for early generation PS4 games, which were not enhanced for PS4 Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly there doesn’t seem to be an effort to do Xbox-style game injection, which would have potentially been able to replace FSR and FSR 2 upscaling with PSSR, but it’s possible that this could be added in a firmware update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-the-dark-horizon-is-the-third-and-final-dlc-out-on-september-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Gunfire Games and Arc Games announced the release date for Remnant II: The Dark Horizon, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-gets-third-dlc-delay-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final DLC</a> scheduled for Remnant II: September 24.</p>
<p>In The Dark Horizon, players will return to N'Erud and discover a mysterious place preserved in time, where alien farmlands are tended by robots for long-dead inhabitants. But time corrupts everything, and rogue AI and robotic creations are now threats to travelers searching for the secrets of a colossal being that dominates the skyline. Players will uncover the secrets within the necropolis world of N'Erud. Moreover, as they enter this new overworld, they'll find new dungeons, experience a new glider traversal system not found elsewhere, acquire a new archetype, The Warden, meet unexpected allies, and face new threats.</p>
<p>The glider traversal system lets players choose which parts of the overworld they want to explore, including how to face the new world boss. As for The Warden, the new archetype uses a fully automated Drone that can shield, heal, or even attack enemies, making it the perfect partner on the battlefield. Remnant II: The Dark Horizon will also add many items and powerful weapons, including new items such as amulets and rings. When it comes to boss fights, fans can expect mysterious threats and survivors of unknown origin to emerge from the long-extinct civilization, with rogue AI and robotic creations lurking around every corner, posing new challenges for all players.</p>

<p>Beyond the Dark Horizon, Remnant II will also get a free update on the same day. The highlight of the patch is undoubtedly the new Boss Rush game mode. As suggested by the name, Boss Rush lets players get right into the action with bosses. The mode is playable either solo or with fellow travelers via multiplayer, and players may choose from three difficulty levels - Triple Threat (a three-boss run), Trial by Fire (a seven-boss run), and The Gauntlet (a nineteen-boss run).</p>
<p>The mode's goal is simple yet extremely challenging: successfully battle hordes of enemies, including an Aberration, to face bosses and earn drops. Along the way, players will earn temporary buffs during the run that grant stat bonuses and/or powerful passive bonuses that will prove helpful. To access Boss Russ, they can go to the World Stone in Station 13 and select the mode, similar to selecting Campaign or Adventure).</p>

<p>In addition to the new game mode, the free Remnant II content update will also introduce a new system called Prisms. Prisms are a new feature of the rebalanced fragment system and can be leveled up to grant additional stat bonuses.</p>

            <p>Grand duchess of first-person factory sims Satisfactory has finally hit 1.0 on PC after five years in early access, introducing a "full narrative overhaul" together with some new alien technology which you can witness and boggle at via the 1.0 launch trailer, below. They've also announced a console version, but we don't care for such things. The only Satisfactory console I care about is the one that lets you deactivate the fog so you can obtain an unmurky view of your glittering conveyor belt empire.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you're new to Satisfactory, it's about turning a perfectly blameless alien planet into a gleaming and grinding network of production lines. You're a "Pioneer" working on behalf of the illustrious FICSIT Inc, who need you to extract and process any resources worth noting and send it up the Space Elevator for the purposes of the Save The Day program. It's possible that FICSIT Inc aren't quite what they're cracked up to be, but hush now -  you're here to ensure a steady flow of matter into the refinery, not think about "worrying undertones". Or even "worrying overtones" - Satisfactory's satire of space capitalism isn't exactly subtle.</p>
<p>‌Back in 2020, Rock Paper Shotgun's own far-future Dickensian habitat despoiler Brendan Caldwell deemed Satisfactory a ruddy good time. And also, a relatively laidback one given a sufficient quantity of spare leisure hours. "Everything can be twiddled and tweaked to make an assembly line run with utmost efficiency, or even slowed down to half speed, to make output steadier and avoid clogged conveyor belts," he wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-review-early-access">Satisfactory early access review</a>. "But the opposite is also true. You can, like me, play the whole thing by ear. Make a shitty factory. It's fine. You're the only human on the planet, no one is going to fire you." It's just as well, Brendy, because that "needless, kilometre-long pipeline" sounds like it might have earned you a few weeks' suspension without pay. </p>
<p>Satisfactory has come a ways since Brendy stunk up the early access build with his excess plumbing. The 1.0 version adds various technologies, including endgame Portals "for near-instantaneous transportation across the vast alien lands", though this requires "huge power capacity" and access to Singularity Cells. Dimensional Depots, meanwhile, "offer an efficient option for inventory management" powered by Strange Alien Matter. I am guessing they let you store things in alternate dimensions. You also have more power to customise your uniform, with a range of colours, helmets, tool trinkets and skins. Nothing like a powerdrill pendant to keep your mind on the job and not on why you're reducing an Edenic paradise to a maze of smokestacks.</p>
<p>We have written many a thing about Satisfactory over the years - here's Alex Wiltshire (RPS in Minecraft) recounting how developers Coffee Stain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-satisfactorys-developer-tricked-their-audience-and-why-their-audience-loved-it">lied about pipes</a>, and here's Brendy again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cars-in-videogames">praising the golfcart</a>. Personally, I've only ever sunk a piffling 10 hours into the early access build. I engineered some kind of logjam involving smelters and couldn't be arsed to fix it. This is my cue to start afresh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony today announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation hardware upgrade that will play the same game library as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">2020's PlayStation 5</a>, but with higher frame rates and better resolution than on the original system. The new units will be available on Nov. 7 for a price of $699.99, Sony said.</p>
<p>The updated hardware will come complete with 2TB of solid state storage (up from 1TB on the original PS5), but without an Ultra HD Blu-Ray disc drive, which will only be available as an optional accessory sold separately, Sony said <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910040977/en/">in a press release</a>.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HaRMiTfvks?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">a video presentation Tuesday</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny said PS5 developers "desire more graphics performance" in order to deliver the visuals they want at a frame rate of 60 fps. The lack of enough graphical power on the PS5 leads to a difficult decision for players between the higher resolution of "fidelity" mode and the smoother frame rates of "performance" mode (with three-quarters of players choosing the latter, according to Cerny).</p>
<p>The goal of the PS5 Pro, Cerny says, is delivering "the graphics that the game creators aspire to, at the high frame rates players typically prefer." To do this, the new system will sport a larger GPU that can support "up to 45% faster rendering," Cerny said, with 67 percent more compute units and 28 percent faster video RAM than the PS5. This will allow for "almost fidelity-like graphics at 'performance' frame rates" of 60 frames per second in many existing PS5 games, Cerny said.</p>

                    The two sides of this comparison are supposed to look comparable in fidelity, but the PS5 Pro is running at 60 fps, as opposed to 30 fps on the PS5.                  </p>

<p>The PS5 Pro will also bring what Cerny says is a "streamlined and accelerated approach" to ray-tracing, with individual rays calculated at "double or even triple the speeds of PlayStation 5." In examples shown on video, Cerny highlighted how reflections between cars are now available at 60 fps for <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> on the PS5 Pro, and how games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> could have more realistic shadow effects.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>An "AI library" called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) will be available on the PS5 Pro to automatically upscale in-game scenes as well. Cerny highlighted how this can make distant crowds in a game like <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to look much clearer.</p>
<p>Titles that can take advantage of the PS5 Pro's more powerful GPU will be marketed as "PS5 Pro Enhanced." Titles that will sport that designation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alan Wake 2</em></li>
<li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li>
<li><em>Demon’s Souls</em></li>
<li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></li>
<li><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></li>
<li><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></li>
<li><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></li>
<li><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></li>
<li><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></li>
<li><em>The Crew Motorfest</em></li>
<li><em>The First Descendant</em></li>
<li><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Other titles will be able to take advantage of "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which Sony says "may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games."</p>
<h2>PS5.5</h2>
<p>The upgrade follows on the history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">the PS4 Pro</a>, which launched almost exactly three years after the PS4 and offered the capacity for higher resolutions, faster frame rates, or both in many PS4 library games. The PS5 Pro comes farther into the lifecycle for Sony's latest console, though, and at a point where Sony has yet to lower <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/is-the-us-market-ready-to-embrace-a-500-game-console/">the $500 launch price</a> for the console, and actually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">increased the price of the disc-drive-free Digital Edition</a> last year (though inflation has taken some of the sting out of that nominal pricing).</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro comes after last year's launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/ps5-slim-teardowns-suggest-same-chip-not-much-shrinking-but-nifty-disc-drive/">a redesigned PS5 "Slim" model</a>, which reduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-playstation-5-looks-to-be-the-biggest-game-console-ever-made/">the original PS5's famously massive bulk</a> while keeping the internal processing power the same while</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to show any sign of plans for a similar power level update for the Xbox Series X/S, which also launched in late 2020. Earlier this year, though, Microsoft did announce <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/microsoft-reveals-first-disc-less-xbox-series-x/">the first disc-drive-free edition of the Xbox Series X</a> for this holiday season.</p>
<p>Nintendo, which launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">a Switch with an improved OLED screen in 2021,</a> is widely expected to launch a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">backward compatible</a> follow-up to the Switch <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">in 2025</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Michael Myers was previously introduced into Call of Duty: Ghosts as a playable character who was a reward for completing a challenge on the Fog DLC map. This time the horror icon looks to be returning as an operator bundle. Other Halloween-themed operators are teased for this year's The Haunting, including the scarecrow from Trick 'R Treat and the clown from the Terrifier movies. The trailer also showcases a demonic, three-headed operator skin for Ghost, and Makarov has a terrifying grin that looks very much related to the Smile movie.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on Season 6 should be revealed in the coming days. The new season of Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone should bring the usual offerings of a brand-new battle pass, more seasonal challenges, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Activision has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms/1100-6526378/">Black Ops 6 will not have a campaign early-access period</a>.

		<p>With today’s PS5 Technical Presentation, Sony’s console Lead Architect Mark Cerny has revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro, detailing the enhanced and more powerful mid-generation upgrade to the PS5.</p>
<p>The presentation also confirms that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will launch on 7th November 2024, costing $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000. A disc drive is not included, but is an optional £100 add-on. A vertical stand is also an add-on at £25. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Technical Presentation hosted by Mark Cerny" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X24BzyzQQ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 Pro improves on the base PS5 in every measure. There is a bump in CPU performance, faster RAM, and a big boost to GPU performance up to 45% faster thanks to being 1.6 times the size, which should bring the 4K60 dreams that most gamers seem to have a bit closer to reality. The new generation of GPU will also bring enhanced ray tracing capabilities.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;native 4K is still going to be pretty unlikely – that’s just no how games work anymore – and so Sony has also developed a custom in-house upscaling technique called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling). This aims to be best in class, going up against DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS and other temporal upscaling techniques.</p>

<p>The intention is to remove the decision between Fidelity and Performance modes. The examples used were of The Last of Us Part 2, Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart, giving Fidelity Mode graphics but at double the performance with 60FPS.</p>
<p>Advanced Ray Tracing will allow Gran Turismo 7 to bring ray tracing live in the races, as opposed to locking them to replays. Third party developers are also getting in on the act, with Hogwarts Legacy bringing greater reflections into the world.</p>
<p>Games enhanced for the new console will get a ‘PS5 Pro Enhanced’ label, while support is being added to:</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, The Crew Motorfest, The First Descendant, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>
<p>Even without native support, PS5 Pro Game Boost will be able to improve performance across the full range of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to apply PSSR to the older games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-5-update-available-now-adding-three-new-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-0-adds-penacony-realm-on-february-6/">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is now available for players to dive into, where they will finally be able to uncover the secrets of the Shackling Prison, experience the Wardance ceremony, and be introduced to powerful adversaries. Honkai: Star Rail version 2.5 also introduces three new characters for players to learn about. These characters are Feixiao, Lingsha and Moze, adding a new level of excitement to the game. For those who played Honkai: Star Rail 2.4, players were left on an intense cliffhanger, which will now be resolved in version 2.5, where players can continue the main questline and see more of the Xianzhou Luofu arc.</p>
<p>Version 2.5 of Honkai: Star Rail adds a lot to the game, especially with players finally getting to reach the climax of the silkpunk saga taking place in the Shackling Prison. A special Warp Event will take place to celebrate the first half of version 2.5, where players can pull for Robin, Black Swan, and Kafka. The Warp count for the guaranteed 5-star will be shared across rerun and current limited banners.</p>
<p>For those who want to get stuck into the Honkai: Star Rail 2.5 update, the update is already out across the globe. The update lasted five hours, but Honkai: Star Rail maintenance typically ends after four hours. Players get 300 Stellar Jade as compensation to make up for the downtime.</p>
<p>The official Honkai: Star Rail YouTube channel has also released a trailer that is just over two minutes long to showcase some of the storylines and characters players can expect to see in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Version 2.5 Trailer — &quot;Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue&quot; | Honkai: Star Rail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMHigW8mq9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are three new storylines, one of which is the continuation of Xianzhou Luofu- Finest Duel Under the Pristine Blue. This quest becomes permanently available after the update, with Trailblazers having to be Level 21 or above, as well as completing the prerequisite quests.</p>
<p>As stated above, there will also be a quest line for the Luminary Wardance, which also requires a Trailblaze Level 21 or above. For a more casual experience, there is also the Festive Revelry to participate in, which gives you access to traditional Luofu mini-games so you can take a break after participating in high stress questlines.</p>
<p>For those who would like to read the full patch notes of the "Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue" version 2.5 update for Honkai: Star Rail, they have released a <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details enemies added, as well as quality-of-life improvements to make the game more enjoyable for players. The update will end in October, giving players plenty of time to wrap up any loose ends from 2.5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS5 Pro Officially Announced, Launching in November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-officially-announced-launching-in-november.976986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looks like the rumors were true. During today's PlayStation Technical Showcase, Mark Cerny and Sony officially announced the PS5 Pro, and while it'll represent a substantial power increase over the PS5, that increase will come with a cost.</p>
<p>The showcase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal">was announced yesterday</a>, and prior to that, rumors were swirling that Sony would announce the PS5 Pro during the show. That's exactly what they've done, and lead architect Mark Cerny says it's "the most powerful console" Sony has ever built. It's arriving in November.</p>
<p>During the showcase, Cerny points out that when faced with a choice between Fidelity and Performance modes, Performance mode is chosen around 75% of the time. Cerny says he and Sony want to make that choice easier for players by upping the power of the PS5.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the PS5 Pro will focus on what Cerny calls "the big three" technical improvements: a larger-capacity GPU, advanced ray tracing capabilities, and a proprietary AI upscaling method that should make images look sharper and crisper.</p>
<p>According to Cerny, the PS5 Pro's GPU will offer up to 45% faster rendering than the standard PS5, while advanced ray tracing tech delivers results up to twice or three times as fast as the current base PS5 model.</p>
<p>As for that AI upscaling tech, it's called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, and it works in a similar way to existing tech like Nvidia's DLSS or AMD's FSR, analyzing game images and upscaling them using AI technology.</p>
<p>We got to see a number of examples of games running on the new PS5 Pro, and the machine does look pretty impressive, although I'd imagine that you'd need to see both running side-by-side for several minutes to really appreciate the differences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=QfSKhFCu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=ttVn-_d2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro is targeting three main pillars of improvement over the PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>Cerny says that PS5 Pro support will be added to new games and existing titles alike, and games like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, and <i>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</i>were shown.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this extra power comes at a price; the PS5 Pro will cost $699.99, so you'd better be sure you really need the improvements it's offering before you open your wallet.</p>
<p>There's another caveat that might sour the deal for you; the PS5 Pro will launch without a disc drive, so if you want one, you'll have to buy the one that Sony is selling separately. That feels like it's going to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7th, both at participating retailers and via PlayStation Direct. You'll be able to preorder it starting from September 26th.</p>

But if you want to play your physical games on the new console, you’ll have to pay extra: a disc drive isn’t included, so you’ll have to buy and install one separately for an additional $79.99.</p><p>“PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately,” Sony’s Hideaki Nishino <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">writes in a PlayStation Blog post</a>. That means if you are buying both the console and the disc drive together, you’ll be paying a whopping $779.98.</p><p>While very annoying — it sure seems like an expensive “Pro” console should come with a disc drive! — this move from Sony isn’t entirely out of left field. Sony first released the separate <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">PS5 disc drive</a> alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">the “slim” PS5 redesign</a>, giving you the option of adding a drive to an all-digital PS5 slim if you wanted after the fact. (Sony also sells a PS5 slim with the disc drive included.)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">PS5 Pro</a> launches on November 7th, and preorders start on September 24th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has three stripes down the side, and it doesn’t come with a disc drive. You’ll be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">purchase a 4K Blu-ray disc drive separately</a> and optional console covers.</p><p>“It’s the most powerful console we’ve ever built,” says Cerny. The hardware upgrades inside will result in 45 percent faster rendering, according to Cerny, and should improve the detail of certain games and frame rates. One of the key reasons for the PS5 Pro is to allow PS5 Pro players to not have to choose performance modes over fidelity ones. “Players are choosing performance about three-quarters of the time,” says Cerny.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>The new PlayStation 5 Pro, next to the </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23831415/new-ps5-model-removable-disc-drive-sony-price-release-date"><em>current standard PS5</em></a><em>, and a DualSense controller.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony has upgraded the GPU inside the PS5 Pro with 67 percent more compute units than the current PS5 console, and it has 28 percent faster memory, too. That all adds up to the 45 percent faster rendering of games and the ability to improve frame rates in titles without having to lose visual fidelity.</p><p>This extra power should also improve ray-traced games, with Sony suggesting that developers will be able to allow “the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro also includes Sony’s new AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) feature, which is essentially an upscaling technique similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR to improve frame rates and image quality for PlayStation games. This custom PSSR upscaling is designed to replace a game’s existing temporal anti-aliasing or upsampling implementation. </p><p>Cerny briefly demonstrated a few games running on the PS5 Pro, including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> with more detail while still targeting 60fps instead of the 30fps fidelity mode on PS5. Sony’s goal of fidelity-like graphics at performance frame rates will be available in games like <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>These are screenshots of Sony’s 4K resolution YouTube stream, and so many not show the full quality difference — but you get the idea.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshots by The Verge / Images by Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony is also including a PS5 Pro “Game Boost” option, which will apply to more than 8,500 backward-compatible PS4 games for the PS5 Pro. “This feature may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">says Hideaki Nishino</a>, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s platform business group. “Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro will also support Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, VRR, and 8K resolutions, and<em> CNET</em>’s Scott Stein, who got <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/">an early hands-on with the console</a>, says it now comes with a larger 2TB solid-state drive and swaps one of its rear USB-A ports for an extra USB-C port instead. It’ll also still include an extra SSD slot for expansion, too, he says.</p><p>Games will need to be patched to take advantage of some of the PS5 Pro’s features, and Sony says developers are readying free software updates to existing titles that will be labeled as PS5 Pro Enhanced games — up to 50 of them by its November 7th launch, according to <em>CNET</em>. </p><p>The first PS5 Pro Enhanced games will include <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>Demon’s Souls</em>, <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, <em>The Crew Motorfest</em>, <em>The First Descendant</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered. </em></p><p>Of the initial batch of titles, most should now simply feature 4K resolution and 60fps frame rate, but <em>CNET</em> also got to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> in a new 8K mode and a 4K ray-tracing mode. Developers can also reportedly add volumetric lighting or even show you more characters in the background of a scene.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is also compatible with the PlayStation VR2 headset — where Cerny told <em>CNET</em> it would eventually support higher-resolution games — the PlayStation Portal handheld, and existing PS5 controllers. Sony says it’s not changing the UI or network services for the PS5 Pro, so those will be identical to the existing console.</p><p>Preorders for the PS5 Pro will start on September 26th, ahead of the launch at retailers on November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>First up, the team detailed the unique campaign mechanic for each of the three upcoming legendary lords. For Orc Gorbad, that’s “Da Plan”. Lead designer Sean Macdonald describes it as “Gorbad experimenting with what different units in the roster can he pull together.” The example he gives is “send out some goblins in front of the archers and they can pick up the arrows. And it's like, well, now you've got a way to regenerate your ammunition during the battle.” To me, this sounds like various campaign and battle buffs you’ll get as you climb higher up the military chain, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>For Ogre Golfag Maneater, it’s all about contracts. “For the first time in Warhammer III we're trying to create a faction that plays like a mercenary," says Macdonald. You’ll take contracts from factions to fight others, but it sounds like this won’t affect your personal diplomatic relationship with the target faction. “We've created this new experience where he does kind of roam the world, taking on the jobs and beating up anyone he fancies."</p>
<p>For Khorne’s Skulltaker it’s…the taking of skulls, as it should be. “The whole idea of the feature is, seek out, you know, powerful characters, defeat them, claim some of their strength, and empower yourself even further so that you can become the ultimate Khorne champion," Macdonald explains.</p>
<p>As far as new units go, the team mention a generic savage orc shaman, Yhetees for the ogres, and two legendary heroes for Khorne: Scyla Anfingrimm and Skarr Bloodwrath. Elsewhere, there’s mention of tweaks for Kislev and Bretonnia mentioned, new magical items, and a new chaos invasion endgame event. Game Director Rich Aldrige also hints towards more weapon variants for some units, ala <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">the boys</a>. And that’s all the Warhammer that’s fit to shout “Warhammer” at for now. See you at the next Warhammer. Warhammer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>According to Ukrainian government-run website United24 Media, Ukraine's armed forces are using Steam Decks to remote-control gun turrets in the course of the on-going war with Russia. The site has shared a video of a new turret system, ShaBlya, which was apparently developed by Ukrainian engineers and approved for mass production earlier this year.</p> <!--more-->
<p>As described in <a href="https://x.com/United24media/status/1832807607758623209">the video</a>, the system is designed for use against infantry and lightly armoured targets. It's not clear from the video how the system works in practice, but it looks like operators can view camera feeds from the turret and shoot at people and vehicles using the Steam Deck's built-in controls. Having done a bit of digging of my own, Ukraine's military appear to have been experimenting with the Steam Deck <a href="https://x.com/krides/status/1650573735168995329">since April 2023</a>. Valve have yet to acknowledge or comment on all this - I'll let you know if they do.</p>
<p>The footage is a reminder that the games industry and the military sector are heavily enmeshed. The overlap isn't just limited to military engineers hacking consumer devices - military technology and practices and video game development and production are entangled at many levels, in what has become a circular exchange of ideas and expertise. Game engine company Unity have taken on military contracts to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/unity-dogfight-simulation-air-force-kill-chain/">work on battlefield simulations for training purposes</a>. So have Bohemia Interactive, in addition to working on their own, fictitious yet "authentic" war simulations for consumer usage - their attention to detail has reached the point that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bohemia-warns-against-spread-of-fake-israelipalestinian-conflict-videos-actually-created-in-arma-3">people have successfully passed off videos of Bohemia games as real war footage</a>. The US military has a long history of adapting video game controller technologies to work with <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/us-military-video-game-controllers-war/">drones, unmanned vehicles and submarines</a>.</p>
<p>Video games developers have, of course, borrowed ample material from the military sector, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">licensed guns in Call Of Duty</a> through the fact that Helldivers 2 is grounded in <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/helldivers-2/developers-military-conscription">its developers' experience of military service</a> to the many live service games that cast you as some kind of private military contractor. People Make Games recently published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k">a comprehensive video on the subject</a> which is worth sitting through.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro on Tuesday, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with it came the revelation</a> that the price of the console will be $200 more than the base PS5.</p>



<p>If you want to buy a PS5 Pro, it’s going to cost you $699.99/£699.99. The original base PS5 costs $499.99/£479.99, and that includes a disc drive for the system. The digital-only base PS5 retails for just $449.99/£389.99</p>



<p>Should you still want a disc drive for physical media, you’ll have to spend another $80/£99.99 for the attachable disc drive. That’ll put the price of a PS5 Pro up near $800 and well over £800.</p>



<p>So, in some cases it’ll cost $200/£200 more whereas others could be looking at $350/£350 more.</p>



<p>As far as what you’ll get for the expensive console, you get the PS5 Pro system, a DualSense controller, and a copy of the four-year-old game Astro’s Playroom. Inside the console comes a 45% more powerful GPU, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling, and more advanced ray tracing. You can check out more details on the full specs of the PS5 Pro, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right here</a>.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7, 2024. Preorders open later this month.</p>

<p>The company that compels you to industrialize an untouched alien planet in <em>Satisfactory, </em>FICSIT, is similar to <em>Portal</em>'s Aperture Science or&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>'s Vault-Tec. You are a disposable employee, fed misinformation and pushed to ignore awful or incongruous things, all for the greater good of science, profit, or an efficient mixture of the two.</p>
<p>And yet even FICSIT was a bit concerned about how deep into the 1.0 release of <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory">Epic Games</a>, on sale until 9/23) I had fallen. I got a warning that I had been playing for two hours straight. While FICSIT approved of hard work, it was important to have <em>some</em> work-life balance, it suggested.</p>
<p>Friends of mine had told me that they had to stop playing&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em> when it began to feel like an unpaid part-time job. Given a chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, I presumed, like I always do, That Could Never Be Me. Folks, it was definitely me. I'm having a hard time writing this post, not because it's hard to describe or recommend <em>Satisfactory.&nbsp;</em>I just stayed up very late "reviewing" it, woke up thinking about it, and am wondering whether enough friends would want to join me that I should set up a private server.</p>

<h2>Travel the galaxy, meet interesting creatures, ignore them and automate</h2>
<p>You are a Pioneer, working for FICSIT (motto: "We do anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems"). You are dropped onto an alien planet, with a first-person view, and your first job is to disassemble your landing craft so you can use its parts for a H.U.B. (Habitat and Utility Base). Your second job is to upgrade your H.U.B. so you can build tools and workshops. Your third job is to upgrade it again, unlocking even more tools and workshops. You'll need resources to keep building, like mined ore, fuel for a generator, and, sadly, animal parts for research.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>How should you feel about the lush landscape you are slowly stripping away and populating with smoke-belching machines? Is there a greater plan for all this stuff you're making? Why is a "Space Elevator" the end goal? How bad should you feel about putting down animals that charge you as you invade their space?</p>
<p>You might think about these things, but there's a stronger pull on your brain. Can you better optimize the flow of ore from a mining machine into the smelter, onto the tool machine (Constructor), and then into a storage bin? What about your power—do you really have to manually feed your system leaves and wood and turn it off between productions? Are we really balancing the wattage input and clock speed of our machines <em>in our spare time</em>, for&nbsp;<em>fun</em>?</p>
<h2>5.5 million copies, a thousand hours, no end in sight</h2>
<p>Yes, we are. I have only glimpsed into my future in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, and it's already full of excuses for why I didn't get other things done. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/krs37j/top_10_tips_from_540_hours_of_playtime/">People with 540 hours into the game</a> are advising me on how to site my permanent factory while I kludge it out with a "starter factory," a wonderfully evocative phrase about human nature. Searching for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=satisfactory+1000+hours&amp;atb=v371-1&amp;ia=web">people with 1,000 hours</a> of experience yields a remarkable number of people who are still asking questions and figuring things out.</p>
<p>One of the things being added into the 1.0 release is a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkZ6CDH7Zss">Quantum Encoder</a>." I have no idea what this is or what it does, but I have a sense of where this is all headed.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jt4XOPiPJHs?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Coffee Stain Studios' 1.0 release trailer for <em>Satisfactory</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Satisfactory</em> launched exclusively on the Epic Games Store, and was one of the very few games that earned enough to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/only-one-of-epics-first-wave-of-exclusives-made-money-and-it-wasnt-metro/">actually make Epic some money</a>. Its developer, Coffee Stain Studios (maker of&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator</em>, publisher of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>), cites 5.5 million copies sold since it hit early access in March 2019. With its 1.0 release, the developer has promised "Premium plumbing," such that the toilet in your living quarters "has been updated with an advanced flushing mechanism, providing an extra luxurious worker experience for fans."</p>
<p>Perhaps my one saving grace is that&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>is "Playable," not Verified, <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/526870">on Steam Deck</a>. There are some text and input quirks and video efficiencies to contend with, though I fear the active community offers solutions for all of them. It's up to me, and all of us, to find some work/life/game-work/sleep balance. Time to do your part.</p>

It's also important to note that Space Marine 2 hasn't had a full weekend under its belt yet with the general public, so it's possible the game sees even more concurrent players from September

                <p>Coffee Stain Studios' sci-fi factory sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> is now fully available, with the game's 1.0 update out now on PC adding new endgame content, additional customization options, and the full implementation of its story. The update also comes with the official confirmation from Coffee Stain Studios that a console version is in development.</p><p dir="ltr">No other details on the planned console release, like a release window, have been revealed. Coffee Stain in a press release only confirmed that it's in development as the studio looks "to bring conveyor-belt goodness to even more budding Pioneers."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt4XOPiPJHs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jt4XOPiPJHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-gets-a-1-0-release-and-flushable-toilets-in-september/1100-6524709/" data-ref-id="1100-6524709">massive 1.0 update</a>, which comes after five years in early access, eight years of total development, and over 5.5 million copies sold, there's a lot for factory aficionados to sink their teeth into. The 1.0 update adds Satisfactory's endgame, Tier 9 and Phase 5, where players will be able to use Quantum Technology to better ship goods off planet via a space elevator, and see the game's Save The Day program to its completion.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the alien technology players will be able to take advantage of include portals for near instant transportation and Dimensional Depots to more efficiently store and retrieve inventory. These powerful new tools allow for even more possibilities, but also require a large amount of power.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who love to customize and decorate their factories, there are plenty of new options in the 1.0 update. Factories can now be outfitted with windows, fences, and new paint finishes, and players can now customize their uniform, helmet, and build gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Satisfactory's 1.0 launch also sees the addition of achievements, with Coffee Stain stating the full list of achievements spans ones related to the game's core milestones, as well as achievements that reward exploration and "even a couple of memes thrown in as well." Unfortunately, achievements will not be retroactively awarded for those who have already completed them prior to the update, with the reason being that the 1.0 update "adds or changes something in almost every progression stage in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Coffee Stain Studios states that the 1.0 release "does not mark the definitive end for the game's development," but is nonetheless a "colossal milestone for our team as much as for our community." Satisfactory is available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-playstation-5-pro-has-finally-been-unveiled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">Sony has debuted the PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The new console will land on November 7, 2024 and retail for $699.99.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The PS5 Pro will feature three key upgrades including a larger GPU for rendering that's up to 45 percent faster than the base model. Sony also made major upgrades to ray-tracing by taking a "streamlined and accelerated approach that allows for calculation of rays at double or even triple the speeds of PS5."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, the company added custom hardware for machine learning via an AI library called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) that analyses game images pixel by pixel and can "add an extraordinary amount of detail that boosts the effective resolution of the games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on why Sony has focused on those areas specifically, PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny said the company wanted to address developers' "desire for more graphics performance." He said the PS5 Pro will lessen the need for developers and players to choose between performance mode and graphics mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When asked to decide on the mode, players are choosing 'performance' at least three quarters of the time. Removing that decision, or narrowing that divide, is one of the key targets for PlayStation 5 Pro," he said. "We wanted to give players the graphics that game creators aspire to, at the higher frame rates players typically prefer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that PS5 developers are already working on adding PS5 Pro support to existing titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gran Turismo 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to enhance performance across the board.

            <p>Sony has officially unveiled its next iteration of the PS5, or to give it its full name, the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The digital-only PS5 Pro is set to arrive on 7th November. It will cost £699.99/$699.99. Preorders will begin later this month, on 26th September. It will include a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and - as the PS5 did  - a copy of Astro's Playroom pre-installed. As a general point, you will need to buy the vertical stand separately (£24.99).  </p>
<p>
The separate disc drive is also compatible - as per the current Slim model - but costs an additional £99.99. If you want to purchase everything, you are looking at a total of £825.</p>

The main benefit of the PS5 Pro is it will allow for Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates. It does this with three key features, as laid out by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">PlayStation</a>:

</p><p><strong>Upgraded GPU:</strong> With PS5 Pro, we are upgrading to a GPU that has 67 percent more Compute Units than the current PS5 console and 28 percent faster memory. Overall, this enables up to 45 percent faster rendering for gameplay, making the experience much smoother.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing:</strong> We've added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</p>
<p><strong>AI-Driven Upscaling:</strong> We're also introducing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, an AI-driven upscaling that uses a machine learning-based technology to provide super sharp image clarity by adding an extraordinary amount of detail.</p>
<p>Additionally, the console has PS5 Pro Game Boost, which PlayStation says will apply to "more than 8,500 backward compatible PS4 games playable on PS5 Pro".</p>
<p>Says PlayStation: "This feature may stabilise or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games. PS5 Pro will also launch with the latest wireless technology, Wi-Fi 7, in territories supporting this standard. VRR and 8K gaming are also supported."</p>

</figure>
<p>As for how it will fit into your home, the PS5 Pro is the same height as the original PS5 model, and the same width as the current PS5 model. </p>
<p>PlayStation said several titles including Demon's Souls, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart (pictured above) will be patched with a free software update, which will allow them to "take advantage" of the PS5 Pro's souped-up features. These games will all come with a 'PS5 Pro Enhanced' label within their title, so keep an eye out for that. </p>
<p>Here are all the games we know will have PS5 Pro support so far, with "more" promised down the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</li>
</ul><p>

 As you would expect, all current PS5 accessories such as PlayStation VR2, PlayStation Portal, DualSense Edge, Access controller, Pulse Elite and Pulse Explore will be compatible with the PS5 Pro. Additionally, the user interface and network services will remain the same as those on PS5, PlayStation said.

<p>Today's PS5 Pro reveal comes as no real surprise. After all, Sony's official 30th anniversary artwork, which the company shared towards the end of last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">appeared to tease the next version of its PS5 console</a>, and here it is in all its glory much as the drawing depicted.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-increases-price-of-playstation-5-dualsense-controller">increased the price of the PS5's DualSense controller</a>. Coincidence? </p>

		<p>Mirage 7 has been announced by developer Drakkar Dev, whose previous release was Blackwind, and publisher Blowfish Studios. The game is very different to the mech based brawler that Blackwind is, with Mirage 7 being an action adventure game that is set in a desert part inspired by the Arabian Nights mixed with science fiction elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJVAdvxOoU">YouTube</a></p>


<p>“Mirage 7&nbsp;offers an unforgettable story with dynamic, narrative-driven gameplay,” said Manlio Greco, founder, Drakkar Dev. “We’ve crafted a game where daring explorers can truly immerse themselves in the world and experience a narrative that will keep them on their toes until the very end!”</p>
<p>In Mirage 7, players take on the role of an adventurer named Nadira, who is braving the desert and its dangers to reach the Palace of the Moon. Her goal is to bring her sister back from the dead. On this journey, Nadira is accompanied by Jiji, her pet lizard, who can be used to help solve the environmental puzzles that are scattered across the world. Alongside puzzles, Nadira will get in battles with various enemies, but she can use her dagger for close combat or a slingshot to get some range. There will also be choices to make as other characters try to use Nadira for their own means. Those characters include the Vizier and the Witch of Jala.</p>

<p>Mirage 7 will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC and Mac via Steam, Epic Game Store, and GOG. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>If you've been curious about V Rising and what it feels like to be a vampire, you can sink your fangs into the game for free during the free weekend commencing September 12 and finishing on September 16. The free weekend starts at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 12 and finishes at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 16. These five days allow those who haven't experienced the survival open-world RPG to dive deep into the world of V Rising, customize, and create their very own vampire while gaining more and more power as they defeat powerful enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB_2ZRn9F_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Players won't be limited during the V Rising free weekend. They will have access to all the content added in the <a href="https://playvrising.com/launch-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent 1.0 update</a> to give them a proper taste of V Rising. In this game, you can either team up with friends or strangers or go your way while choosing the difficulty of your world. Whether you want to be able to go through the world and only fight mobs, or you want the possibility to encounter other vampires and kill them, too, V Rising allows you to experience both PvE and PvP, depending on your choices.</p>
<p>If you really enjoy V Rising, the base game will also be discounted by 30%, and the DLCs will be discounted by 20% if you want to add some Castlevania spice to your game. For those who don't know much about the game, there are over 57 unique bosses for you to take down, all providing their challenges. In addition, you must avoid the sunlight, otherwise you are at risk of burning to death. To really sink your teeth into the vampiric and Gothic fantasy, you can build your very own castle where you can launch raids on others and defend your castle from towering enemies that threaten to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Currently, V Rising has a very dedicated fan base of over 4.3 million players worldwide. Since the game left Early Access, it has received overwhelmingly positive reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The developers are continuing to add new content and updates to the game to make it more accessible and enjoyable for those who continue to put time into it. V Rising is available on PC as well as PlayStation 5. If you want to see what V Rising has in store for you, a launch trailer showcases some of the action you can expect from playing the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-legends-battletech-shadowrun-jordan-weisman<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadowrun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BattleTech&nbsp;</em>designer Jordan Weisman has announced&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends</em>, a new open-world CRPG based on the tabletop game of the same name, and it's getting a Kickstarter campaign very soon.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>is essentially "a new&nbsp;<em>Sid Meier's Pirates&nbsp;</em>game with the tactics and narrative of&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>'s deckbuilding mechanics". Now there's an elevator pitch for the ages.</p>
<p>You'll play as a pirate who must build their reputation "from scallywag to pirate king" in a Caribbean contested not only by political factions, but also by "the denizens of the deep, the undead, and worse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-legends-open-world-crpg-jordan-weisman-dialogue.jpg?itok=cT-MrVfL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-legends-open-world-crpg-jordan-weisman-dialogue.jpg?itok=8LsXF5wk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>will be a pirate-themed CRPG in which you'll contend with political factions, the undead, and more (although this shot is just a mock-up).</figcaption></figure><p>The dev team on&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>consists not only of Weisman, but also, appropriately enough, of several other people who might be described as legends in their own right.</p>
<p>They include&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun: Dragonfall&nbsp;</em>lead writer Andrew McIntosh,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>narrative designer Jeffery Campbell, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull &amp; Bones</a>&nbsp;</em>senior concept artist Kate Cruz, plus Weisman himself, of course.</p>
<p>Weisman and his team say you'll be plundering ships, raiding towns, discovering treasure, and vanquishing your nemeses on this pirate adventure. Perhaps&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>can provide the piratical fantasy&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't quite manage to offer.</p>
<p>Combat will be driven by deckbuilding elements, and you'll develop your deck via recruiting crew members and developing characters. We don't have too much more info yet, but it's early days, after all.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter for the game starts on October 1st, so you'll get a chance to support the project if you want to see it come to fruition. We'll bring you more on this one as and when we get it.</p>
