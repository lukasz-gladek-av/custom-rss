            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/conquest-dark-hands-on-preview-vampire-survivors-cosmic-horror-conan-the-barbarian-yes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">My first ritual was ended by a large man with two morningstars swinging around him in a circle. Think the hands of a clock — one short, one long — but spikier and much, much more deadly, and equally inevitable as time, at least to the novice. I was playing a Barbarian that run; I didn’t understand what I was doing yet, or how to avoid them. My dodges weren’t dodging. I’d done pretty well up until that point, but he chewed through my lives like a dog with a bone, and then I was dead, my ritual incomplete. But I’d gotten somewhere, earned some upgrades, had a better idea of what I was doing. Time to try again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest Dark is a strange beast. It clearly owes a lot to Vampire Survivors, but its inspirations don’t quit there. It’s also pulling from stuff like Conan the Barbarian — your characters look like they can bench press a car but start with little more than a loincloth — and some cosmic horror, as a treat. There isn’t much story in Conquest Dark, but the actual setup is cool. After the arrival of something called The Black Planet 237 years ago, humanity stands on the brink of annihilation. Undead armies have laid waste to the great human kingdoms. The Cosmic Gods have fallen. The Primordial Ones have awoken from their long slumber. Only Kharathia, The City of Legends, still stands, one last hope for humanity. In a last, desperate effort, people of all stripes — heroes, criminals, devotees of old gods, those seeking glory — complete Dark Rituals to summon the undead hordes and fallen heroes to gain power, hoping to use it to uncover the secrets of the Black Planet and reclaim what they can.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Conquest Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a cool conceit, but Conquest Dark isn’t one for exposition. Most of this is delivered as text, and it’s up to you to stitch things together. You see it in the little details. The named bosses, like Lord Commander Urien, who appears outside Kharathia. Who was he before? A protector of the city, now turned against it in undeath? What about Witch Smeller Mzawi in the Shifting Sands? How do you smell witches, and what do you do if you catch a whiff of one? What happened at The Chasm of Fallen Heroes? Who was S’hes, why did she hunt Titans, and what specifically did she do to have an order of hunters named after her? What is the Black Planet? Where did it come from? I don’t know how interested in answering these questions Conquest Dark is, but every time I went to a new place, saw what was there, or learned a little bit more from a description, I was intrigued.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dark Rituals, Big Choices</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In practice, Conquest Dark is pretty simple: you go to an area on the map to start a Dark Ritual. Once you’ve selected where you want to be, it’s time to figure out who. You’ve got a trio of characters to select from, and you can reroll those options as many times as you like. You only have one race (Human) and two classes (Hunter and Barbarian) from the jump, though you’ll quickly get more. I won’t spoil the additional races, but the new classes like the agile Thief, paladin-esque Oathkeeper, and the spellcaster-flavored Acolyte of Kuu, all do exactly what they sound like. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s start from, well, the start. The Hunter is faster and more nimble and naturally inclined towards bows and ranged attacks, while the Barbarian has more health and bleed resistance, and thrives up close and personal with melee weapons, but what might be more interesting are the randomly generated proficiencies they get right from the jump. An extra 5% critical hit damage, 2.5% bonus health, or 5% reduced bleed rate may not seem like a big deal, but it can define who you want your character to be, and how you upgrade later. I particularly like that you can reroll your three starting choices as much as you want, for free, or leave an area entirely at no cost if you decide this isn’t where you wanna be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>No matter who you pick, your character starts with nothing more than a loincloth and their fists. That doesn’t last long, though.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve got your guy (or gal), the fun begins. First, you select an origin. Veteran of the War gives you Heavy Armor, Shields, and 25% Bonus Health, while Hunter’s Apprentice adds Short Bow proficiency, Survival, and 0.5 Projectile Pierce. It’s important to note that you can double-up here. If you’re playing as a Hunter, you probably shouldn’t take Hunter’s Apprentice, for instance, because you already have two of those proficiencies, but it would be great for a Barbarian that wants to play the ranged game. If you play things, right, you can essentially multi-class: Oathkeepers are already hard to kill, but it’s even more difficult when you take the Stargazer origin, which gives you the Acolyte of Kuu’s barrier. Once you’ve got an origin, the games begin. No matter who you pick, your character starts with nothing more than a loincloth and their fists. That doesn’t last long, though. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After you smack your first undead back to the afterlife, you get your first major choice: your weapon. Some of your options might not seem all that important. Take a Hunter’s opening choices. Shortbow versus longbow’s not really that crucial, right? Wrong. Shortbows shoot faster, but do less damage per shot and have less range, while longbows take a little more time to fire, but hit harder and farther. Once you’re got your killing instrument of choice, things escalate. The first few waves are small, just so you have enough time to get used to things. Like Vampire Survivors, you don’t actually control much in Conquest Dark; just where you move and when you dodge. Attacking happens automatically. Instead, your focus is almost entirely on positioning. Where to be, when to dodge, keeping track of when abilities will activate, and being in a position to capitalize on that big shot or big swing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>I Ain’t Got Time to Bleed</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you level up, you’ll make more choices. What to equip, what abilities to upgrade, when to re-roll a selection you don’t like or skip it entirely for more currency for re-rolls later. There’s a ton of build variety here. I gravitated to builds with huge critical hit damage and high crit chance with the Hunter, but the Barbarian works well with AoE damage and by increasing the chance for enemies to drop health. Picking early and specializing seems to be key.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your real goal, aside from putting together a build that works, is staying alive as long as you can. See, you get 10 lives on each run. If you lose one, you start bleeding. The more lives you lose, the more you bleed. The first time you die, you start losing 1% of your health every second. The second time, that jumps to 2%. The third time makes it 3% and so on. There’s no way to stop bleeding once you start, but you can reduce it by speccing into health regeneration, reduced bleed rate, and how likely enemies are to drop health. Surviving long enough to complete a Ritual means staying alive after enemies cover every inch of the screen, and you start dying. The longer you can stave it off, the better, but the difference between a failed run and a successful one is how long you can hang on once things go sideways and the bosses start showing up. Like you, they have a lot of lives, and they can get pretty nasty, swinging morningstars or not. They’re tough, but if it bleeds, you can kill it. I’ve had the most success as a Hunter, Oathkeeper, and the Acolyte of Kuu (I like standing far away from things and shooting them), but I admire how different each class feels and how they forced me to approach fights in unique ways that played to their strengths.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your real goal, aside from putting together a build that works, is staying alive as long as you can. See, you get 10 lives on each run. If you lose one, you start bleeding. The more lives you lose, the more you bleed. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you succeed or fail (and by the way, you die regardless; even if you succeed, an army of unkillable ghosts sweeps in to ruin your day. Oops), you’re going to unlock rewards, and then it’s back to the map to spend them to help future runs. Maybe that means heading to the Stygian Archive in Kharathia, where you can not only see everything you’ve unlocked, but also upgrade individual skills, weapon sets, abilities, and so on with the Soul Coins you get on each run. Or maybe you’re off to the Altar of Power to spend crystals for increased damage, or the Altar of Toughness to take a chunk out of that pesky bleed damage, or the Altar of Souls to make sure you can collect souls (experience) from farther away. And then there’s the Factions, like the aforementioned Order of S’hes, which rewards you with buffs for all classes for slaying things as a Hunter. And <em>then</em> there’s the Obelisk of the Moon, where you can ramp up the difficulty of performing Rituals for increased rewards by offering up Shards of the Black Planet. Then it’s back to a Ritual. Live, die, upgrade, repeat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Live, Die, Upgrade, Retry</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest Dark doesn’t stop and explain how all of this works off the bat, though there is a detailed game guide there if you want to do some light reading before you set off. Mostly, you learn by doing, and I like that. Put me in, coach, I’m ready to play, win or lose. And once you start unlocking more stuff, the wheels start turning. ‘What can I do with this class? How do I build around this thing? What if I tried taking this origin with this class? What can I <em>do</em>?” And once they start, they don’t really stop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview’s written, Lord Commander Urien (the dude with the morningstars) has been sent on his way, and I’ve seen several hours of Conquest Dark at this point. But I also can’t stop thinking about it, either. What I might try next, how I might upgrade certain things, what classes I want to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay here is remarkably simple. You just move and dodge (or use dodge-based abilities that can double as attacks), but there’s an elegance to it that I appreciate, and it kept me coming back with new ideas. Upgrades may be what put you over the top, but the magic happens when you step into the arena, in the moments between life and death. You’re going to die; that’s a given. The question is how far you can get (and how many horrors you can vanquish) before you do.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivions-original-level-scaling-system-which-is-still-in-oblivion-remastered-was-a-mistake-designer-admits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the heightened interest in all things The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion brought on by Bethesda’s popular remaster, its original designer has admitted the game's level scaling system was a “mistake.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion’s level scaling system is perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of the 20-year-old open-world role-playing game. It means loot acquired is tied to the level of your character at the point you acquire it. So, if you complete a quest for a coveted sword at level one, you’ll get that sword locked at level one power. If you complete the same quest at level 25, you’ll get the sword at level 25. This, frustratingly, locks that cool sword you got at level one to level one power for your entire playthrough, no matter how much you level up. In effect players could, through no fault of their own, complete quests too early, renedering unique items useless later in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, enemies will still spawn according to your level. While this allows the foes you face to always provide a challenge, it does present a problem if you aren’t focusing on certain skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to 2025 and some fans were shocked to find that Oblivion’s original level scaling system reappeared in Oblivion Remastered, when other parts of the game’s mechanics were modernized. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is very disappointing, especially when they said they went out of their way to fix the leveling system, which, to be fair, they did fix for player attributes,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k5mknf/fyi_for_remaster_level_scaling_is_still_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor minifat commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a> the game’s level scaling, or “world scaling” system was a “mistake.” Bethesda ended up changing the level scaling for 2011’s The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, which most fans believe was for the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems,” Nesmith said. “The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I’m intimately familiar with how both of those things work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the world leveling with you was a mistake and that’s proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in Skryim. That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me.’ "</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One area Oblivion Remastered did improve on was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/How_Leveling_Works_in_Oblivion_Remastered">leveling up your character</a>. In Oblivion Remastered, increasing both Minor and Major Skills now all contributes towards your next level, instead of only Major Skills providing any progress (Major Skills increase at a much faster rate, giving them a larger impact).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon resting in bed to begin the Level-up Screen, you're now presented with the list of Attributes and 12 Virtue Points. These points can be distributed among your Attributes (which cannot exceed 3, just like in the original), with a maximum of +5 points in any one Attribute (which was also the cap in the original).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the points can be allocated regardless of which skills you improved, you can now align your Attribute increases during each level up without fear of becoming underpowered by allocating points to Attributes that your character may not use as much. The only exception to this is Luck: It requires 4 Virtue Points for every point added to the Luck Attribute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have also been a few changes to how certain skills increase. Mercantile, for example, increases at rates that align with how expensive the item bought or sold is, and Magick Skills increase faster when using spells with a higher magick cost, making spamming low-level spells to increase skills faster a less effective method.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, modders have once again come to the rescue. Fresh from tackling PC performance issues in Oblivion Remastered, modders have also released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/182" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">balanced NPC level cap mods</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99?tab=description" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">balanced unleveled rewards mods</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/get-a-new-look-at-the-gorgeous-shinobi-art-of-vengeance-through-a-stage-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been more than a decade since we received an all-new Shinobi title, but thanks to Sega's recent initiative to revive dormant IPs from its deep catalog, the company is set to release Shinobi: Art of Vengeance later this year. The gorgeous revival comes from Lizardcube, the development team behind 2020's Streets of Rage 4, a franchise that was originally published by Sega.</p>

<p>This entry is the first all-new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi on 3DS. Unlike the Streets of Rage revival, which was published by Dotemu, Sega is partnering directly with Lizardcube to revitalize the Shinobi series. Late last week, Sega gave us about a minute of new gameplay, teasing the design of the stages in Shinobi: Art of Vengeance. Though the levels and encounters appear well-designed and engaging, the visual aesthetic continues to steal the show with every new glimpse at Lizardcube's next title.</p>

<p>You can view the new trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lLxNxbmRX0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 29. Those pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition can play three days before everyone else and receive additional in-game items, including currency, a Ghost outfit, a Medic Lite Amulet, and a Sega Villains Stage.</p>

It launched last week to generally rave reviews, and developer Sandfall Interactive announced it’s also performing similarly well sales-wise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developer took to <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331">X</a> yesterday to reveal it shipped over 1 million copies of the hit RPG in just three days (the game launched on April 24). Though marketed primarily by Xbox, Sandfall confirms this number does not include Xbox Game Pass players, so it appears the game is also selling well across PlayStation 5 and PC. It also seems the surprise launch of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/22/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-available-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> days earlier has not hindered the game’s success.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the debut title for French developer Sandfall Interactive and has garnered critical acclaim. It currently sits at a 92 critical score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>; we awarded it a 9 out of 10 in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33/melancholy-rpg-eminence">our review</a>. The adventure follows an expedition of adventurers on a mission to stop a mysterious paintress with the power to wipe out humans of a certain age every year. It boasts fast-paced turn-based action bolstered by third-person action elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As editor Kyle Hilliard noted in his review, “The world, art, and narrative are unique, but it makes me nostalgic for a game I remember from the past. It’s as though developer Sandfall Interactive managed to make a classic RPG with only the good parts. I’m sad in a way to have concluded the journey, but the adventure to pursue the Paintress will linger with me for some time.”</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The bean bag is a stone-cold classic. Filling professional lofts, student flats and playrooms since the 1960s, it’s a universal piece of lo-fi design, that was more or less perfected the first time out. That said, modern companies like <a href="https://www.bigberthaoriginal.com/">Big Bertha</a> have seen that there’s clear room for improvements, nipping and tucking the classic bean bag into new, more contemporary forms, with modern, harder-wearing fabrics and updated ‘beans’. What that amounts to, in the Big Bertha Ultra Lux Gaming Chair, is a bean bag that’s comfortable, can take some punishment, and is perfect for the longest gaming sessions you can muster.</p>
<p>To be sure we understand each other, bean bags are not full of beans of the baked, broad or green variety, and nor are they made from plastic or paper bags. The Ultra Lux is a fabric bean bag with an additional fabric chair back built into it, with the beans moving freely between the two and sculpting to your body when you settle down into it. Because it moulds to your body as you sit down it’s incredibly comfortable, and the extra structure of the chair back means that you’re also really well supported in a way I’ve not experienced from a bean bag before.</p>



<p>Our review chair came in grey cord, which, purely by luck, matched our sofa perfectly. If you happen to have bought a cord sofa in the past five years or so – there’s a good chance you’ve been to DFS at some point – you’ll know how soft and hard-wearing the fabric is, and through our testing it stood up to plenty of punishment, as well as the requisite popcorn and biscuit crumbs that any seat manages to accumulate, even when you haven’t eaten anything.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s stain resistant if you do have a food or drink based snafu, and refillable if someone manages to make their way through the dual zips – during our testing these thankfully stopped the inside beans becoming outside beans. The beans themselves are made from SupremeX polystyrene, which is designed to last longer and be more durable than competitors offerings, and through our time with the Ultra Lux, we’ve not noticed any noticeable loss of bean density, or the bag – in essence – deflating, so they appear to be doing exactly what they’re designed for.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I’ve had with the Ultra Lux is that I struggle to get into it. Not because I lack the flexibility to sit closer to the floor, but because my 8 year-old has claimed it as his own. For someone much smaller than myself it literally turns into a nest, and he’s generally found secured within it with Lego City on the TV and an iPad in hand looking far too pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Seriously, it’s almost upsetting how pleased with himself he is, and I have to be faster than an 8 year-old if I want to take my turn in the chair. Luckily, he goes to school and I get to stay at home some days, so the joke’s on him. Thanks to the headrest, it’s ideal for a sneaky midday nap, which I absolutely don’t do because I am consistently working hard.</p>
<p>While our review unit was grey, there’s a whole range of different colours and a choice of alternate fabrics to wrap your beans up in. The Aegean Blue colour that they use in a lot of their advertising looks particularly good, and I’m already thinking of picking up a second one for a different room.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ultra Lux, or indeed any of the Big Bertha bags, is that they don’t cost very much. You can currently pick one up direct from the Big Bertha website for £109.90, and I think that’s phenomenal value, particularly for the build quality and extreme comfort you’re going to experience for a very long time.</p>

				<p>Summary</p><p>
				If you're looking for a cost-effective and hugely comfortable gaming chair, it's well worth thinking about an Ultra Lux bean bag from Big Bertha. Not only are they a fraction of the price, unlike traditional gaming chairs, they're light enough to move around your home too. 			</p></div>

			<p>Straight4 Studios has announced that its upcoming sim racing game, Project Motor Racing, will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>At launch, Project Motor Racing will feature more than 70 vehicles across 10 racing classes and 27 track layouts. Straight4 Studios also showcased some gameplay in a new trailer released today, showing off some early, but still impressive, footage.</p>
<p>The trailer also included a cameo from professional racer Derek Bell, playing the game with a full <a href="https://wccftech.com/genesis-announces-the-seaborg-400-racing-wheel-controller/">racing sim setup</a>. It's a clear sign of the kinds of players that Project Motor Racing is targeting: the sim racing fan who went all-out to play their favorite kinds of games in the best way possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMerxYOaOm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The upcoming sim racer will have the expected modes, including a single-player career mode and an online multiplayer mode, which will feature leaderboards and "<em>full race weekends</em>" for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>While Project Motor Racing is being developed by Straight4 Studios, it's being built on publisher Giants Software's own GIANTS game engine. For chief executive officer of Giants Software, Christian Ammann, it's a new step forward for the studio and the beginning of a new era.</p>

You know he's there. Even before you found the bodies, it's almost like you felt his presence. Always watching. You feel like you're under a constant crosshair. But to save yourself from going mad, you've fallen back on your orders. Guard the facility, patrol the routes, but he's still there. You know he's there.</i></p>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is based on the popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/sniper-elite" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite</em></a> video game series. In this review, we'll look at how it plays and how it stacks up against the video game it's based on, and we'll also check out what the Eagle's Nest expansion adds to games. <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> was a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2020, and another expansion, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/rebellionunplugged/sniper-elite-operation-kraken" rel="nofollow">Operation Kraken</a>, is planned on Gamefound.</p>

You could be long gone as the guards close in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hidden Sniper Moving Target</h2>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is a hidden movement 1 vs many board game. What that means is that 1 player takes the role of the Sniper, and up to 3 players (or an AI card deck if playing solo) take on the role of the guards. The guards are split into 3 teams of 3, and their miniatures are placed on the map. During their turn, they can move and search areas, looking for the sniper.</p>

<p>The sniper, using a smaller separate copy of the game board, uses a dry-erase marker to track their movement, as they try and complete 2 objectives. Their miniature is kept off the board and secret, creating noise if they move too fast, which the defenders can track, narrowing their search area. The sniper miniature is only placed on the board if the defenders discover them, they complete an objective, or if they create too much noise when taking a shot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=wdhT5_Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=1GEhJogp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses radomly drawn tokens for shooting.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses an interesting, unique mechanic. It's an almost completely diceless board game (except a single die for solo play), and instead, when making a shot, players draw tokens from a bag. A number of aim tokens is required, equal to the number of spaces between you and your target (including your target's space). The number of tokens you draw is up to you, but if you draw 2 or more noise tokens, then your position is revealed, and if you draw a combination of 5 or more noise and recoil tokens, then you miss your shot regardless of how many aim tokens you draw. Tokens are added to the bag as the game progresses, such as more noise tokens for being spotted, or more aim tokens for taking out enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=Jc9wdOx9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=1EjQwmPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game </em>has a map where the action takes place, and a seperate map for the hidden sniper to track their movements.</figcaption></figure><h2>Boom Headshot</h2>

<p>There are only 2 maps in the core game box, but the variety comes from the random objectives, keeps the game varied for the sniper and the guards guessing. There are also 6 specialist abilities that each one of the guard commanders can choose 1 of, and 10 items that the sniper can choose 2 of. This combination of objectives, specialists, and items means that rarely will a game be the same.</p>

<p>The hidden nature of the game also keeps things fresh, and playing the guards made me super anxious. It's much simpler to have one player playing all 3 guard units, as they can work overlapping search areas, but having 3 makes it as complicated as 3 independent units would, each with their own ideas for where the sniper might be.</p>

<p>For the sniper player, I honestly thought going into the game that I would be blasting away the enemies of the Allied campaign as you do in the game, but it's actually better to fire no shots at all, and when you do fire, shoot an irrelevant target to confuse your opponents. Moving a target out of your way alerts them to your rough area and possible objective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=c8bCYrBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=Xi0ABjmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a load of new variety with new snipers and new maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Eagles Dare</h2>

<p>The <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a lot more variety to games. It includes 2 new maps, with solo defender control cards and new objective cards for them. It also includes some new equipment cards to help you navigate the cliffs and water of the Heavy Water map. The other map is set entirely inside Eagle's Nest, a challenging, claustrophobic room-to-room mission.</p>

<p>Eagle's Nest also includes 4 new sniper miniatures and stat cards to go with them, offering a variety of special abilities. Karl, the original <em>Sniper Elite</em> character, starts with the most aim tokens in the bag and can fire twice a turn. Rosa from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sniper-elite-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite 4</em></a> can only target enemies 5 spaces away, but only starts with 1 noise token. Jun, from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zombie-army-4-dead-war" rel="nofollow"><em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em></a> can remove multiple adjacent targets with a single shot, at the cost of adding noise tokens to the bag, and Major Eazy, from Battle comics, and starts the game with 3 noise and 3 aim tokens, but noise tokens count as aim tokens for him, so you can freely blast away.</p>

<h2>Sniper Elite the Board Game Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I honestly thought that I would have a completely different experience going into <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em>. I thought shooting would be a lot more prevalent than it is, and I didn't expect the hidden movement element to be so much fun. It captures an element of the video game perfectly, with the sniper having a feeling of such control, until things go wrong, and then things can deteriorate quickly. It is 2 vastly different experiences playing the guards or the sniper, both fun and challenging in their own right. The token bag for shooting plays into it all perfectly, and the risk/reward element is a pivotal focus of the game.</p>

<p>The Eagle's Nest expansion adds a lot more variety, with the extra maps doubling the number in the core set, and the extra snipers adding some very different styles of play. The core game stands alone as a great experience out of the box, and while the Eagle's Nest is a great addition, it is simply adding more variety on top of an already great and varied game.</p>

At a grade 9, those are currently valued at just under 5,000 USD, or 8,000 AUD.

Bruce Nesmith, a developer on the original Elder Scrolls IV, doesn't believe that will be the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/elder-scrolls-6-not-drowned-in-stats-focus-on-real-choices/" rel="nofollow ">VideoGamer</a>, Nesmith suggested player choices should trump stat management in The Elder Scrolls VI. "We don’t want the game to get in the way," said the former Bethesda developer. "And that's a very modern take on RPGs. And that is actually at the heart of the 'you do it to get better at it' [leveling mechanic] philosophy of The Elder Scrolls. Because that means I'm not having to pick my skills, I just play. Don't worry about all that crap if you don’t want to."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="461252385" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

already proven super popular</a>, with Bethesda revealing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/">the RPG has seen over 4 million players</a> so far. Nesmith noted that he's aware of "a movement to look back nostalgically at games that are more traditional RPGs." But he still believes the large majority of people "just want to play fun games" instead of being "drowned in stats and all this other stuff."</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nesmith argues that more than anything, "players appreciate having real choices in the game." Nesmith points to the Fallout franchise, as he previously worked on Fallout 3 (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-fallout-3-remaster-should-improve-this-original-dev-says/1100-6531095/">offered his suggestions for that remaster</a>). "And you can see that in the reactions to the various Bethesda games," said Nesmith. "The decision-making in Fallout 3 that you could make in terms of how your character responded with karma and being able to finish quests in different ways compared to Fallout 4 [where] there's really only one way to succeed, there was only one moral choice except for the grand main quest, players like that."</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/">Nesmith was blown away by Oblivion Remastered</a>, saying, "I'm not sure remaster actually does it justice." Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios head and creative director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/">Todd Howard confirmed that The Elder Scrolls VI is being worked on</a> after the release of Oblivion Remastered.

		<p>Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine have announced that their realistic modern warfare tactical game Broken Arrow is coming out on 19th June. A deluxe Vanguard Edition is also available for pre-order on Steam, giving three days early unlock from 16th June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Broken Arrow, named after US military term for an accidental nuclear weapon event that does not create a risk of war, and not after the 1996 John Travolta film, sees fictional conflict between US and Russian militaries in the Baltic region. Players will command infantry, recon, support vehicles, aircraft and more in a battle for supremacy through a single player campaign and 5v5 online multiplayer. You’re not building up a base in battle, but are instead looking to capture and hold strategic points and calling in reinforcements from off-map.</p>
<p>While it has the appearance of a hard-nosed military simulator, Steel Balalaika aims to be accessible to both newcomers and RTS experts. A key hook is the army-building system that allows for unit customisation using the more-than-300 realistic military units.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game through early playtesting, and there’s certainly a lot to take in. “While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game,” I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow preview</a>, “there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.”</p>

            <p>Skatebird, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>, and Electric Zine Maker are three of the 237 games you can grab on Itch right now for $16 as part of <a href="https://itch.io/b/2965/crips-for-esims-for-gaza-bundle">Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle</a>. Why, that's a $822 saving! I mean, it's technically not a saving if you weren't going to buy anything anyway, but it's for a good cause. Here's the collective in their own words:</p>
<p>"Crips for eSims for Gaza is an international collective of disabled people who have come together in support of Palestinans, helping Gazans regain internet access via eSims (electric sim cards) connected to surrounding networks in Israel and Egypt," reads their <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/">Itch page</a>. "We recognize that everyone in Gaza is now in some way disabled due to the massive number of deaths, traumatic injuries, life-threatening illnesses and near complete destruction of medical facilities".</p>

<p>They've also made a <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/what-is-an-esim">printable mini-zine</a> explaining the importance of e-sims, which is more than I've ever done to explain an indie soulslike's parry system but maybe I should start.</p>
<p>Baba Is You is a personal favourite here. John (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baba-is-you-review">was keen too</a>. "Sublimely refined in every respect," wrote he. "It understands the player, letting you reset a screen with a single button, never penalising you for undos, and even lets you switch off its wibbly-wobbly graphic effect if it starts to drive you potty."</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/">collective's website here</a>. And remember, kids: There is no culture war, there are simply your feelings on the appropriate response to tyranny - disgust or cowardly, Stockholm-ish acquiescence. Enjoy video games!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has quietly updated another one of its games, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/far-cry-4/" data-ref-id="5000-275475">Far Cry 4</a> can now run at 60fps on PS5. Curiously, the Xbox 360 version of Far Cry 4 did run at 60fps on Xbox Series X|S using the FPS Boost function, but it was later disabled. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-joining-game-pass-in-april-and-may-2025-including-clair-obscur-and-call-of-duty/2900-6478/">Far Cry 4 will also be added to Game Pass this month</a>, so it might also be getting a fresh update.</p><p>Far Cry 4 was previously locked to 30fps on PS5, and this graphical improvement (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1kacv3l/far_cry_4_now_runs_on_60_fps_on_ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Reddit</a>) follows a recent trend of Ubisoft revisiting some of its older games. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shows-it-hasnt-totally-forgotten-about-splinter-cell/1100-6531177/">Splinter Cell: Blacklist was updated to support Steam achievements</a> and not too long ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-assassins-creed-game-from-nearly-a-decade-ago-just-got-a-60fps-patch/1100-6527835/">Assassin's Creed Syndicate got a 60fps patch</a> on Xbox Series X|S and PS5.</p><p>Beyond that bit of news, there will now be a new focus on the Far Cry series now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">Ubisoft has made a major change to its organization</a>. The company recently announced the formation of a new subsidiary focused specifically on its Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, and Tencent owns a minority stake in it after investing $1.25 billion.</p><p>The last Far Cry game released was Far Cry 6 back in 2021, and there have been rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-wants-to-reinvent-the-far-cry-series-with-its-next-two-games-report/1100-6528543/">Ubisoft wants to shake up the franchise's open-world formula for its next two entries</a>. One of these rumored games--an extraction-based multiplayer shooter under the codename of Project Maverick--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-multiplayer-extraction-game-has-been-rebooted-far-cry-7-could-release-in-2026-report/1100-6529853/">has reportedly been rebooted</a> while work continues on Operation Blackbird, which is said to be Far Cry 7.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/broken-arrow-release-date-finally-revealed-after-four-years.1176246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/broken-arrow-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>release date, just about four years after the fast-paced tactical RTS was initially announced.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537726178354528747" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, described by the two studios as "the most wishlisted strategy game on Steam" (although its wishlists do still pale in comparison to the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">still-absent&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>), launches on June 19th.</p>

<p>The game, which was originally revealed all the way back in May 2021, will set you back $49.99 when it's released, but it won't be an Early Access release, unusually; it'll be arriving fully formed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=aiOoSwq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=RCCWdcFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fast-paced tactical RTS&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>is finally arriving this June.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing the release date, Slitherine and Steel Balalaika have also unveiled a new edition of&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>for which pre-orders are now open.</p>

<p>The Vanguard Edition will set you back $10 extra, and it packs in that now-common three-day early access (as opposed to Early Access) period, allowing you to play&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>three days ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>You'll also get a digital soundtrack comprising 41 "intense and energetic bangers", as well as nine "beautiful" digital wallpapers representing&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>'s "specialization decks". On top of that, you'll get exclusive vehicle skins too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, you can tune into Slitherine's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/slitherinetv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a> tomorrow at 10am Eastern, where the studio will be showcasing a "never-shown-before mission" in the form of Kaliningrad.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, its developers describe it as a "large-scale real-time modern warfare tactics game" that features "a unique army building system and deep unit customization tools".</p>

<p>The game will feature two major factions, the Americans and the Russians, as well as a full-scale campaign. You'll even be able to use the same scenario editor used to create the campaign's missions to make your own scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on June 19th.</p>

It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/against-the-storm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/against_the_storm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, as well as via Game Pass.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hooded Horse:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A dark fantasy city builder where you must rebuild civilization in the face of apocalyptic rains. As the Queen’s Viceroy, lead humans, beavers, lizards, foxes, and harpies to reclaim the wilderness and secure a future for civilization’s last survivors.</p><p>You are the Viceroy—a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization’s last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most <a title="Genres > Survival [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end—but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Diverse Population of Villagers</strong></p><p>Foxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group’s strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?</p><p><strong>City Builder Meets <a title="Genres > Roguelite [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">Roguelite</a></strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?</p><p><strong>Never the Same Game Twice</strong></p><p>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.</p><p><strong>Build an Endless Number of Cities</strong></p><p>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you’ll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Against the Storm - Console Release Date Trailer | Dark Fantasy/Roguelite City Builder" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVr9ccNLxXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is unlikely to use the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering like Oblivion Remastered does, as it would do little to address some of the most common Creation Engine complaints, like the fragmented game world.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry responded to a fan's question about whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a test for the next entry in the series. They highlighted the possibility is definitely there, as other studios have done something similar in the past, essentially making Unreal Engine their own, like Housemarque with Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it seems unlikely that The Elder Scrolls VI will use Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, as the Epic engine would not solve any of the most significant issues of the Creation Engine by itself. As highlighted by Oblivion Remastered, the Unreal Engine 5 was still limited by the Gamebryo engine powering the rest of the game, and the game world was still as fragmented as it was in the original. At the same time, rendering was not exactly an issue in Starfield, and with the Creation Engine likely getting rendering improvements for The Elder Scrolls VI, having Unreal Engine 5 rendering would only serve to delay the game further, complicate development and potentially add performance issues, as Oblivion Remastered is extremely heavy and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">runs poorly on pretty much everything that isn't a top end machine with frame generation on top.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #211: Days Gone Remastered PS5 Pro, Ghost of Yōtei Reaction, Switch 2 Game Keys!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nBPJOJOzAU?start=4933&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With The Elder Scrolls VI still far from release, the launch of Oblivion Remastered allows players to return to Tamriel ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series. Despite performance issues and some visual changes, the remaster is a game worth experiencing, keeping the original's magic intact, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>. The game is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> may have been released over a decade ago (yes, really), but Ubisoft clearly isn't done updating it.</p>
<p>Far Cry 4 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2014-far-cry-4">which first made its debut in November 2014</a> - is set to receive an update for the PlayStation 5, which will see it able to run at 60fps. It has been able to do this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dxJFCgkNws">Xbox Series X/S since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The notes for this particular Far Cry 4 PlayStation update are pretty snappy. It simply says Version 1.08 introduced "support 60 FPS on PS5 console", so there you have it.</p>
<p>This is not the first Ubisoft game to get itself a boost like this. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-odyssey-gets-60fps-support-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-tomorrow">Assassin's Creed Odyssey got itself a 60fps update</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2021. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-ps5-pro-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-enhancements">also got one in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>Now, fans are hopeful that more Far Cry releases will also get themselves a 60fps boost. In fact, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1kacv3l/comment/mplpid3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> has even said they will offer up their soul to Ubisoft if grants <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> some 60fps love (and fixes some controller issues). This seems a touch excessive to me, but I would also be pretty happy heading back to the Rook Islands for a little nosey around with an improved framerate accompanying me.</p>
<p>"Far Cry 4 does all the things that its predecessor did and more - more weapons, more vehicles, more modes, more ground to cover - so if all you're looking for is a big old wide open space to tear up with a friend, go forth and make merry with mortar," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-4-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 4 review</a>. "Far Cry 4 is well worth a visit, but it's more a backpacker's delight than a five-star island paradise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Put thoughts of the John Travolta and Christian Slater film to one side, as outside of the name referring to nuclear weapons going missing, Broken Arrow is not related in any way. Instead this is a tactical modern era wargame looking to take on the RTS niche when it launches in June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For our hands on time with Broken Arrow, we jumped right in at the deep end, playing multiplayer with a bunch of far more experienced players who had already sunk hours and hours into the game. In a way, this was actually the best way for a newcomer to see how the game works, with a 5v5 tussle for control over objectives spread across the map. Going toe-to-toe with players that have already figured out the ins and outs of how the game works wasn’t going to go well, so instead I was able to focus on smaller, less pivotal control points, while soaking in the action going on elsewhere.</p>


<p>Broken Arrow emphasises the more tactical aspects of warfare. There’s no base building here, but you do all bring your units out from set spawn points, having them race across the map in the early parts of battle to try and quickly establish frontlines and defensive positions with as many of the map’s control points in your hands as possible.</p>
<p>Units are broken down into six categories, with speedy recon units, infantry, tanks, support, artillery and air, drawing from the two sides of this particular war – the US and Russia. However, there’s a lot of crossover between these categories. Just summoning a squad of soldier is going to be pretty useless when it then takes them 15 minutes to sprint from one side of the map to even the closest objective, so you typically want to spawn them within an armoured transport to get them closer to where they need to go, or a helicopter, if the risk of being shot down is worth the reward of the amount of time you save.</p>


<p>And that risk is very real. Even from the opening moments, fighter jets start zipping across the map to deal quick missile strikes on advancing tanks, then countered by surface-to-air missiles that see them spew decoy flares to try and make an escape. Once that SAM has fired, it’s then in a known spot, which makes it a ripe target for artillery and surface missile fire, which in turns reveals fresh targets for fighter jets. Each time you peel back the fog of war to fire off a barrage, it brings the risk of a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use that fog of war to your advantage. I spent the latter stages of my first battle building up an infantry assault force, moving them through the woods and holding station until the final minutes of the battle, where I could rush a lightly defended control point (alongside a rather danger close missile strike) and capture it right with minimal risk of reprisals.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this for my second match, on a more watery map with an out-of-the-way control point, I then started to put my soldiers in choppers to avoid slower submersible vehicles being spotted and blown up, had a SAM for cover, and spread out soldiers with IGLA launchers handy to then hold the control point from any aerial assaults.</p>
<p>This was all for nought as the battle in the middle of the map went the other team’s way, and my efforts to push back onto the mainland docks were quickly rebuffed by a handful of defending units tucked up in buildings and woodland. Multiplayer battle play out through three phases, with points awarded for area control as well as casualties.</p>

<p>A much better way to get a handle on the game is to go through the initial training and single player missions, though. We had access to a pair of scenarios, one from each side, with an airbase assault and a mission to capture and hold a power station.</p>
<p>Both of them really highlight the need for good scouting and situational awareness. The runway capture mission starts with sending in airstrikes to clear air defences before paratroopers come in to secure a beachhead, but they quickly need airlifted reinforcements to stave off the counter attacks from bases further away on the map. The power station assault puts you more in the middle of a combined assault, giving you a handful of key units in a wider front and objectives that are built up with multiple buildings to provide great cover to tank-busting infantry, while the enemy counter offensives alternate between the two. It starts to get hairy as long range artillery comes to battery your positions and the tide gradually turns the screws against you through the mission.</p>
<p>While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game, there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leenzee and publisher 505 Games have announced the release date for upcoming China-set Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, and it's adding to what will already be a pretty stacked summer.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498319683381887449" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game will be launching on July 24th across PC and current-gen consoles. It joins the likes of shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-release-date" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>&nbsp;</em>and cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>.</p>

<p>As is customary for modern games, pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also get you some extra goodies. You'll receive two outfits, a new weapon, and a Glistening Mercury upgrade item if you place your order before the game's launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=NnNL2VC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=SwuDFnk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>lands in July. This guy, on the other hand, looks like he's landing a lot sooner than that.</figcaption></figure><p>A Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also be available, and it'll net you four more outfits and four weapons, as well as a Blood of Changhong skill upgrade item. Of course, you'll be able to obtain plenty of those items throughout your journey, but it's nice to have a headstart.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG set in the Shu kingdom during the late Ming dynasty. You'll play as the titular Wuchang, a pirate "struck by amnesia" who must contend both with her uncertain past and a horrific disease known as the Feathering.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll face "grotesque abominations", explore "forgotten temples" and "overgrown ruins", and "piece together Wuchang's lost memories". It all sounds pretty much par for the course when it comes to Soulslikes.</p>

<p>You can check out a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, which shows off a rather unsettling boss by the name of the Perfect Bride, right here.</p>




<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9nprhd8gqkqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th. It'll also be available as part of a Game Pass subscription if you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

            <p>
I never played enough of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> to be seriously annoyed by its infamous level scaling system, but I gather from the anguished recollections of colleagues that it was like having a fistfight with a mirror. You'd pour all that blood and sweat into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s obtuse skill-massaging systems, and the simulation would toughen up in response, with hitherto modest bandits showing up garbed in armour and items that matched your capabilities. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's probably a life lesson in this. Something about, you know, not trying. Something about accepting that "progression" is a joke, that all our of feats are dust in Creation's compound eye, that we neither deserve nor are capable of change. Oh wait, hang on, the level scaling was a massive error of judgement! So sayeth original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith, speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/">Videogamer</a>, which invites the question: why haven't they gotten rid of it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>?
</p>
<p>
As Nesmith notes in the interview, the Remastered version's creators have made some significant adjustments to how you gain levels. Instead of improving major skills and then sleeping to boost your attributes, depending on said major skills, the new version of the RPG doles out XP per skill-up and lets you pick which attributes to improve.
</p>
<p>
"They actually went ahead and changed the game design underneath... some of the systems design," Nesmith commented. "That's pretty much unheard of in a remaster because the whole idea is that they want that old experience, so I consider that to be a very brave thing and probably help the Oblivion remaster to be significantly more popular - assuming they have done what they said and bring it to a more modern understanding of things, that's going to make the game more playable for modern sensibilities". 
</p>
<p>
So why is level scaling still in then? Today's kids are going to hate it, Bethesda, because they are, after all, kids. They still harbour the hope that they will someday amount to something, that there will be a measurable distance between what they are and how they began. 
</p>
<p>
Nesmith is as confused and horrified as you are, reader. "I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems," he told the site. "The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I'm intimately familiar with how both of those things work."
</p>
<p>
"I think the world levelling with you was a mistake and that's proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>," he went on. "That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like 'oh, it doesn't matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me"."
</p>
<p>
Are you an Oblivion survivor? I'm interested to read your doubtless seasoned thoughts about whether the level scaling system could be salvaged or improved somehow, rather than simply removed. I don't know whether it's been rejigged at all for the remaster - we've got somebody working on a longer assessment - but modders have already stepped in and stripped the fittings. Take this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">Unlevelled Item Rewards mod</a> from trainwiz, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> homage <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/underspace">Underspace</a> and also, the person largely responsible for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-the-scariest-skyrim-mod-ive-ever-seen">Skyrim's plague of Really Useful Engines</a>.
