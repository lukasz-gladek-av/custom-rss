            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-story-trailer-shows-off-snippets-of-noisy-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind have shared a new trailer (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC2rNzzmhXw">IGN</a>) for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, their horror game based off the popular film franchise. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead – Official First Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC2rNzzmhXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, there’s a snippet of incident from Day One of the alien monster invasion, setting up the relationship between protagonist Alex, an asthmatic college student, and her boyfriend Martin. We then skip ahead to Day 105, with Martin and Alex exploring the devastated world looking to scavenge from a house that mysteriously still has power.</p>
<p>There’s some nice touches here like using basic hand and head communication to direct one another, messages saying not to scream even in the “safe” room, and we see how opening doors works – you latch on and then can move it open slowly before releasing. Unfortunately it seems that the world was also in the grip of a fictional shortage of WD40 and oil-based lubricants, and North America in the very real shortage of decent sex education, because all of the hinges in the world are very creaky and Alex is very, very pregnant. That’s not good because things related to babies and baby making are famously not quiet.</p>
<p>Other things that aren’t noisy? Cars, shotguns and alarms.&nbsp;Oh dear…</p>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. This looks to be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game, though the trailer clearly plucked out some of the more action-y moments that put the Quiet Place monsters in frame. I’d expect the overarching pacing to be much more considered and slower paced, though.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is set to release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-a-musical-indie-game-went-against-the-grain-to-explore-the-deaf-experience.917970/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24190846/harmonium-the-musical-developer-interview-deaf-culture-experience<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Before I even touched the demo of <em>Harmonium: The Musical</em> at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, I started bawling. It’s about a young deaf girl, Melody, who wishes to participate in the musical traditions of her hearing family. That desire leads her to an adventure in the magical land of Harmonium where music and sign language are the primary means of communication. But what really got me about this game is the dedication from its development team to not only make this game but make it <em>right</em> — with all of the costs and risks that entails.</p><p><em>Harmonium</em> is the latest project from <a href="https://www.theoddgentlemen.com/">The Odd Gentlemen</a>, an LA-based studio known for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/6/8160509/kings-quest-remake-2015-gdc-pc-xbox-ps4">revival of the Sierra Entertainment point-and-click adventure classic <em>King’s Quest</em></a>. Studio founder Matt Korba told <em>The Verge</em> that <em>Harmonium</em> was inspired by theater troupes like <a href="https://www.deafwest.org/">Deaf West</a> that incorporate sign language into their productions. But in developing <em>Harmonium</em>, Korba said he wanted a game that went beyond what he felt most studios do when tackling representation. “Usually on projects like this, the script will be written in English, and [developers will hire] a consultant at the last minute that knows sign language, and they’ll just translate,” Korba said.&nbsp;</p><p>To Korba, <em>Harmonium</em> required a “ground-up approach” that, from day one, integrated the people with the same lived experiences as the characters created for the game. That included engaging the Southern California Association for the Deaf and recruiting deaf developers and artists. This led Korba to Matt Daigle, a deaf artist, performer, and graphic designer notable for creating the international symbol for breastfeeding and his webcomic <a href="https://handsail.net/home-tdg/"><em>That Deaf Guy</em></a> depicting the everyday life of a mixed-hearing family. He also found Søren Bro Sparre, a deaf animator from Denmark whose hiring introduced the challenge of communicating not only in English and American Sign Language but in Danish Sign Language as well.</p><p>For Daigle, <em>Harmonium</em> is a way to share more of Deaf culture, including dispelling what he called the cultural myth that music isn’t for deaf people. “I relate to Melody because I grew up in a family of musicians, and I played the clarinet,” Daigle signed in our interview with helpful translation from his interpreter. “It’s good to show that a person who was hearing who became deaf can still enjoy music, and that deaf people enjoy everything in their own way.”</p><div><p>“It’s good to show that a person who was hearing who became deaf can still enjoy music, and that deaf people enjoy everything in their own way.”</p></div><p>Though Daigle’s role was to inform Melody as a deaf character, there were other elements of her character that he could not speak to. Melody is Filipino, Korba explained, and her experiences as a person are influenced by her cultural heritage as well as her deafness.</p><p>“As we got deeper into development, we realized there was a cross-cultural difference,” Korba said. “We had to laser focus and try to find people with lived experience and the [right] background, so we ended up finding two actresses who are both deaf and Filipino that we use for reference accuracy.”</p><p>That level of specificity took work; the game’s story had to be rewritten three times. But Korba also explained that all those little steps taken in service to authenticity made the game better than what it would have been without it.</p><p>“One of our early passes on the script had a lot of deaf struggles in it,” Korba said. Originally, Melody’s father wasn’t going to use sign language, emulating a common problem between deaf children and their hearing parents. But in testing this story with deaf participants, they found that despite the fact this was a common scenario for deaf people, they rejected it anyway, telling the developer that “I don’t want to see that in a video game.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Melody signs with her father, who, in the original script, did not use sign language.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: The Odd Gentlemen</cite></p></div><p>He said their deaf playtesters explained that they didn’t want their children to grow up expecting to always struggle with their hearing loved ones. “We discovered it’s okay to show challenges, but you also have to show the benefits.”</p><p>That benefit is something Daigle explained as “Deaf Gain” — a philosophy that shifts the perspective on deaf people to the unique things they can do versus what they can’t. “This is about people speaking with their eyes,” Daigle signed. In the opening moments of <em>Harmonium</em>’s demo, for instance, Melody is stuck inside practicing for a recital when her friend stops by to speak to her through her living room window — something only deaf people can do.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Melody’s deaf friend Matt communicates with her through a window.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: The Odd Gentlemen</cite></p></div><p>Hearing about all the things it took to bring <em>Harmonium </em>to life, I couldn’t help but wonder: “Isn’t this all prohibitively expensive?” Game development is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009903/the-cost-of-aaa-development-is-too-damn-high">time-consuming and expensive as it is</a>, even without <em>Harmonium</em>’s level of specificity. Expensive games that take a long time to make face a significant challenge to recoup that cost and make a profit. And even then, merely being profitable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">isn’t enough to ensure a studio’s survival</a>.</p><p>Daigle and Korba credited their partners at Xbox and Netflix who encouraged their team to continue down their unique, if complicated, path even though it ran contrary to modern game development sensibilities. “We have had time to let those things incubate and develop, bringing them to an audience that includes everybody,” Daigle signed. “Does that sound expensive? It sure is. But it’s worth it.”</p><div><p>The video game industry has been beset with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">unprecedented layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations</a>. Publishers are largely choosing to spend money on developing massive, live-service, multiplayer, multi-platform games from recognizable IPs, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-game-industry-is-fed-indie-devs-are-dying-off-because-getting-funding-is-a-battlefield-right-now-even-for-critically-acclaimed-veterans/">leaving smaller studios and games to languish for lack of funding</a>. Meanwhile, underneath it all is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">a vigorous and virulent current of toxicity</a> that seeks to amplify the fringe notion that in order for the video games industry to survive this upheaval, they must appeal to as broad an audience as possible.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>“Does that sound expensive? It sure is. But it’s worth it.”</p></div><p>Given all this, it feels like a miracle a game like <em>Harmonium</em> exists — and its developers know it.&nbsp;“We all just did it one step at a time,” Korba said. “And everyone’s like, ‘How did you get here?’ I don’t really know.”</p><p><em>Harmonium </em>is but one example of how diversity and inclusion combined with authentically and empathetically executed scope results <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24135151/hades-2-technical-test-impressions">in</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">better</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">games</a> — the kind audiences will embrace.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not deaf or Filipino, but I could still connect with Melody and her story. I grinned like an idiot when I solved one of <em>Harmonium</em>’s puzzles, matching Melody’s signed descriptions to their correct instruments so I could open a locked door. I laughed when Daigle explained some of the Deaf humor in the game, like a joke about a deaf tree that wouldn’t fall unless someone signed “timber.” And it all made me cry because even though it would have been easier, cheaper, and safer for the developers at The Odd Gentlemen to not include any of these things, they did it anyway.</p><p>“We’re not just building a game for deaf people,” Daigle signed, “but a game that is fun and engaging for everybody.”</p><p><small><em>Harmonium: The Musical</em> launches in early 2025 on Netflix and Xbox Game Pass.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throughout the past 24 hours, several people have taken to social media to announce that they have faced layoffs at Microsoft.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear the exact number of those affected or if they’re part of the 1500 estimated to be laid off in June. Insider Gaming has found four people announcing their departure from the company.</p>



<p>Angela Viness, a Senior Product Manager at Microsoft <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213952816183222272/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>, “Hello friends –&nbsp; In light of the recent layoffs at Microsoft, my position was eliminated, and I am now on the lookout for my next career adventure. It was an incredible ride and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunities I was given.”</p>



<p>While Jessabirdy on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/Jessabirdy/status/1808238301062877612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Sad to announce that my role with Microsoft has been eliminated. To all those who have been a part of Team Xbox. Thank you. Hope I made you proud. &lt;3”</p>



<p>Cory Ebert, a Technical Program Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213966580261486592/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Well, this isn’t how I thought today would go. After nearly 15 years (seriously, two months shy), Microsoft has made the decision to end our working relationship effective immediately due to changes in the business direction and landscape.”</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>

Most of the features are already locked in, as well as the story. We highly doubt things will change much from this initial description though we never know… There’s always something we can get rid of to ship it within this lifetime.</p><p><strong>Release When?</strong></p><p>No idea. I don’t wanna give any time tables here as to not repeat a <em>N1RV Ann-A</em> situation (though we do have an internal one), but we hope it’s sooner rather than later. I was actually gonna wait until we had the entire game built before announcing it Officially, but selling games has become much harder. It’s not 2016 anymore, so if we want this game to have a chance we gotta start now and hoard those wishlists and shit.</p><p>In short: when it’s done.</p><p>Do expect monthly devlogs (I’ve been writing them for years now, though I’ve been behind for Very Good Reasons), and progress shots over at my Twitter account and Sukeban’s.</p><p><strong><em>N1RV Ann-A</em>?</strong></p><p>No news in that front. Sorry. I know that’s the main event everyone wants to see, but <em>.45 PARABELLUM BLOODHOUND</em> is significantly ahead in development, and I decided to dedicate my full attention to it for the foreseeable future.

Merengedoll (of <em>VA-11 Hall-A</em> kids! fame), always the soldier, has been helping me out with character, enemy, boss and production design. Juneji (also from <em>VA-11 Hall-A</em> kids!) is doing the soundtrack and some 3D work; and for the first time ever we have someone managing our asses to move things forward at a nice pace.</p><p>If you’re familiar with my solo outing then you kinda know what to expect in terms of vibes and story; for better and for worse.</p><p><strong>Stray Notes</strong></p><ul><li>Spanish, English and Japanese localizations are being planned for day one (hoping for more, but these three are the ones within our current bandwidth).</li><li>No downloadable demo planned as maintaining a separate build will probably drive us crazy.</li><li>After a couple reboots the current incarnation of the project has been under development for roughly two years, but if we wanna get cheeky, me and the programmer have been talking about doing something like this since high school. It really makes you think.</li><li><em>VA-11 Hall-A</em>, when it came to my contributions to its visuals and atmosphere, was very much a pastiche of inspirations both subtle and in-your-face. This time around I’ve been trying to isolate my brain from external influences as much as possible outside of the initial spark for the battle system and other mechanics. Games take a lot of work to make, so I’d like to deliver a uniquely “Sukeban” experience; whatever it may entail.</li></ul><p><strong>For Those in Japan: Play It at Bitsummit Drift!</strong></p><p>Lucky people in the Kyoto area can get a taste of the game’s first chapter at this year’s BitSummit Drift.

I draw on my experience as a game designer, lead designer, and trainer.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To be or not to be …">To be or not to be …</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If there is one aspect that differentiates veterans from novices, it is mastery of soft skills. What is it about?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Soft skills correspond to an individual's personal qualities and behaviors within a team. Called soft skills in English, they become more and more important when recruiting a future member of a development team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You will easily find generalities on essential skills in the studio, such as being a team player, respecting requests to the letter, or being very demanding regarding your own work. But today, I would like to share with you other very concrete soft skills that are the fruit of my 28 years of experience as a game designer.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 1 - Always follow the implementation of your design">Soft skills 1 - Always follow the implementation of your design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just because you have written a design document does not mean it will be developed to the letter. The reasons may be multiple: The programmer or artist may misunderstand your design intentions and not ask you for an explanation, a technical requirement may prevent its implementation exactly as you envisioned, your design document may be missing of clarity, or quite simply, not to be read! I have personally experienced all of these situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In such circumstances, your most conscientious colleagues will ask you questions or seek instructions, but not all will do so. It is, therefore, your responsibility to ensure that your design is correctly understood and implemented. Never forget that you will be blamed if the gameplay is mediocre, not the team members who put it in place, even if they did not respect your specifications!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Good practices">Good practices</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid this type of problem, the best practices are as follows:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Write design documents that are as precise as possible AND easy to read</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't develop a huge design document; no one will read it. Instead, write several design documents, each focused on a game experience, and implement them one after the other.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don’t just send your design documents to the appropriate team members; present the main lines of your design to them orally and with diagrams.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Check that the functionality developed corresponds to what you have defined</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spend a lot of time testing, testing, and testing the game again.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To illustrate my point, I will share situations I have witnessed or experienced with you. Of course, the names are fictitious to preserve each person's anonymity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Luigi is a game designer for an action-adventure game in which the main character is accompanied by a teammate. He designs the mechanics that manage the teammate's behavior, the places he goes, the attitude he adopts, and the actions he takes. This mechanic is based on the positioning of waypoints by the level design team.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Luigi simply wrote a detailed design document and trusted the rest of the team to correctly implement his design.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But the artistic team goes after the level designer and modifies the map's topology: Certain passage points are found under the ground or hidden by added decorative elements.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>As a result, the functionality works poorly, and the gameplay seems inconsistent. Luigi doesn't realize what happened because he doesn't spend enough time testing the new content. Poorly highlighted, the functionality is ultimately abandoned.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 2 - Prepare intelligently for the meetings to which you are invited">Soft skills 2 - Prepare intelligently for the meetings to which you are invited</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If a meeting is well organized, it has an agenda and a list of topics to be discussed. If you are invited to a meeting, it is because your contribution is considered valuable. Your ideas and opinions are, therefore, expected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If, during the meeting, a subject is put on the table and you have not had time to think about it beforehand, your contribution will be superficial or even counterproductive. You risk coming across as someone who “counts for nothing”, a simple performer who brings no added value. And if you improvise a response to show presence, you risk saying something without any point, something which will ultimately tarnish your image.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Good practices">Good practices</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you are invited to a meeting, here are the best practices to follow:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Read the meeting agenda carefully. If there is none, ask the meeting organizer to specify the topics that will be covered; you will then be able to prepare yourself and give yourself the image of a good professional.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take some time to think about the themes that will be covered, and that fall within your expertise. The simple fact of thinking with a clear head will allow you to make more relevant proposals but, above all to construct an argument to defend them.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here is a new illustration of what to do...and not to do:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>John is invited to a meeting organized by the project's creative director. Other game designers will also be present. The agenda specifies that we will discuss a feature in the game that is not satisfactory: cooperative action between two players from the same side.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>When the creative director puts the subject on the table and asks the game designers present for their opinion, John, who has not really thought about the problem, is uncomfortable and settles for a very general proposal. But Emma, the other game designer, makes another proposal and illustrates it with a diagram. A drawing is much more understandable than a speech, and she reinforces her proposition by citing games that use the solution she proposes.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>John weakened his position on the team, while Emma emerged as making a better contribution to the project. His solution is chosen not because it is better but because it is presented in a more convincing manner.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 3 - Be humble and open to changes">Soft skills 3 - Be humble and open to changes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game designer is always attached to his work to his ideas. It's normal. But a game mechanic remains a mere figment; we can never be sure of its interest until it has been developed and integrated into the game. In other words, an idea may seem very good on paper but may turn out to be disappointing once implemented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This situation is common.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, the quality of the player's experience results from the interaction between many aspects of the game: its mechanics, settings, rhythm, the player's objectives, complexity, etc. A mechanic can effectively contribute to a quality experience in one game but be detrimental in another.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therefore, a game designer must demonstrate modesty and develop a spirit of self-criticism. He must objectively analyze the relevance of his design choices. He must listen to the opinions of other members of his team. Above all, he must take into account the feedback from the playtests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therefore, he must be ready to start from scratch if a game mechanic is not satisfactory. Experience shows that if a game mechanic does not work, simple improvements may not be enough; it is often preferable to start again with a new mechanism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some young game designers tend to defend their ideas against all odds; they make it a personal matter. They are wrong. Their interest is that their name is associated with a published and effective game rather than their ideas being retained in a mediocre or never-published one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Common sense advice? This is not the case for everyone. Here is a new illustration of the consequences when a designer persists in defending “his” vision of the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Igor is the lead-level designer on a multiplayer game for home consoles. The first playtests, carried out with players from outside the studio and representatives of the targeted audience, validate the game mechanics but point out problems in the maps: They are too large in relation to the number of players, the latter get lost easily, and they have too many bottlenecks.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The playtest sessions follow one another. Each session comprises players who have never played the game and all report the same problems related to level design. The problems cited by the playtesters are nevertheless systematically reported to Igor after each playtest session, but the modifications made to the maps are minor and do not change the feedback from the playtesters.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>After several months, faced with Igor's reluctance to fundamentally change the maps, the studio management removed him from his position and replaced him with another team member.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To be continued …">To be continued …</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next part of this publication, I will discuss the other essential skills, in my eyes, for a game or level designer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pascal Luban</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game designer &amp; creative director, freelance</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">28+ years of experience serving game developers and publishers</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedesignstudio.com/">www.gamedesignstudio.com</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photo credit: Poca Wander Stock</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Blogger</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pascal Luban is a freelance creative director and game designer based in France.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spy-drops-is-randomly-generated-metal-gear-solid-for-the-modern-era.917931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spy-drops-metal-gear-stealth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rainy Frog and solo developer Rainy Night Creations have announced&nbsp;<em>Spy Drops</em>, a 3D stealth-action roguelite very heavily inspired by late-90s stealth classics like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Syphon Filter</em>.</p>
<p><em>Spy Drops&nbsp;</em>casts you as a member of the titular Spy Drops team, a counter-terrorist organization dispatched to prevent an "eco-terrorist organization" from "wiping out all digital records and sending the world back to the Stone Age".</p>
<p>In true&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>fashion, however, what begins as a simple mission quickly becomes more complex, and it's not long before you're questioning your mission objectives and "uncover[ing] a deeper conspiracy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spy-drops-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=Q2h33Uxt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spy-drops-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=55xDk-BB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Spy Drops&nbsp;</em>isn't shy about its&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>influence.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise, if you've played&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Spy Drops</em>; it's a pseudo-top-down 3D stealth-action game with an emphasis on remaining undetected and using non-lethal methods to deal with guards.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Metal Gear</i>, however,&nbsp;<em>Spy Drops</em>' levels are randomly-generated, which strikes me as a bit of a shame; one of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>'s strengths was its iconic level design, so it seems a bit sad to throw that aspect of the game away.</p>
<p>Still, Rainy Frog says randomized missions guarantee a "tense gameplay experience", as you don't know what awaits you around each corner, ensuring that each player's "game will be different". Hmm. I'm not sure how true that is in practise.</p>
<p>To complete your mission, you'll have access to a host of gadgets, including drones, night vision goggles, mine detectors, and more, and you'll be able to take a variety of approaches to each mission as well.</p>

<p>As a huge&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>fan, I've got my eye on this one, although I'm slightly troubled by the disclaimer on the Steam page that the developer has used generative AI "for dialogues (audio) and icons". Yuck.</p>
<p><em>Spy Drops&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does arrive, it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3034070/Spy_Drops/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch. Watch this space for more info.</p>

            <p>The bundle building team at Humble has detailed the games included in July's Choice bundle, with A Plague Tale: Requiem being a highlight.</p>

<p>This month's selection of eight games are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Plague Tale: Requiem</li>

<p>As with previous months, five percent of Choice membership will go towards charitable causes.</p>
<p>This month, Humble is supporting Covenant House, which is "dedicated to supporting young people facing homelessness and survivors of trafficking through unconditional love, absolute respect, and relentless support, in 34 cities across six countries". You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjsV5BvoJPc">find out more about what Covenant House does here</a>.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, A Plague Tale: Requiem (pictured above) is an incredibly emotional stealth action adventure, set in 14th century France.</p>
<p>Our Bertie called it a "brutal, spectacular adventure of love and sacrifice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-plague-tale-requiem-review-a-brutal-spectacular-adventure-of-love-and-sacrifice">Eurogamer's A Plague Tale: Requiem review</a>. "Requiem, simply put, is one of the finest adventures around," he wrote in 2022.</p>
<p>Ghostrunner 2 (pictured below), meanwhile, is a first-person slasher from One More Level. Bertie also gave the Ghostrunner sequel a whirl on its release, having been a big fan of the original.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, everything I like about the original is back. It's got the moves, it's got the sounds, it's got that garish cyberpunk cool, and it's got pace... Great," he wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-134">after a few hours with Ghostrunner 2</a>. </p>
<p>"But on the other hand, it has a lot more stuff," Bertie continued, adding things such as the story "makes it all seem a bit messy and convoluted".

			<p>Ever since Rare was acquired by Microsoft in 2002, fans have been pining for the revival of its trademark IPs, such as Conker and Banjo-Kazooie.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Xbox did attempt to do something with those franchises in the first few years since the acquisition. Rare released Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded (featuring a remake of the original installment Conker: Bad Fur Day) on the original Xbox in 2005, while Banjo-Kazooie fans had to wait until 2008, when Rare released the brand new Nuts &amp; Bolts game for the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>However, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts largely diverged from previous games in the platform franchise. Its gameplay was more focused on vehicle construction (which was excellent for the time, powered by Havok physics) rather than traditional platforming. The game's focus on building/crafting was certainly way ahead of its time, and it didn't sell nearly as well as Microsoft and Rare had hoped.</p>
<p>To this day, Nuts &amp; Bolts remains the latest entry in the series. It has been repackaged in Rare's Replay, released in 2015 for the UK studio's 30th anniversary, but there's been no more solace for Banjo-Kazooie fans from Rare, unless you count the Bear &amp; Bird Figurehead <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-sea-of-thieves-update-1-1-5-banjo-kazooie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> a few years ago in Sea of Thieves. Thankfully, a few ex-Rare developers founded Playtonic and created a fairly successful spiritual successor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yooka-laylee-on-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yooka-Laylee</a>, which is now getting a remaster called Yooka-Replaylee with improved art, animations, moveset, camera, controls, and soundtrack.</p>
<p>But are Rare and/or Microsoft planning to do anything with Banjo-Kazooie? According to Windows Central's Jez Corden, absolutely not. Speaking on the subject <a href="https://youtu.be/EbOmQqPNpsU?si=ZnxwFb-YbmGdU5qq&amp;t=1246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the latest XB2+1 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I can tell you right now, categorically, there is no Banjo game in development. As of the recording of this podcast, there is no Banjo game in development.</em></p>
<p>Rare is certainly busy with the continued support of Sea of Thieves, especially following the launch on PlayStation, and with the development of Everwild, which remains a mystery. Microsoft would have to choose an external partner to make a game based on the IP.</p>
<p>Would you like to see the dynamic duo return in some capacity, or should they be left in the past?</p>

            <p>You might have seen that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-were-all-spending-our-last-tenner-on-the-best-deals-in-the-steam-summer-sale">£10 will go a long way in the Steam summer sale</a>, but let me do you one better. Indie game store Itch.io has begun <a href="https://itch.io/sales">its own summer sale</a>, and for those willing to delve into its rainbow-coloured heap of throwaway toys and fun experiments, plenty of deals await.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The sale starts today and ends July 12th. There are quite a few tasty nuggets deep in the creases of this bargainous sofa. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turnip-boy-commits-tax-evasion">Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion</a> sees a <a href="https://graffiti-games.itch.io/tbcte">hefty price slash</a><a></a>. Surreal JRPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hylics">Hylics</a> gets <a href="https://mason-lindroth.itch.io/hylics">the same</a>. Comedy browser censorship sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> has <a href="https://jay-tholen.itch.io/hypnospace-outlaw">a chunky discount</a>. Architecturally unnerving refugee simulation <a href="https://gabriel-helfenstein.itch.io/north">North</a> has a <a href="https://gabriel-helfenstein.itch.io/north">big price cut</a>. And mildly unsettling Zelda-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> is also <a href="https://han-tani.itch.io/anodyne">going cheap</a>. Yes, some of these are also currently discounted on Steam too, but I know some of you loathe Valve enough to never set digi-foot in their digi-mart. So this is a good alternative, a local car boot sale that will probably see creators get more money per sale. </p>
<p>Aside from games, Itch has also long been a good place for hobbyist developers to pick up <a href="https://itch.io/game-assets/on-sale">assets</a> and ultra-specific tools for game development. The bright <a href="https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad">low poly modeling tool PicoCAD</a> is on sale, for example, and so is chiptune music maker <a href="https://1oogames.itch.io/lovely-composer">Lovely Composer</a>. </p>
<p>One little tip: if you see nothing but sex games when you log into Itch, that's no surprise. Like Steam, it's a wild west of boobs in there. This can make it hard to find the stuff you're after. To hide the hodgepodge of horniness you can go to your <a href="https://itch.io/user/settings">user settings</a> and untick a box that says "Show content marked as adult in search &amp; browse". Or don't, I'm not judging. Some of that stuff is on sale too.</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs this January</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio closures in May</a>, Microsoft is cutting more Xbox jobs this week, the Verge's Tom Warren has claimed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox's Jessie Thomas announced on X that her role at Microsoft was "eliminated". After this post on X, Tom Warren responded that more Xbox layoffs will be happening this week. While many suspected that it was just Thomas&nbsp;that was let go, Warren has now clarified that more individuals at Xbox will be losing their jobs. "more Xbox layoffs happening this week", Warren <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1808346995473433069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> some hours ago. "Microsoft laid off Jessie while she was on vacation". For those in the unknown, Thomas has been with Microsoft since 2015, and served as&nbsp;Senior Business PM of Culture Programs as of 2022.</p>
<p>An hour ago, The Verge reporter <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1808446740200149347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a>, "as per my tweet, it’s not just one person".</p>
<p>While we haven't seen messages from other Microsoft/Xbox employees having been laid off today or earlier this week, it's likely that we'll be hearing more in the coming days. As always, we'll update you as soon as we learn more about this matter.</p>
<p>Earlier today we already reported that&nbsp;Tales of Kenzera ZAU Developer Surgent Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-surgent-studios-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was hit by layoffs as well</a>. According to the studio, a dozen of people had to be let go.</p>
<p>Following the massive wave of layoffs at Microsoft this January, Microsoft announced the closure of three Xbox studios this May - affected studios included Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin and several other Bethesda Softworks studios. After the announced studio closures, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-will-cut-more-jobs-arkane-tango-pitching-new-projects-before-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported that its expected that Xbox will be cutting more jobs</a>. Games Industry Analyst Rhys Elliott from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research</a> suggested that Xbox is refocusing on something more bigger. <em>"Xbox, despite its smart PR over the past years, likely sees these studio closures as a ‘’you need to break a few eggs to make an omelet’’ kind of situation" </em>he said back in May<em>. "It is a massive shame that those eggs are some of the most talented developers in the industry, and now their lives have been uprooted. "</em></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree introduced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-thrusting-shield-locations">Thrusting Shields</a> as a new weapon type, but some players believe they're overpowered to the point of being "absolutely busted".
</p>
<p>
You may have spotted in the DLC's gameplay trailer the player character leaping through the air with a spiked shield. This is one of many new weapon types, with two shields to choose from: the Dueling Shield and Carian Thrusting Shield.
</p>
<p>
Both shields have the Shield Strike skill that uses the shield to attack. And if attacking and blocking at the same time seems overpowered, well it is.

<p>

"New Thrusting shields are the strongest weapons in the entire game and it's not even close," wrote DamnHare on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dtks1t/new_thrusting_shields_are_the_strongest_weapons/">Elden Ring subreddit</a>. "NG+ DLC was absolutely obliterated. Thrusting shields can be enchanted with any affinity/damage type that makes them extremely versatile. And it's just so much fun to slap the grace out of every single boss!"
</p>
<p>
Many others agree. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-players-are-sleepwalking-through-bossfights-with-the-dlcs-silly-pointy-shields/">PC Gamer</a> points out, the shields can be modified with any damage type and scaling and work particularly well with certain talismans like the Spear Talisman for extra counterattack damage, and the Two-Handed Sword Talisman for a two-handed damage boost.
</p>
<p>
You can also throw in the Sekiro-esque Deflecting Hardtear too to strengthen guard counters and voila, the ultimate tank build!
</p>
<p>
One response to DamnHare's post claimed the Thrusting Shields are "absolutely busted" and how that player beat the final boss. "Being able to guard counter to break poise while not worrying about timing and only taking chip damage is insane. Being able to just spam attacks and tank through everything only taking chip damage is insane," said Drstrangelove899. "The stamina drain from attacking through attack seems really minimal even against massive boss attacks. And its damage is really good as well, especially as its attacks are considered thrust and benefit from the spear talisman."
</p>
<p>
Here's Japanese X user pirochanbanzai showing just how effective this build can be.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE0FmjAPc8g">YouTuber Larry Puss</a> has also put together a video of the build, explaining how it just requires players to spam two buttons (beware of boss spoilers in the video).

</p>
<p>
Of course, some players will prefer a different fighting style and may consider these tactics as cheap. But if you're struggling with bosses, you could consider changing your build to this. At the least, it's amusing how Soulsborne games have slowly moved away from tank builds only to find shields might just be the strongest weapons in Elden Ring after all.
</p>
<p>
It's also your cue to change up your weapon tactics from the base game and try one of the new weapon types. I, for one, have slapped bleed on the Dryleaf Arts to pummel dragons in the face - it's a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>
Many Shadow of the Erdtree players criticised the DLC for being too difficult and the game received a negative rating on Steam for this and performance issues. However, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-has-recovered-to-a-mostly-positive-steam-rating">since turned this around and now has a "Mostly Positive" response</a>.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will let you escape death entirely as part of its extensive difficulty customisation options, which will also let you manually adjust player and enemy health.
</p>
<p>
As detailed to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay">Game Informer</a>, BioWare has included a range of set difficulty levels and a further option that offers more granular customisation of your play experience. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's base levels are named Storyteller, Adventurer and Nightmare - the latter of which is a permanent choice, while the former options can be flitted between. There's also a further option, Unbound, which offers difficulty editing on the fly.

<p>
Unbound options include enabling aim assistance or auto-aim if you so choose, adjusting the difficulty of parrying enemy attacks, upping your own damage output, and even tweaking the general health pools of enemies and how much they'll press you in combat. Finally, there's an option to disable death entirely, so you'll never see a Game Over screen. 
</p>
<p>
"[None of these options] are a cheat," game director Corinne Busche told Game Informer. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."  
</p>
<p>
BioWare lifted the lid on Dragon Age: The Veilguard last month after years in development. There's still no launch date, but the suggestion seems to be that the long-awaited role-playing game is now very close to release.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer went hands-on with the game last month, and came away thoroughly impressed. "Whisper it, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable</a>: it looks like BioWare is back," our Chris Tapsell wrote.

<p>Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In short, Wuthering Waves’ 1.1 update seemingly altered said anti-cheat in such a way that enabled the game to launch on Linux-based operating systems, including the Deck’s SteamOS. Previously, it was possible to install the Windows version of the game launcher, but actually getting into the game itself proved impossible. Version 1.1 not only allowed the launcher to launch Wuthering Waves, but for the game to become fully playable, if by most accounts a bit slow on the Deck’s modest processing bits.</p>
<p>Still, before you could say "Absorption is only possible when your Data Bank’s level is equal to higher than the Tacet Discord’s level", or indeed understand whatever the fuck that means, a scary-looking "Anti-cheat system works error" message appeared to forcibly close Wuthering Waves back down. A follow-up update, it turns out, changed the game’s anti-cheat to again block out Linux devices. Only, after a few seconds of playing, as opposed to blocking the game launch entirely, which is a kind of progress? I guess?</p>

</figure>
<p>That brings us to the here and now, where Wuthering Waves can still launch on the Steam Deck, and might even provide a few moments of wandering around in-game, but from what I’ve tested it’s only a matter of seconds before the anti-cheat message arrives. There’s no overt threat of a ban (or any other punishment), but yeah, I wouldn’t risk pushing it even if you spent that single day of freedom with a smile.</p>
<p>I nonetheless feel compelled to keep an eye on this (and indeed, thanks to reader Scotty for the tip). While I’m not particularly keen to play more Wuthering Waves, on the Steam Deck or anything else, I’ve now pumped enough of my time into setup and launch attempts that this specific game/hardware combo has become the blubberiest of white whales. You think another solo-manned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-amazon-prime-day-pc-gaming-deals-2024">Prime Day</a> will kill me? Nah mate, it’ll be trying to trying to launch the magic waifus game on my handheld. Someone take over the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a> when I’m gone.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-september-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> developer Teyon is already recruiting for a new project, and it looks like the studio is planning to switch genres. The developer is known for making shooter games (they also released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/terminator-resistance-enhanced-new-paint-over-rusted-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terminator: Resistance</a>), but this time, they are making an action roleplaying game, as <a href="https://teyon.elevato.net/en/regularsenior-c-game-programmer,j,127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in a job offer.</p>
<p><em>Teyon is an experienced development studio with numerous titles to his credit. We employ over 100 employees, and apart from Krakow, we are also located in Łódź, Warsaw and even Tokyo.</em><br>
<em>Teyon is looking for talented people who will support us with their skills, knowledge, and ideas in our upcoming project. This new action RPG game for PC and console will be developed by the team responsible for our previous titles, Terminator: Resistance and RoboCop: Rogue City.</em></p>
<p>This job ad also reveals that the unannounced action RPG project is being backed by a 'major publisher'. Both RoboCop: Rogue City and Terminator: Resistance were published by Nacon, which, however, cannot really be considered a big publisher. As such, Teyon (an independent studio) may have partnered with some other company for this one.</p>
<p>Both Terminator: Resistance and RoboCop: Rogue City garnered acclaim from fans due to their faithful adaptation of the source material from the respective sci-fi franchises. The latter game, in particular, was hailed by Nacon as the publisher's biggest-ever launch, exceeding sales estimates.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-not-in-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-banjo-kazooie-is-not-in-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.917886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-not-in-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Over the last couple of years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-is-coming-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various claims have suggested</a> that a new Banjo Kazooie game has either been greenlit or in development. However, according to one reputable journalist and insider, that is simple not the case.</p>



<p>According to WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden in the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbOmQqPNpsU&amp;t=1246s&amp;ab_channel=JezC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XB2+1 podcast</a>, a new Banjo Kazooie is not in development. “I don’t know if never, but I can tell you right now, categorically, there is no Banjo game in development as of this podcast on the 26th of June 2024. There is no Banjo game in development right now.”</p>



<p>In the past, NateTheHate (under NateDrake on ResetEra) has made several claims that a Banjo Kazooie game has been greenlit and is in active development. In late 2023, he said, “It’s still an active project, but it didn’t get the green light until early last year.” He continued,&nbsp;“There is a lot to do, and development can change a lot (abandoned ideas, internal reboots, etc.).”</p>



<p>Banjo-Kazooie hasn’t seen a true main console entry since 2000’s Banjo-Tooie. There were a couple of handheld games in the early-mid 2000s — Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty’s Revenge and Banjo-Pilot for the Game Boy Advance. There was also Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts in 2008, but that game was such a deviation from the first two games, that it’s regarded more of a spin-off than anything else.</p>



<p>There seems to be a high demand for family-friendly games as of late, though. PlayStation’s Astro Bot “2” reveal saw tremendous traction online earlier this year, so we wouldn’t be surprised if Xbox is also floating around ideas on what they can do with its family-friendly IPs.</p>

Check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant review in progress</a> to find out what we think of the game so far.</p><p>But it’s the monetization that has sparked debate during the early days of The First Descendant’s launch, as well as issues giving players rewards they're owed that have forced Nexon into offering compensation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>Korean company Nexon, which is behind other multiplayer-focused free-to-play games such as Kartrider: Drift and Maplestory, launched The First Descendant with a packed cash shop that sells everything you’d expect from a game of this type: a premium battle pass, new characters, premium character and weapon skins, and even experience boosts and increased inventory capacity.</p><p>New characters, called Descendants, are sold for real-world money, but the premium virtual currency, Caliber, is sold in bundles that come in just under the cost of a new character itself, forcing players to buy more virtual currency than they need and, thus, having some left over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/screenshot-2024-07-03-101622-1719998219426.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The First Descendant has a premium currency sold for real-world money.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Caliber can only be obtained by buying it with real-world money or by buying the premium battle pass. There is currently no way to earn it through gameplay alone.</p><p>While you can grind (a lot) for new characters, you can save time by spending money to buy them. You can also pay to gain immediate access to an ‘Ultimate Descendant’, which is a Descendant with better stats and an exclusive skin. Expect to pay upwards of $55 for one.</p><p>The First Descendant also locks a paint to a skin, which means if you want to re-use a paint you’ve already obtained, perhaps from the premium battle pass, you have to spend real-world money on it again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Some players have called The First Descendant “predatory” because of its monetization, while others have said it’s par for the course when it comes to games from Nexon. On Steam, The First Descendant has a ‘mixed’ user review rating, with many of the negative reviews focusing on the microtransactions, but others are also delivering their verdict on the gunplay and mechanics. One Steam user called the First Descendant “microtransaction hell.” Another said: “This game released with more real money purchasable items than actual gameplay mechanics.”</p><p>Even those who have spent money on microtransactions are having a tough time, Nexon apologized to players who have yet to receive items they paid for by offering compensation. “We will continue to strive to provide a more stable service,” Nexon said.</p><p>Here are the compensation details:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gold Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</li><li>Kyper Shard Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</li><li>Descendant EXP Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</li><li>Weapon Mastery EXP Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</li><li>2 x Matte Red Paints</li></ul><p>Despite all this, The First Descendant hit a Steam concurrent player count of 229,257, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform. The game also launched on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, but Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers available.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>A Legend of Zelda fan has been sentenced to four months in prison, after being found in possession of a small replica of the series' Master Sword whilst out in public.</p>
<p>In June, Nuneaton resident Anthony Bray was arrested for "carrying a bladed article". CCTV operators noticed Bray with the Master Sword replica, which had a total blade length of six inches (see images below).</p>
<p>"The blade was inside a sheath and could be released from the sheath with the press of a button," reads the <a href="https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/news/warwickshire/news/2024/july/anthony-bray-sentenced-to-four-months-for-possession-of-replica-master-sword/">police press release</a>.</p>

<p>When questioned, Bray said the Master Sword replica was purchased online as a fidget toy. Officers explained that despite this being the intended purpose, the blade "was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them".</p>
<p>Bray maintained he would not have used the Legend of Zelda sword replica as an actual weapon. Bray did, however, acknowledge it could have been perceived as threatening.</p>

</figure>
<p>"We take a zero tolerance to bladed articles in public, and Bray has fallen afoul of this," said Sgt Spellman of the Patrol Investigations Unit. "It is possible to find fidget toys that aren't six-inch blades. It is possible not to walk down the street holding them out in front of you.</p>
<p>"With a bit more self-awareness, Bray could have avoided contact with us completely."</p>
<p>Bray is now required to pay a victims' surcharge of £154 in addition to serving the aforementioned prison sentence.</p>

            <p>Nexon's free-to-play looter-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> - "Nexon's Warframe", as the wags are calling it on Steam - launched this week and has <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2594639?headlineId=1015">encountered a few snags and snaffaroos</a>, including beta rewards not showing up, Easy Anti-Cheat not running correctly, frame-rate drops for people who downloaded in advance of release, and players finding their merry way to servers where no other players exist. Nexon are even now patching the game, and have plied players with in-game bonuses and cosmetics as an apology for the inconvenience.</p><!--more-->
<p>The bonuses basically consist of being able to level up faster and paint your guns red. Here's the rundown.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Gold Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</p>
<p>- Kyper Shard Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</p>
<p>- Descendant EXP Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</p>
<p>- Weapon Mastery EXP Gain Boost +30% (Duration 3 days)</p>
<p>- 2 x Matte Red Paints</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These boost items will activate immediately upon your claiming them from the mailbox, so you might want to save them for a happier time when you understand what the hell a Kyper Shard is. For context, The First Descendant pits you and up to three friends equipped with sci-firearms and accessories such as grappling hooks against the snobby alien Vulgus and a bunch of cursed war golems called Colossi. The latter are after the Ironheart, a mystic energy source said to lie somewhere on your home planet, Ingris. It sounds like Kyper Shards will help with all that. I think the red paint is more of a fashion thing.</p>
<p>All the talk of percentages might suggest a game of making numbers go up in proportion to the implosion of your grey matter, but speaking to Nic last week, the developers insisted that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendants-endgame-wont-be-about-meaningless-dps-or-piling-on-specs">The First Descendant's endgame won't be about "meaningless DPS" or "piling on specs"</a>. </p>
<p>While I don't have a review to share just yet, our hardware editor James Archer laid hands and eyes on a near-final preview build a week or so back, and concluded that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-pc-performance-best-settings">The First Descendant's performance could still use a bit of love</a>. He was mixed, much like the current Steam user reviews, as to whether the game itself is worth the time. "I don't dislike The First Descendant," James wrote. "It has a good grasp of the numbers-go-up-yay appeal behind looter shooters. Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad."</p>
<p>James has also written about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-steam-deck">The First Descendant's Steam Deck optimal Steam Deck settings</a>, commenting that "a mixture of Low and Medium seems like the best compromise".</p>

			<p>Starfield has just been made much better on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, thanks to a new mod that finally allows seamless interplanetary travel.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/473137ab-9f9a-42fa-8d4b-6b7536d63be0/IMPROVED_Sublight_Engine_Boost"> IMPROVED Sublight Engine Boost mod</a>, which is also available on PC, not only allows seamless interplanetary travel between planets and moons but also introduces tweaks for ship engines to make traveling more enjoyable, such as giving every engine extended boost time to make ships accelerate to great speeds. The ship's speed depends on the mass of the ship itself and how many engines are attached, but only Starborn ships are the ones capable of traveling at the fastest speed.</p>
<p>While this Starfield mod is still in early development, online reports say it already works great, so bearing with some of its issues is definitely Worth it to make the game more immersive than ever. Hopefully, Bethesda will take note and introduce a proper interplanetary system in future updates.</p>
<p>Starfield was updated multiple times since its release last year, but the best is definitely yet to come, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/">annual story expansions</a> Bethesda is planning to release. The first one, Shattered Space, will be set on a single planet and will be as big as Fallout 4's Far Harbor DLC.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Alongside the usual standard and nightmare modes, upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> (née Dreadwolf) will ship with a fully tweakable set of difficulty options called ‘Unbound’, letting you customise everything from parry timings to invincibility.<!--more-->
</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay">Game Informer</a>, the list of adjustables includes options to change “how wayfinding helps you in-game,” an aim assistance feature including a full-on auto-aim option, and combat timing and parry windows split into easy, normal, and harder selections. You can make enemies hit stronger or less so, and give them more or less health. There’s an option to adjust what the GI piece calls “enemy pressure”, which I’m assuming is how aggressively and frequently they attack. You can also make yourself invincible at any time, like I used to do as a small annoying child inventing the rules to games as they went along. Ah, but I think you'll find I have infinity plus <em>two</em> laser guns, actually. </p>

<p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," game director Corinne Busche told GI. “It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up." Alongside these options, Busche told GI that players can additionally “can look forward to similar accessibility and approachability options” as those you might expect, although there’s no exact confirmation yet on what these might entail. Either way, there’s a real advantage to these sort of difficulty options even if you never plan on using them, I think. Keeping things like wayfinding as a tweakable parameter frees up the default experience to be a little less overt with its signposting, and perhaps a little more interesting with its combat.</p>
<p>“I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer,” Edwin wrote of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">45 minute hands-on-seat-rests preview</a> he bore witness to at this Summer Games Fest past. “If Veilguard can carve out the cruft without reducing party members to sidekicks, it could be the soft reboot this long-absent RPG series needs.”</p>

            <p>A UK employment tribunal have ordered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium to pay around £27,748 - approximately $35,230 - in compensation for discriminating against former senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion, who was dismissed in 2022 after his requests to work from home following an office move were denied.</p><!--more-->
<p>Ah-Thion, who is autistic, joined Cloud Imperium in 2018. As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a>, he was based at the space sim developer's former offices in Wilmslow, before Cloud Imperium instructed employees to work from home in line with UK Covid pandemic lockdown requirements. In 2021, following the cessation of more stringent social distancing measures, Cloud Imperium opened a new headquarters in Manchester, and required staff to return to the office.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion, however, had found that working from home allowed him to avoid what he describes as the exhaustion and distress of working on Cloud Imperium's premises. The article doesn't go into detail about this, but it's worth noting here that many autistic people have <a href="https://employmentautism.org.uk/managing-workplace-sensory-issues/">great difficulty</a> with the sensory environment and social expectations of in-office work, unless proper accommodations are made.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion applied for a permanent remote working arrangement following the mandated return to the office, but was quickly denied by Cloud Imperium. The two parties went back and forth over the request, and Cloud Imperium eventually dismissed Ah-Thion in July 2022, citing performance issues related to his remote working setup. During the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/654cfca75d60950011bec8aa/Mr_P_Ah-_Thion_v_Cloud_Imperium_Games_Limited_2406047_2022.pdf">subsequent employment tribunal</a>, Cloud Imperium claimed he was unable to meet certain job criteria, such as mentoring junior staffers, when working remotely.</p>
<p>The tribunal, however, rejected many of Cloud Imperium's justifications for the dismissal, noting that in the absence of a formal investigation of Ah-Thion at the time, "concern about the claimant's performance seemed rather retrospective". According to a Cloud Imperium witness at the trial,  the company never formally asked Ah-Thion to return to the office, despite their alleged misgivings about the impact of remote-working on his performance.</p>
<p>The tribunal also found that Cloud Imperium "failed to give any evidence to suggest why they could not monitor [Ah-Thion's performance] successfully remotely whilst he was working from home" and that "there is no evidence that working from home would have failed to achieve the respondent's legitimate aim of ensuring the acceptable performance of a senior gameplay programmer". As such the tribunal's conclusion is that Cloud Imperium "treated the claimant unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of his disability", and that the company could have offered the <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/employment-adjustments-tips">reasonable adjustment</a> of letting him work from home.</p>
<p>"We find there was a failure of the respondent to understand the nature of the claimant's autism," the judgement comments. "It was a condition of his autism that he struggled with his duties to act as a coach, reviewer and mentor to the junior members of the team. The evidence shows that the claimant was struggling to do this when he worked in the office."</p>
<p>Game Developer also has some comment from Ah-Thion himself, who calls attention to what he calls a "tick-box mentality" to looking after disabled workers at companies who think that "sending a manager on a two-hour course about a disability is all they need to do". 

"I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging," he told the site. "But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees."</p>
<p>"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing - all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did." The legislation Ah-Thion refers to here is presumably the UK's <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">2010 equality act</a>.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium are far from the only company to have shed staff in the course of ordering a return to the office. In December 2023, Activision Blizzard announced plans to end hybrid remote/in-office work for QA staff based in Minneapolis, Austin and El Segundo, in what the ABK Workers Alliance <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">described as a round of "soft layoffs"</a>, with some staff potentially forced to leave due to being immunocompromised or the sheer financial cost of the commute. Rockstar announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">the end of hybrid working</a> in February 2024, citing a mixture of concerns about "quality and polish" together with security considerations in regards to GTA 6. By contrast, Crytek <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-make-working-from-home-a-permanent-option-for-staff">made working from home a permanent option for staff</a> in April 2022.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream will be released on October 4th. This upcoming game in the Sword Art Online series concentrates its main focus on multiplayer gameplay, enabling up to twenty players to collaborate and confront the formidable challenges found within Alfheim Online. Additionally, a new story trailer has been unveiled, providing a glimpse into the story that players will encounter in Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream.</p>
<p><iframe title="SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream — Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amjCHqUtIZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gist of the story is that the Galaxia system, which powers Alfheim Online, has become corrupted and uncontrollable. This malfunction leads to the collision of different versions of the world, creating an entirely new reality. Characters from various Sword Art Online arcs are brought together in this unique realm, causing former enemies to join forces as they strive to reset the timeline and return to their original worlds.</p>
<p>Pre-orders have gone live today for the three versions of Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream, which are the Standard, Digital Deluxe, and Digital Premium editions. The standard edition will include the game and a pre-order bonus of the Demon King costume set. The Digital Premium edition includes the game, the Character Pass Volume 1 giving access to DLC 1 and DLC 2 of Worlds Beyond, a bonus stamp set, and the Prism Heart costume set. The Digital Deluxe edition includes all of the above plus the digital artbook and soundtrack, and the Wild Joker dress. Those who pre-order the Premium or Deluxe versions will get three days early access too, along with the Demon King costume set.</p>

<p>Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>

			<p>The freshly-released GTA 5 Evil Soul mod is a horror-themed gameplay mod that aims to terrify players.</p>
<p>Created by modder 'AlexDevilish', the Evil Soul mod for Rockstar's 2013 title (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which keeps outselling more recent AAA releases</a>), is currently in beta and puts players in a nightly setting between 00:00 and 03:00 in which they need to survive the horror. The creator doesn't recommended this mod for the 'younger' players to those fainthearted. "Experience lights being cut off and watch everyone around you die and burn", the description of the mod reads. "and watch objects float around you like in the horror movies you used to watch. She is not so merciful as she watches you observing the terror around you."</p>
<p>According to the odder, "something" is watching over you when using this horror mod. And this "something" is evil, and not happy.</p>
<p>In order for this mod to work, users will need to download and install the ScriptHook V plugin.</p>
<p>Those interested can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/902?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the Evil Soul mod from Nexusmods here</a>. We've included a gameplay video of the mod in action below. As you might have guessed, this mod is only available for the PC version of GTA 5.</p>

<p>GTA V is available worldwide now across PC and consoles. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> back in May of this year, Rockstar is currently gearing up to release the highly-anticipated next entry in the series, GTA 6, in Fall 2025. GTA 6 is expected to have a map <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-map-two-times-bigger-gta-v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">size two times bigger than GTA 5's map size</a>.</p>

            <p>The tabletop equivalent of “buying books and reading them are two different hobbies” is surely the difference between buying sexy tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> manuals and actually dragging your mates on to Discord for a few hours to stumble your way through a module. It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crosssover-roll-for-initiative">CrossOver: Roll For Initiative</a>. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.</p>

<p>The titular ‘roll for initiative’ is a D6 roll before the start of a round to see how many bonus seconds of prep you get, although you can pause and take stock at any time. “Hardcore match-3 RPG puzzle meets action-strategy tower defence. Far from a casual game!” is how it describes itself. This is a silly way to sell your game, since the screenshots and concept already convinced me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713080/CrossOver_Roll_For_Initiative/">Steam demo</a> anyways. You did not need to brag to me about how pendulously engorged deez D10s are. I might even suggest that using the words “Hardcore” and “not casual” in your description makes you come across like a dickhead, inanimate store page. Still, I forgive you, because CrossOver is delightfully novel, good coffee-break fun, and very easy to understand, despite its blustering.</p>
<p>You get a single move to create a line of three dice in the match-3 tray, and different abilities cost different dice. I <em><strong>think </strong></em>the tray is seeded so more powerful dice are rarer, though I can’t be sure. Seems like there’s a lot of variety too, even in the limited demo build. Some spells do damage, some slow down the tiny pixel enemies attacking you or carry other status effects. There are also different classes and species to play, so you do actually get to customise your own character sheet before choosing a module from your virtual bookshelf.</p>
<p>I am falling back on both mine and Edwin’s default stance of the Marge Simpson school of potato critique here, but despite the trademark, clut-intricate Microprosaic UI: It's neat! I especially liked the CYOA encounters, with monochrome fantasy art, that bookend main sessions as you travel across a map. These are deeply confusing in regards to what level of meta the game is operating on, but not everything can be Princess Bride I guess. So yeah! Aside from the store description making me want to actually quote Princess Bride, this one’s well worth the download click if you want some, uh, casual dice fun.</p>

			<p>Nearly five months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-art-online-fractured-daydream-is-a-large-scale-co-op-multiplayer-game-with-raids-for-up-to-20-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's announcement</a>, Bandai Namco has now confirmed the final launch date for SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream. The large-scale multiplayer action game will debut on October 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Digital pre-orders are already open, offering customers the choice between three editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. All pre-orders (except for the Standard Edition on Switch, for some reason) will get the Demon King costume set freebie, which can be equipped on the SKIN tab of the CUSTOMIZE screen after completing the first story mission.</p>
<p>The Digital Deluxe Edition of SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream is priced at $84.99 and includes three days of early access, Character Pass Vol.1 (DLC 1 Worlds Beyond 1 and DLC 2 Worlds Beyond 2), a Bonus Stamp Set, and a Prism Heart Costume Set. Finally, the Premium Edition is priced at $99.99 and adds a Wild Joker Dress and a digital artbook + soundtrack combo to the aforementioned items.</p>
<p>Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>
<p><em>Galaxia, a new system allowing players to relive the past, has been added to ALfheim Online; however, Galaxia spins out of control causing players from all over time and space to be displaced! To set the timeline back on track, Kirito must work with fallen friends...and foes.</em></p>
<p><em>Each with their own specific role on the battlefield, SAO characters from various arcs are gathered to fight. Team up with a total of 20 players from around the world in 1 of 5 parties comprised of 4 players each for multiplayer co-op action.</em></p>
<p><em>True to the SWORD ART ONLINE series, join a raid party and prepare for a fight with high difficulty bosses together! How you prepare for the fight is the key to victory!</em></p>

			<p>Although there has been a relative deluge of high quality indie games released over the past few months, Crow Country has been at the top of my wishlist since I checked out the demo last year. Offering a combination of classic survival horror gameplay and PS1-influenced aesthetics, it nails both and offers a gaming experience that manages to feel innovative and nostalgic at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crow Country - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YP2gQszmHM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When you first start up Crow Country the retro aesthetic hits you with its fusion of pre-rendered backgrounds and polygonal characters. Such is the wave of nostalgia that it took me a while to realise that you can freely move the camera to examine the environments rather than being restricted to fixed angles. Once you do pick up on this full control however, you’ll quickly find that the various locations have items, secrets, and hidden details to find throughout. The visual design is excellent and interactive spots are easy to distinguish despite the initially busy artstyle.</p>


<p>You play as Special Agent Mara Forest, a mysterious investigator and firearms expert who may be more than they first seem. Mara is sent to investigate the derelict theme park, Crow Country, after a missing person’s report is filed for the park’s owner. Once Mara makes it to Crow Country, however, it soon becomes clear that there is something odd happening there. The narrative is revealed skilfully through a series of notes and newspaper articles scattered around the park, alongside conversations with the few survivors you meet along the way.</p>


<p>Beginning with a trusty pistol and a trunk full of bullets (handy for when you run out in the early game) Mara can find a range of traditional weapons to help her fight off the many strange creatures she faces. While many of these can be avoided in classic survival horror fashion, doing so can lead areas to become especially crowded and dangerous when tracking back – and tracking back is something you’ll be doing a lot of during Crow Country’s runtime. The map is relatively small but every space plays an important part with many packed with puzzles to solve and enemies to deal with.</p>
<p>Controls are smooth and responsive with classic and modern options available. Perhaps most crucially, the devs have thought to offer tank controls on the D-pad and modern on the analogue stick, a feature that I have long argued all survival horror games should have. That being said, the tank controls are less essential here than in fixed camera games and I mostly stuck with the modern ones. My only real criticism of the game is the lack of Resident Evil style snap aiming as it can sometimes be difficult to judge angles (although laser sights are hidden around the map for each of your weapons).</p>

<p>The puzzles here are refreshingly logical on the whole and offer a pleasant aspect of gameplay rather than any particular roadblock. Most revolve around finding the right item and using it in the correct spot but there are more complicated riddles which hide secrets across the map. Solving these is optional but the rewards will definitely help you out – whilst finding all of them is needed to unlock the higher completion ranks. Much like recent Resident Evil games, finishing with a better rank gives you special items to play through again, and a Hard mode is in the works for a free addition soon.</p>
<p>Crow Country isn’t an especially long game, but what’s here is so well designed that it’ll leave you wanting more without feeling short-changed. My initial playthrough took about four hours and then I ran through a second time in the no combat mode to hunt for the secrets I missed. I’ll be looking to aim for the Platinum by doing at least one more run to get the S rank as well so there’s a decent amount of content.</p>

			<p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind the recently-released Tales of Kenzera ZAU, is the next game studio hit by layoffs.</p>
<p>Following a massive way of layoffs this year at numerous studios, including both large and smaller developers, the studio founded by actor Abubakar Salim is now also hit by layoffs. Some days ago, several developers at the studio already <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social/post/3kw6b3osppn2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that layoffs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be inbound</a>, and on X, the studio has <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now confirmed</a> that a "dozen people" will be losing their jobs.</p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, Surgent has joined the growing number of games studios impacted by layoffs this year with over a dozen people affected"</em>, the official statement from the studio reads.</p>
<p><em>"It's a difficult time in the games industry, but we remain incredibly proud of our entire team's work on ZAU and of the praise it has received from critics and players alike. Our focus now is on supporting those affected, continuing our work on ZAU, and looking to the future with out next creative projects."<br>
</em></p>
<p>Following this dreadful news, founder Salim also <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1808221598983544959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> to address the layoffs and to ask for help from the community in finding new positions for those affected. "Thank you so much to those who have checked in", he wrote. "This hurts deeply. This isn't the news I wanted to share today."</p>
<p>He added, "So to be delivering this news today really sucks. I know we're not alone here, but that doesn't make it easier. The focus now is to continue supporting those affected in anyway we can. I will be replying to this with links to posts from our affected team members."</p>
<p>We can only wish those affected by the layoffs and Surgent Studios the best going forward.</p>
<p>Published by EA under the EA Originals labels,&nbsp;Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released back in April of this year for PC and consoles. We spoke highly of the Metroidvania our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review</a> back then.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Kenzera: ZAU proves that innovation isn't always necessary to craft a compelling experience. With its heartfelt story, compelling protagonist, and solid metroidvania gameplay featuring excellent pacing, Zau's journey is one that resonates, especially for those grappling with similar grief to the young shaman.</em></p>
