            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-here%E2%80%99s-how-to-prepare.996795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is officially set to release on October 8, where players will get to utilize the new class named <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/">the Spiritborn</a>, while also working to cleanse the jungle of Mephisto's minions in an attempt to help Neyrelle. Vessel of Hatred follows directly from the campaign of the base game, and players have to track down Neyrelle and assist the people of Nahantu while fighting off the machinations of Mephisto. Vessel of Hatred officially launches globally on October 8, with some timezones accessing it on October 7.</p>
<p>Diablo IV's new expansion releases on October 7 at 7 PM EDT / 4 PM PDT / 8 PM BRT, with the rest of the world being able to access the content in the expansion on October 8. Below is a picture of all of the launch times that players need to be aware of.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're preparing for Vessel of Hatred, this is officially your last chance to get the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140359/what-you-need-to-know-for-vessel-of-hatred-s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-purchase rewards</a>, which include a Snow Leopard Pet, 1 Month of Game Pass Ultimate, and Mother's Lament Legendary Gem for Diablo Immortal.</p>
<p>Additionally, for those who have purchased Vessel of Hatred ahead of launch, the expansion will be available for pre-download on Battle.net as of September 30 at 4 PM PDT / 7 PM EDT / 12 AM BST, with the pre-download on console being available on October 5 at 4 PM PDT / 7 PM EDT and 12 AM BST.</p>
<p>You'll have to create a new character in either the Eternal or Seasonal realm to get stuck into the campaign. While you do have the option to level through the base game campaign, you can skip to the Vessel of Hatred campaign simply by pressing "Skip Campaign." Although you don't need to have completed the base game campaign to be able to start the DLC, it is thoroughly recommended, as it will provide essential information for the story to make complete sense. However, if you prefer to just skip ahead to the expansion, you just need to have completed the prologue on one character to be able to skip the campaign fully.</p>
<p>Along with a new story to complete, Vessel of Hatred adds a lot of new updates to Diablo IV. Plenty of the content added to the game will be available to those who don't own the expansion, including the systemic changes to leveling, difficulty tiers, and the Paragon System. There is now a new max level of 60 and a new Paragon max level of 300.</p>
<p>Those who log in from October 8 to November 8 and complete the Dark Citadel can get the Reins of the Longfur Beast, a cat mount you can obtain. There will also be three weapon cosmetics to obtain once you log into Diablo IV when the expansion drops.</p>

Your job is to pick a weapon type/play style and use it to hunt sizable monsters roaming the land.

<p>PlayStation 5 owners are reporting advertisements on the device’s home screen. Frustratingly, the ads seem to be rather difficult to disable, and some are also outdated ads and/or confusing content.</p>
<p>The ads, visible on users' home screens when they hover over a game title, can only be removed if you disconnect from the Internet, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-homescreen-now-replaces-unique-video-game-art-with-annoying-ads-you-cant-turn-off">IGN</a> reported today. However, that would block a lot of the console’s functionality. The PS5 dashboard previously had ads but not on the home screen.</p>
<p>Before this recent development, people would see game art if they hovered over a game icon on the PS5’s home screen. Now, doing so reportedly brings up dated advertisements. For example, IGN reported seeing <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/img-5026-1727699908609.JPG">an ad for <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a> “coming soon exclusively in cinemas” when hovering over the <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> game. Webheads will of course recall that the Spider-Verse movie came out in June 2023.</p>
<p>Similarly, going to<em> NBA 2K25</em> reportedly shows an <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/img-5030-1727704091595.JPG">ad for gaining early access</a>. But the game came out early this month.</p>
<p>Per IGN, it seems that the console is “pulling in the latest news for each game, whether it be a YouTube video, patch notes, or even the announcement of a different game entirely.” That means that not all games are showing advertisements. Instead, some show an image for a <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/20240930125222-1727699095185.jpg">YouTube video about the game</a> or a note about patch notes or updates for the game.</p>
<p>There also seem to be some mix-ups, with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ps5-new-ui-update-also-brought-unwanted-forced-news-feed-and-ads-to-select-titles">MP1st</a> reporting seeing an <a href="https://mp1st.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ps5-welcome-hub-ad.webp">ad for the <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> game</a> when hovering over the icon for<em> Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. The publication wrote: “The ad also make[s it] confusing a bit, as... it looks like you’re playing LEGO Horizon Adventures and not the <em>actual</em>&nbsp;Horizon game we’re on.”</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Some games, like<em> Astro Bot</em>, however, don’t seem to be affected by the changes, per IGN.</p>
<h2>Annoyed and confused</h2>
<p>Gamers noticing the change have taken to the web to share their annoyance, disappointment, and, at times, confusion about the content suddenly forced into the PS5's home screen.</p>
<p>“As someone playing through the Spiderman series now, this confused the hell out of me,” Crack_an_ag said via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/comment/lpna0k6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit.</a></p>
<p>Others are urging Sony to either remove the feature or fix it so that it can be helpful, while others argue that the feature <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/comment/lpnb9le/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">couldn’t be helpful regardless.</a></p>
<p>“Forcing every single game to make its latest news story its dashboard art is SO stupid as no one game uses the news feature consistently," Reddit user jackcos <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/comment/lpnqxim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Sam88FPS, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/comment/lpn3bev/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">noted</a> that ads drove them from Xbox to PlayStation:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main reasons I moved away from Xbox was the fact they started to build the Xbox UI around ads and pushing [Game Pass]. Hopefully Sony listens more because Xbox absolutely refused to, in fact, they even added full screen startup ads lmao.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear what exactly prompted this change. Some suspect it’s related to firmware update 24.06-10.00.00. But that update came out on September 12, and, as IGN noted, its patch notes don’t say anything about this. Considering the obvious problems and mix of content being populated, it’s possible that Sony is working out some kinks and that eventually the content shown on users' home screens will become more relevant or consistent. The change has also come a few days after a developer claimed that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/21/new-report-says-sonys-concord-cost-400-million-to-make/">Sony lost $400 million </a>after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">pulling the <em>Concord</em> online game</a> after just two weeks, prompting digs at Sony and unconfirmed theories that Sony is trying to make up for financial losses with ads.</p>
<p>Ars Technica has reached out to Sony about why it decided to add non-removable ads to the PS5 home screen and about the outdated and otherwise perplexing content being displayed. We’ll let you know if we hear back.</p>

            <p>
Pokémon Unite, the hugely popular free-to-play MOBA from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s TiMi Studios, is being yanked offline in Belgium and Netherlands from November next year, amid the countries' ongoing crackdown on loot boxes in games.
</p>
<p>
All versions of Pokémon Unite - that is, on Android, iOS, and Switch - will be pulled from digital stores on 30th November 2025, but subscriptions and in-game items will cease to be available much earlier. They'll no longer be purchasable from 31st October this year.
</p>
<p>
"We'd like to thank our players in Belgium and Netherlands for their support," The Pokémon Company wrote in an <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-gb/news/notice-of-termination/">announcement on its website</a>, "and we apologise for any inconvenience."

<p>
While no reason for the game's termination was provided in The Pokémon Company's statement, the decision is almost certainly related to loot box restrictions in Belgium and Netherlands. Loot boxes have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal">illegal</a> under Belgium's gambling laws since 2018 (although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-study-claims-belgiums-loot-box-law-isnt-being-enforced">enforcement has reportedly been patchy</a>), while the Netherlands government <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dutch-political-parties-back-gaming-loot-box-ban">continues to pursue a loot box ban</a> and close a loophole that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-10m-dutch-fifa-loot-box-fine-has-been-overturned">let EA off the hook</a> in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Unite - which features a loot box-style mechanic known as the Prize Machine - wouldn't be the only game to wave goodbye to Belgium and Netherlands thanks to their loot box laws. In 2022, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lootbox-laws-reportedly-block-diablo-immortal-launches">scrapped Diablo Immortal's launch</a> as a result of "the current operating environment for games in those countries", while other titles - such as the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> - have had their loot boxes removed in response to the restrictions.
</p>
<p>
In the UK, the previous Conservative government was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-government-demands-changes-to-better-protect-young-people-from-loot-boxes">less inclined to draft legislation</a> concerning loot boxes, but warned the UK games industry that laws would be drafted if it didn't protect young people from them. In response, UKIE (the UK industry's trade association) last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">announced 11 Principles</a> as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-absolutely-rocks-says-no-mans-sky-developer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>So far, we haven't heard much about the PS5 Pro straight from developers with the notable exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-games-get-detailed-specs-and-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments gathered by Sony</a> for the official PlayStation Blog last week. However, No Man's Sky Engine Programmer Martin Griffiths <a href="https://x.com/Griff_/status/1840090665570467889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to Twitter (X)</a> to share all his excitement about the upcoming hardware in a very spontaneous capacity.</p>
<p><em>This beautifully staged screenshot is a fair summary of how I feel tonight. Many of you have noticed that No Man's Sky is now marked as a PS5 Pro enhanced title on the PlayStation store - the only thing I’d like to say, as an engine programmer who has been through all the PS iterations since PS1, is that this console absolutely rocks. </em></p>
<p><em>I want to add that this week, I virtually stood in the queue to order my home PS5 Pro - there is something really special about the journey from working on prototype hardware to it becoming a real thing with the immense intellectual and human effort it takes from thousands of people to ship a console like this with more than 50 launch titles. I’ve never lost that child-like excitement I get when coding on a new dev kit or that same excitement when the real console arrives at home and you boot up a game you’ve worked on for the first time. The brilliant tranquil image I linked off summed up the launch milestone perfectly for everyone at Hello who has worked hard to reach this point - we can quietly breathe again and take pride that our tiny team is part of this.</em></p>
<p>It is high praise from such an experienced industry veteran. Griffiths has worked on games as diverse as Populous: The Beginning and Dungeon Keeper 2 to Quake III, Need for Speed: Shift, Syndicate, and Project CARS before joining Hello Games to work on No Man's Sky, which is currently one of 56 games confirmed to be enhanced for the PS5 Pro console.</p>
<p>The UK studio has not shared any details yet on how it plans to take advantage of the increased power. Interestingly, No Man's Sky already runs at 4K and 60 frames per second on PS5 (and Xbox Series X). As such, the only meaningful way to enhance the game further would be to allow it to run at 4K@120FPS or, more likely, to push the graphics settings. One great way to do so would be to add ray tracing effects, which, however, are currently missing even on the PC version.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7 for $699.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, the Commander Rules Committee updated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-update-enrages-fanbase" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the ban list</a> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering's</em></a> Commander format. It was a contentious change to the meta that enraged fans so much that Wizards of the Coast will take over the committee's duties.</p>
<h2>The Future of Magic: The Gathering Commander Format</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-the-future-of-commander">blog post</a>, WIzards of the Coast explained their plans for curating the Commander format for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The post starts with commending the Commander Rules Committee, a small group of five passionate talented individuals. Individuals that contribute to the committee while working full-time jobs and raising families.</p>

Due to the escalating outrage of recent events, personal threats have been sent to committee members, Wizards of the Coast expressly states a zero tolerance policy on this front.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;This is something we will not tolerate. No matter how you feel about something in Magic, it is never appropriate to threaten somebody. Everyone at Wizards of the Coast is united on this front—we will not hesitate to take action against individuals who threaten to harm community members or employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CRC corroborated WIzards of the Coast's official statement. In a thread of <a href="https://x.com/mtgcommander/status/1840783614294069286">social media posts</a> on X (formerly known as Twitter), the CRC stated that they could no longer operate as an independent entity as a result of these threats. They are sad that this marks the end of an era, but WOTC has assured them that they do not wish to change the vision of Commander as a community-focused format.</p>

<p>According to the post, both the CRC and the design team are still in preliminary conversations about the future of Commander. This includes a new approach to deck power level and more guidance for players looking for a format that suits their style of play.</p>

According to the developer, <em>Neva </em>will follow the growing relationship between the two, who start as unlikely allies before becoming inseparable companions.</p><p>I’ve been excited for <em>Neva </em>for a while now and it looks like an improvement in so many ways from Nomada’s stunning debut. <em>Neva </em>maintains the platforming of <em>Gris</em>, but builds upon it with way more mechanics, which are incredibly welcome! For instance, this time around <em>Neva </em>will feature combat and Alba will make use of her sword when fighting off monsters rather than in <em>Gris</em>, where the protagonist avoids conflict at all costs. It seems like when Alba and the wolf first find one another, Alba must work to protect it, but as the wolf grows, it might become an ally in combat, and can maybe even be directed.</p><p><em>Neva</em>, much like <em>Gris </em>before it, is absolutely gorgeous. Ever since its debut trailer, I’ve been in awe of its style, which feels much looser than <em>Gris</em>’ sharp linework, and consequently more expressive. It is also more naturalistic than Nomada’s previous game, seemingly placing an emphasis on the collapsing world in an effort to reflect the real life consequences of climate change on our ecosystems. If that’s the case, <em>Neva </em>appears to be a beautiful tragedy, and I wouldn’t be surprised if just like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a hell of a tearjerker. </p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Neva:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fneva%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fneva%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-recommend-id="image://6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some Neva concepgt art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Rumors of a Final Fantasy IX remake have been echoing around RPG circles for at least year now, with series fans hopeful that they may soon get to revisit one of the most beloved entries in the series. But if a Final Fantasy IX remake does materialize, it may face some big challenges.</p><p>Speaking with the website <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games</a>, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki Yoshida talked a bit about what a remake might look like. He warns that it may not all fit in one game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Top 10 Final Fantasy Bosses</h3></div></output><p>"Of course, I do know there  are requests for Final Fantasy IX to be made, but when you think about Final Fantasy IX, it’s a game with huge volume," Yoshida says. "When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question."</p><p>Yoshida seems to be suggesting that a potential remake could go the direction of Final Fantasy VII Remake, which is in the middle of a planned trilogy. Fans have long had mixed feelings about splitting it into multiple parts, which offers the opportunity to add plenty of new elements, but also slows the pacing. As it stands, the third part of the trilogy doesn't figure to be out until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>Yoshida is right about Final Fantasy IX being a big game. It's absolutely loaded with sidequests, minigames, and other content, and it's set in a very large world. Reproducing all of that material won't be easy for any development team that takes on a remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for Yoshida himself, he's interested in remaking a different game in the series. "The one that I would like to make myself would be Final Fantasy III, I think."</p><p>For longtime fans of the series, Yoshida is referring to the version released on the Famicom, not the Americanized Final Fantasy VI. It's a deep cut as Final Fantasy releases go, but very much in keeping with Yoshida's attitude as Final Fantasy XIV's producer.</p><p>Yoshida touches on a handful of other details in the interview, including his favorite Final Fantasy VII minigame (snowboarding), an Xbox release of Final Fantasy XVI ("we do want to release it on Xbox"), and more. In the meantime, the wait for a Final Fantasy IX remake continues.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

                <p>The first State of Decay game came out all the way back in 2013, and the franchise is still growing. Following 2018's sequel, State of Decay 2, a third game is now in the works for Xbox and PC.</p><p>The biggest piece of news of late on State of Decay 3 is that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/state-of-decay-2-new-content-updates-are-ending-as-dev-prioritizes-state-of-decay-3/1100-6526276/" data-ref-id="1100-6526276">ramping up production</a>, as developer Undead Labs winds down development on State of Decay 2 and shifts to the third game. Here in this post, we're rounding up everything we know about State of Decay 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_State_of_Decay_3_release_">When will State of Decay 3 release?</h2><p>State of Decay 3 was announced back in 2020 but still does not have a release date. In fact, Undead Labs and Microsoft have not said much at all about the game.</p><h2 id="State_of_Decay_3_trailer">State of Decay 3 trailer</h2><p>The first state of State of Decay 3 trailer was released in 2020. The cinematic trailer showed a character tracking an animal's blood trail through the snow, only to discover a zombified deer. Pretty scary stuff! A second trailer, which debuted in 2024, showed off more of the game's world, but was again only a (very impressive-looking!) cinematic trailer and did not contain any gameplay footage.</p><p>You can

That's largely remained the status quo since, but a major development came in September 2024 when Undead Labs said it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/state-of-decay-2-new-content-updates-are-ending-as-dev-prioritizes-state-of-decay-3/1100-6526276/" data-ref-id="1100-6526276">winding down development on State of Decay 2</a> so its team members could shift to State of Decay 3.</p><p>"Our ambition is to make the greatest zombie survival sim in the franchise, and to do so, we'll be shifting our focus and resources to making the upcoming third installment, State of Decay 3," Undead Labs said.</p><p>Many are naturally wondering when State of Decay 3 will come out, but Undead Labs isn't ready to say just yet, saying more information will come "at a later time."</p><p>"Thank you for your continued support and for being the greatest gaming community there is. We’re excited to devote ourselves to making the next game even better," the studio said.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-s-sexism-microsoft-undea-1848728682" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku published a report</a> detailing alleged controversies within the studio, including allegations of sexism, bullying, and burnout. The report detailed how Microsoft's acquisition of Undead Labs was reportedly "hampered by toxic workplace conditions and lack of direction." In response, Xbox's Matt Booty said, "Undead Labs has seen a number of positive changes and we are confident in the direction the team is taking State of Decay 3, one of our most ambitious open-world games in development."</p>

Principal user research Deborah Hendersen said these are already used for players, but have been retooled to be more developer-focused.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data from these studies "will help us figure out both what to build and how to build things well," she said.

It also lets players turn off an optional news feed widget that pulls random announcements for all of the games they follow. Unfortunately, that news feed is now infecting the rest of the console’s home screen. </p><p>Tiles for installed games used to display background art or activity cards when you scrolled over them, but following a recent change they now pull from whatever the latest item is in that game’s news feed. Sometimes the results are harmless, but other times it means anything from YouTube thumbnails to marketing for other games takes over the screen when selecting specific games to play. </p><p>“So it turns out that the recent PS5 UI update that let you disable all the advertisements on the dashboard was too good to be true,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> user Earl Turlet over the weekend. “Now EVERY SINGLE GAME on your homescreen shows you an advertisement in the background with no way to remove them lol.” YouTuber Mystic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put together a thorough video</a></span> walking players through the changes. </p><p>The most egregious examples include a “what is Warhammer” video for <em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>, the <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> page showing a promotional image from <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse </em>which came out over a year ago, and accolade posts that plaster the art of a game with review scores and testimonials. Sometimes the newsfeed shows another game entirely, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition </em>on PS4 whose background art now shows <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> instead. “It’s a huge downgrade for the UI,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player on Reddit</a></span> calling for others to protest the changes. “<em>Elden Ring</em> is advertising a mousepad FFS.”</p><p>Hopefully, Sony reverts the change. Ideally, players would be allowed to customize the backgrounds for games just like they can on the welcome hub, choosing from official art or even their own screenshots. And if some players do want quick access to the newsfeeds for the corresponding games, maybe Sony can do a better job of displaying what they curate. In a lot of cases a simple list of the latest official headlines from the PlayStation Blog or social media accounts for those games would be a lot more useful than how the feeds are currently constructed.</p><p><strong> Update 9/30/2024 4:41 p.m. ET: </strong>The news feed issues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dshiatt/status/1840822267737162237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dshiatt/status/1840822267737162237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are a bug</a></span> according to PlayStation senior product manager Daniel Hiatt. It sounds like it will be fixed soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PlayStation 5 owners are reporting emotions ranging from mildly miffed to deep-seated annoyance following Sony's decision to plaster the console's homescreen with ugly artwork and often irrelevant promotional news stories following its latest update.
</p>
<p>
The changes - which appear to have been slowly rolled out over the last few weeks, gaining attention on social media this weekend -  mean the PS5 now prominently displays promotional article headlines across the centre of its homescreen alongside full-sized background images, based on whatever happens to be top of the currently selected game's newsfeed.
</p>
<p>
Now, rather than displaying aesthetically pleasing artwork when a game is highlighted as was previously the case, PlayStation 5's homescreen is a chaotic mishmash of random, busy promotional art (sometimes fighting against the existing UI) and drastically out-of-date news stories - which, in some cases, are only tangentially related to the chosen game.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, for instance, now, somewhat confusingly, displays a huge Lego Aloy image when the game is selected, with the most prominent bit of text onscreen reading, "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>". Some titles display promotions long past their expiration date or encouragement for a user to buy the very game they already own - while still others have somehow escaped the changes, displaying the old art just as they once did.

<p>
Home screen ads aren't exactly a rarity, of course, but Sony's implementation is a bit of a mess - not helped by the fact it seemingly can only be disabled by disconnecting the PS5 from the internet. And as users begin to familiarise themselves with the changes, they're being met with an understandable degree of discontent. "I'm starting to feel alienated by PlayStation’s choices," wrote I_pee_in_shower over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/ps5_new_ui_update_also_brought_ads_you_cant_turn/">on the PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, "I don't want ads, games as service or to rebuy my console halfway though cycle."
</p>
<p>
"This update sucks," added the (clearly less than cheery) cheer_up_crewcut
. "Gone is the nice artwork when you hover over the game, and you just get the stupid news articles instead. Some of them are really low-res too and it looks really ugly. Makes the home screen look terrible.
</p>
<p>
Whether Sony chooses to listen to customer pleas and rolls back the changes remains to be seen, but with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">£700 new console</a> looming, an unhappy player base probably isn't ideal.

		<p>Sabotage Studio has revealed Sea of Stars: Dawn of Equinox, a big free update that will add a new three-player local co-op mode, overhaul combat, revamp the prologue and much, much more.</p>
<p>Dawn of Equinox will release on 12th November, and again, it’s a totally free update for the game. Sea of Stars is out across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this is separate to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBnJv-rQjMM">the Throes of the Watchmaker DLC</a> – also a free release for owners of the game, coming in Spring 2025.</p>


<p>Here’s the Dawn of Equinox update breakdown from Sabotage Studios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-New Local Cooperative Play</strong> – Sea of Stars‘ story will be playable in its entirety by up to three players, with allies traversing the world together and mastering a new Cooperative Timed Hits combat mechanic.</li>
<li><strong>Combat 2.0</strong> – The addition of Mystery Locks brings a new gameplay loop around revealing the ways to break the spells of enemies each time a new type is encountered in battle. Along with “Reveal” functions added to some of the playable cast’s special skills, Combo Points now remain after battle, offering new ways to open certain encounters, or test different damage types on enemies to reveal their locks. A comprehensive balancing pass has also been done to reflect both these new changes and player feedback since launch.</li>
<li><strong>A Revamped Prologue</strong> – Implementing combat for the young versions of our heroes, the updated flow does away with the flashback structure to begin in their childhood, directly including <a title="Genres > Action [2,216 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> in the prologue.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Cinematic Scene</strong> – An entirely new cutscene has been added to accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure, referred to as “Paths on Water.”</li>
<li><strong>A Speedrunner Mode Relic</strong> – This new item activates a range of features helpful for those looking to set a new personal best or world record.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Presets</strong> – Three difficulty options are now available when starting a new game, which are presets using the game’s Relics. New Relics have also been added, both for quality of life and difficulty adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Parrot Relic</strong> – Sea of Stars‘ secret-tracking parrot has learned a few new tricks to better assist players tracking down overlooked challenges and collectibles.</li>
<li><strong>Quebecois Localization</strong> – A comprehensive French Canadian translation for Quebec’s finest Solstice Warriors.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong> – A constellation of general updates and improvements spanning Sea of Stars‘ full campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “</p>

		<p>Starfield: Shattered Space is now live, the first big story expansion for Bethesda’s sci-fi RPG revealing a new hand-crafted planet to explore and telling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/17/starfield-shattered-space-deep-dive-reveals-more-about-house-varuuns-broken-homeworld/">the story of House Va’ruun</a>. But how can you get access to Shattered Space, and when can you play it within Starfield’s progression?</p>

<p>Shattered Space is available in two ways. You can get it as a separate purchase, for $29.99 / £29.99 on the Microsoft Store (with a 10% discount for Game Pass subscribers), or it’s $29.99 / £25.99 on Steam for users of that storefront.</p>
<p>It’s also bundled in with the Premium and Constellation Editions of Starfield.&nbsp;Owners of the Standard Edition can also purchase the Digital Premium Upgrade ($35 / £35 on Xbox) to access the DLC, and also get the Digital Art Book, Original Soundtrack, 1,000 Creation Credits and the Constellation Skin Pack. This applies also to Game Pass players, who can grab the upgrade and play while subscribed.</p>


<p>The DLC is an additional download – around 10GB on Xbox Series X|S – that you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/starfield-shattered-space-update-1-14-70-has-plenty-of-fixes-and-improvements/">alongside the latest Starfield update</a> in order to play.</p>

<h2>How to access and play Shattered Space</h2>
<p>Once you’ve bought Starfield: Shattered Space – maybe you had it since day one? – how can you actually get at this new location and quest?</p>

<p>Shattered Space is woven in alongside the rest of the main game’s stories, but it’s a separate adventure that you can play almost whenever you like.&nbsp;All you&nbsp;<em>need</em> to do is play the introductory mission of the main game, ‘One Small Step’. After you’ve completed the first grav-jump to a location that is not used by a mission or triggered another encounter, players will receive a distress call and be led to the star station that introduces you to Shattered Space’s story.</p>
<p>Complete the first quest and then jump to a random planet, basically.</p>
<p>But should you take it on this early in the game? Maybe it’s best to wait. You can play Shattered Space, but Bethesda recommend reaching level 35 for the best experience.</p>

Unfortunately, while the game does a lot to build Zelda up by providing her an arsenal of Echoes and limited transformation powers, as you reach the final challenge of the game the story seems happy to put Zelda back into her box as a supporting character.</p>
<p><strong>We're going into endgame spoilers, so if you haven't completed <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, it's best to bookmark this and come back to it to share your thoughts on the ending.</strong></p>
<h2>Echoes and Swordplay</h2>
<p>The main power that you'll be using through your adventure is Zelda's Echoes, which she can learn and create with the power of the Tri Rod. At the beginning of the game, you get echoes such as a bed, a small rock, and common enemies like Zol and Guays.</p>
<p>With each new region that you explore, you'll get to find increasingly powerful enemies to take as your own. You might not be able to take on a Wolfos alone, but a small army of other creatures will be powerful enough to turn the tide of battle.</p>

You can create some level of offence by directing or throwing these enemies but it's normally better to just let them do their job.</p>
<p>For when Zelda does want to go on the full offence the other ability that she picks up through her journey is a limited transformation into a Swordsman. Here she can swing a sword to create a more traditional <em>Zelda</em> experience. The energy to use this power though exclusively comes from creatures made of the Still World.</p>
<h2>Boss Battles Teach You Balance</h2>
<p>Boss battles in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> show you the best way to balance each of these abilities. A boss might need an Electric Keese to knock them to the ground, and then in that short moment of vulnerability by transforming into a Swordsman you can capitalize on damage.</p>
<p>The game even specifically rewards this type of play. Each time a boss gets up from being knocked down, it also dispenses some of the energy required to recharge your transformation gauge. It's the game telling you "The best time to use the Swordsman transformation is to take down the boss," which is why it makes no sense that for the final fight of the game, they rob you of this power.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-early-boss-fight.jpg?itok=mh9XtdVD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-early-boss-fight.jpg?itok=4iW4QXpx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Summon Echoes to stun the boss, then transform and use your sword to defeat them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Link Is the Hero of This Story</h2>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> starts with Link freeing Zelda but falling into the Still World, and it does make sense that by the end of the adventure Zelda frees him. But after freeing him, Zelda returns all of Link's items to him. That power of transformation that has been integral to every single boss fight is now unavailable to you.</p>
<p>This leads to a final boss fight where Link is not only present, but is active in combat and has unlimited health, allowing him to constantly be damaging Null, while Zelda is limited to only the ability to summon Echoes.</p>
<p>This final boss fight isn't some small endeavor either. With three major phases each of which has smaller segments, you'll be forced to experience the end of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> not as a triumphant hero but instead a witness to Link's almighty power while you spam Echoes that disappear in a single hit and dodge oncoming attacks like you're playing a bullet hell.</p>

<p>The formula for what has transpired here is not new. It's quite common for the climactic fight of a <em>Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;title to be Link getting support from Zelda to defeat the final foe.</p>
<p>In <em>Windwaker</em>, Zelda would shoot a Light Arrow for you to reflect, in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="911c8afd-39ed-4462-9fea-1481491f71c8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> Zelda allowed Link to get above Ganondorf's draconic form to slay him, and even in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b1fc47e4-03e6-44e4-8c27-6f953edc5ee5" href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time"><em>Ocarina of Time</em></a> Zelda threw the Master Sword back to Link for the final strike.</p>
<p>While I was hoping the formula would be "The main character gets support from the character they saved," instead the formula really is "Link saves the day with the help of Zelda."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-assistance.jpg?itok=IK-eCypy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-assistance.jpg?itok=Q1V-q4qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Zelda always assists Link, but never takes the spotlight</figcaption></figure><h2>How <em>Echoes Of Wisdom</em> Should Have Ended</h2>
<p>There are two key ways that the final battle of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could be altered to provide not only a more fitting finale, but one that Zelda deserves.</p>
<p>The first change would simply be to not rob Zelda of a major part of her move set for the final fight. Allow Zelda to keep the Sword, Bow, and Bombs and provide Link a variety of backup items to assist with. To keep Link in a truly support role this might be something as simple as having him outside the arena of combat, but able to throw in useful items that could put the final boss in a stunned state.</p>
<p>This would mean that Zelda is still the one driving the show, but in a similar way to how Zelda has supported in the past, it's now Link's turn to contribute without hogging the spotlight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-skorchill-boss-fight.jpg?itok=6gU2w-lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loz-echoes-of-wisdom-skorchill-boss-fight.jpg?itok=WtkNFKbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Skorchill boss fight is the perfect balance of alternating Echoes and implementing Zelda's transformation magic</figcaption></figure><p>The second change would be to have the final fight be more than who can hit the hardest. Ultimately this final battle is just "Can Link and the Echoes deal enough damage while Zelda dodges oncoming attacks."</p>
<p>When previous battles have you utilizing Electric Keese to shock enemies off walls and into reach or alternating fire and ice attacks as the arena changes, to have a battle that's just "summon Echoes and hope they hit before they die" is lackluster.</p>
<p>So much work and planning went into the start of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> to gracefully sideline Link, create wholly unique and fun powers for Zelda, and carefully scale those abilities throughout the game. It was truly a shame to see it end with Zelda becoming a damsel in distress.</p>
