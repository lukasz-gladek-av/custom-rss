<p>Helldivers 2 recently discussed their ‘plans’ to extend vehicle gameplay and bring back some vehicles from the previous game. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has been hard at work addressing Helldivers 2’s performance woes, recently reducing the game’s PC file size <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 85%</a>. They are simultaneously working on new content as well, such as a prototype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-working-on-a-rogue-lite-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rogue-lite mode</a>, along with ways to improve gameplay. The game’s design director recently spoke about vehicle gameplay. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-may-get-some-vehicles-from-the-original-game">Helldivers 2 May Get Some Vehicles from the Original Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-exosuit-mech-vehicle-gameplay-expansion-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, during the latest episode of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n4kiFv_gyg&amp;t=1110s&amp;pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Democratic Conversation</a>‘ on the Helldivers 2’s YouTube channel, the game’s design director, Niklas Malmborg, spoke about vehicle gameplay when asked about extending the duration of exosuit mechs. Malmborg stated, “We have plans, we are looking at extending vehicle gameplay.” </p>



<p>The design director added that players might remember that the previous Helldivers game had “loads more vehicles”, and maybe not all of them, but “it would be fun to bring back some of them”. He also spoke about looking into “how much you can do with vehicles, and all the nooks and crannies of it.” Malmborg stated, “not guaranteeing” players will be able to, as it works like a temporary buff, but it could include reloading and repairing. </p>



<p>The developer didn’t go into too much detail, but did state that “we are definitely experimenting” and that many other devs in the studio want this kind of stuff. “So if we can make good gameplay with it, we will definitely look into it,” said Malmborg. </p>

                <p>Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Bloomberg reported</a> that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.</p><p>According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has "taken a larger role" in the company's gaming business recently.</p><p>The Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios.</a> Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">these cuts had to happen because of capitalism. </a></p><p>Microsoft was also planning to charge $80 for new games this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">canceled those plans</a>. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a "healthy business," but this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.</a></p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>Next year is poised to be a big one for Microsoft, as 2026 marks the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo</a>. It's also the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the 30th anniversary of the original Diablo. Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">new information about the company's new console</a> in 2026, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Microsoft will host an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2026</a> where it will show off some of what's coming to Xbox in 2026, but not everything.</p>

			<p>Bungie's first non-Destiny release in more than a decade, Marathon, has had a troubled development, to say the least. On top of the game's original director <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">getting fired from Bungie on allegations of misconduct</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">layoffs at the studio that contributed to delays</a>, rumours of<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/"> internal issues with the project</a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed the game again</a>, it can't seem to go through <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">one closed test (regardless of an NDA requirement)</a> without gameplay from the test leaking.</p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ps4sga/20_minutes_of_new_marathon_gameplay_from_the/">Reddit</a>, five separate gameplay videos pulled from BiliBili show off different elements of the game, including a short clip of the game's intro mission, a mini-puzzle, a look at a sniper rifle we've not seen before, and some PvP gameplay. It's approximately 27 minutes of gameplay altogether, and if you're still on the edge about Marathon, then a check-in with any of these videos might help you make up your mind.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last week, when Bungie confirmed that Marathon <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/">would be released in March 2026, the studio also shared its updated vision for the game</a> and what it wants players to get out of their experience and time spent with Marathon. Some of the new elements introduced, like how the body of a dead player will linger on the battlefield as a sign to other players of danger and opportunity, seem like interesting elements to add to the genre. Though the jury is still out as to whether Bungie's new vision will be able to capture players in a way that the studio and its parent company are certainly hoping. </p>



<p>Bungie may be one of the most storied developers in the video game industry, particularly when it comes to first-person shooters, but with how <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">Destiny 2 has seemingly languished in a state of stagnation that it can't break out of</a>, instead of Marathon feeling like an automatic purchase from players who love Bungie's work, it feels like Bungie needs to prove itself as if it is a new studio again.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it's able to do that, because it would be a disappointing day for the industry if we have to see Bungie go the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-killed-concord-again-after-fans-tried-to-bring-it-back-to-life/">Concord</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The First Trailer For Christopher Nolan’s Odyssey Is Extremely Grim]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-first-trailer-for-christopher-nolans-odyssey-is-extremely-grim-2000655139</link>
            <guid>1390141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>He’s taken on comic books, black holes, and the making of the atom bomb. Now director Christopher Nolan has turned his sights to one of the oldest works of literature in the Western canon. How does the man who brought us <em>The Dark Knight</em> imagine Homer’s<em> The Odyssey</em>? The movie’s first trailer is finally here to give us some initial clues.</p> <p>Sitting at just under two minutes and encompassing plenty of brooding fadeouts set to ominous drums and flutes, the first trailer for <em>The Odyssey</em> briefly shows us Odysseus (Matt Damon) and King Agamemnon (Benny Safdie) after the battle of Troy has finished, and sets the stage for the former’s long and perilous journey home now that the war has ended. From there we get glimpses of the Trojan Horse, the cyclops, the underworld, and other notable elements of the ancient Greek poem.</p>

  <p>Damon as Odysseus speaks about the determination of his men, after years of war, to make it back home. We also catch glimpses of Tom Holland as Telemachus (his son) and Anne Hathaway as Penelope (his wife). Damon speaks with a weary exhaustion that would be captured perfectly by the character-aging-in-real-time meme from the end of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>

 <p>And this version of <em>The Odyssey</em> very much feels like it could be Nolan’s version of that <em>WWII</em> epic, but with a twist. While most great war films focus on the destruction, tragedy, and bravery in the midst of battle, <em>The Odyssey</em> is about what happens when the bloodshed is over, the cost of victory, the price of legacy, and whether those who left can ever truly come home. Nolan’s take on one of literature’s quintessential quest narratives releases July 17, 2026, and it’s probably going to be one worth seeing in IMAX.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-no-margin-on-the-odyssey-g3-gaming-monitor-at-a-record-low-offloading-a-best-seller-for-year-end-2000655044</link>
            <guid>1390138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A $130 gaming monitor is going to create more skepticism than confidence if you don’t look further than the price. A number that low will make people assume it’s a knockoff brand with middling resolution, poor response time, and a short lifespan. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">This $130 gaming monitor on sale at Amazon, however, is a Samsung Odyssey G3</a>, one of the best models from one of the very best manufacturers. All of Samsung’s advanced features designed for peak gaming performance are packed into this compact 24-inch display that’s perfect for a bedroom or dorm room desk setup.</p>
<p>Normally a $200 monitor that’s worth every bit of that original price, the Samsung Odyssey G3 is a total steal at $130. The 27-inch model of the same display might be an even better deal now that it’s marked down to just $140, but this 24-inch model has all of the performance in a slightly smaller size that could be a better fit in a tight area or small gaming station.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6549/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 27″ at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Peak Performance</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 checks off every box possible for anyone shopping for a peak compact gaming monitor. The obvious perks are the 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, both competitive-gamer level metrics that are virtually impossible to find in a $130 display. There’s no lag, no tearing, and no glitching out to stop you from getting the drop on the enemy in a shooter or battle royal.</p>
<p>Also bolstering the Odyssey G3’s elite gaming performance is AMD Radeon FreeSync technology, which locks the monitor and the graphics card of your console or PC into perfect refresh rate sync. Having one outperform the other is how image tearing and blur happen, but with FreeSync even the fastest action comes across flawlessly smooth.</p>
<p>A bonus feature for shooters and action games is the Odyssey G3’s Black Equalizer feature. When turned on, dark areas on the screen get a definite boost of brightness and contrast, eliminating your enemies’ hiding places and averting ambush attacks.</p>



<h2>Flip the Script</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 can swivel, tilt, pivot, and fine-adjust for height, so you can position it in the perfect location for your setup. It can even be turned from landscape to portrait orientation and back whenever you like. If you have a space that’s long on width but short on height, the 3-sided borderless design of the Odyssey G3 allows you to line two of them up side by side to create a seamless, uninterrupted horizontal playing field, or a multi-monitor setup for streaming or work. At just $130 during this Amazon deal, you can buy 2 of the Odyssey G3 displays to create this awesome setup.</p>
<p>The average Amazon reviewer gives the Samsung Odyssey G3 a 4.6-star rating, and it’s no wonder why when you run down the list of specs and perks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The Amazon deal that’s still up and still able to get you the Odyssey G3 in time for Christmas transforms an excellent $200 gaming monitor into a truly unbeatable $130 one.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Displate has denied that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The online marketplace for collectible metal posters, which features a range of licensed art from major brands such as Marvel and Star Wars, came under fire last week after fans spotted what looked like signs of generative AI use in a $149 3D-printed Fulgrim Limited Edition artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fulgrim is one of the most prominent characters in the Warhammer 40,000 setting. As one of the Emperor’s 20 genetically-engineered ‘Primarchs,’ Fulgrim played a key role in The Horus Heresy (the civil war that acts as the foundation of the current setting), and recently returned to the Warhammer 40,000 narrative with a new model and lore as the Daemon Primarch of Chaos god Slaanesh.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/fulgrim-1766412158768.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fulgrim Displate artwork. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue was raised after popular Warhammer 40,000 YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Luetin09/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luetin</a> pulled a promotional post for Displate’s limited run Fulgrim art over concerns that part of the image “looked AI generated.” A circled part of the artwork appeared to contain misaligned geometry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no way of confirming this, so I must underline this remains entirely speculative,” Luetin continued. “But based on just the potential for this, I have removed that post - and until I can get a clear answer one way or the other - I do not currently intend to work with them again in the future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Its very disappointing, as their production of official 40K artwork that I own, and still look excellent on my office wall I would absolutely recommend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If anyone did purchase that image yesterday, I would recommend you to personally evaluate its detail for yourself - and if you felt it necessary cancel or refund.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/screenshot-2025-12-22-135048-1766411463128.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Warhammer 40,000 YouTuber Luetin pulled a promotional post for Displate’s limited run Fulgrim art over concerns that part of the image “looked AI generated.”</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That post ended up doing the rounds within Warhammer 40,000 online communities, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdank/comments/1po5msp/displate_allegedly_used_ai_art_for_their_recent/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">where the artwork was analyzed for signs of gen AI use</a>. Now, Displate itself has addressed the concerns, insisting “no AI was used in the creation of this piece.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Displate/comments/1ppxy6a/displate_official_response_to_fulgrim_limited/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Displate subreddit</a>, company representative WallOverthePlace said the artwork was digitally painted by “one of our top in-house artists as part of our licensed Warhammer project.” The part of the image that had become the focus of the gen AI debate is “a human error that slipped through during the final stages of production.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Displate continued: “the piece went through multiple revisions - including repaints, composition changes, and moving elements around - and a small cut-off edge from an earlier adjustment wasn’t fully repainted before final delivery. That’s on us. Designing a Limited Edition is a long and complex process, but this mistake should have been caught during QC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand why this raised red flags, especially given how strongly fan communities feel about AI, and we take that seriously. Limited Editions are our highest-tier releases and we treat them accordingly. To be completely clear: none of our licensed artworks have been or will be AI-generated. Every Limited Edition we release is created entirely by real artists, either by our internal art team or trusted external collaborators, and held to the highest standards we apply as a company.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Displate called on customers who already have their order of the artwork to get in touch to get a replacement. “You will receive a separate product with the same Limited Edition print run number and the same certificate,” Displate said. ”If you choose to keep the original piece, we completely understand and respect that choice of appreciating this unique variant.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have an order yet to ship will get a corrected version, but it will be sent after the New Year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We appreciate the community holding creators to high standards - that same standard is exactly what we expect of ourselves, and we’re sorry for the confusion this caused,” Displate said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature">The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.

Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of generative AI and its use in entertainment is one of the hottest topics across all industries. This week, IGN reported on video game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-game-awards-strips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-of-game-of-the-year-over-gen-ai-dev-says-placeholder-textures-were-patched-out-after-slipping-through-qa-process">which was stripped of its Game of the Year award by The Indie Game Awards over its use of generative AI</a>. Meanwhile, Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-will-hold-fan-qa-about-dev-processes-following-ai-backlash-and-says-it-will-make-changes-to-processes-that-fail-to-align-with-who-we-are">plans to address concern over its use of gen AI in upcoming game Divinity following a backlash online</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

              <p>Not a fan of big desktop setups? A mini PC can be a perfect alternative. These offer the performance you need, just in a more compact, space-saving form factor. If your workstation is in need of an upgrade, now is a great time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/">The GMKtec mini PC M8 just dropped by 25% at Amazon, which brings its price down to $360.</a> You’re saving a nice $120 on this powerful option that can support both your work and play needs easily. The deal is only around for a short time, though. We’re not expecting it to make it past the weekend, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs Considerable Power</h2>
<p>Starting off with the size – it’s truly compact. It fits into tighter, cluttered spaces without demanding a lot of space, and can even be mounted on a flat surface (under the table, behind the monitor, on the wall) if you’re not a fan of having too many things on your desk.</p>
<p>Performance is nothing short of incredible. M8 runs on an AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650H with 6 cores and 12 threads, hitting base speeds of 3.30GHz and Turbo up to 4.5GHz. It’s made to handle all your everyday tasks – browsing the web, checking emails, streaming shows – plus a few light creative ones without slowing down. Paired with the processor is a powerful AMD Radeon 660M 12 Cores Graphics Card that delivers lag-free performance for moderate gaming, as well as editing and creating. There are three BIOS performance modes to choose from; Quiet 28W, Balance 35W, or Performance 40W.</p>



<p>The modest, yet fast 1<strong>6GB LPDDR5 6400MT/S RAM</strong> keeps things running smoothly on the backend as you push through busy days. It’s not exactly made for heavy-duty multitasking, but holds up well for regular use. You won’t experience noticeable slowdowns when working with a couple of different applications or using a bunch of tabs at the same time. The same goes for back-to-back video calls on busy office days, and some late-night play sessions with friends. Storing everything won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the included <strong>512GB SSD</strong>. Again, it’s not massive, but should be enough to house your important documents, media content, and other files with ease. Additionally, the dual M.2 2280 slots support up to 4TB each, meaning you can expand the space up to 8TB if your storage needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include a versatile USB4 port (40Gbps, PD Charging, Video), USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and more. The HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB4/DP ports let you connect up to three displays at the same time for a bigger, more productive work setup. It’s great for creatives who want to have multiple references open side-by-side, plus gamers looking to stream as they play.</p>

<p>A new job listing suggests that developers could be working on a proper online multiplayer infrastructure for Hogwarts Legacy 2. </p>



<p>Details about Hogwarts Legacy’s highly anticipated sequel have been scarce, with the only thing we know is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is in production</a>. With the amount of success Hogwarts Legacy has witnessed, it would be foolish not to provide it with a sequel. Additionally, with a new game, developers can add features the original game didn’t have, and it seems exactly what they are doing with the online multiplayer. </p>







<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-2-could-be-an-online-multiplayer-rpg">Hogwarts Legacy 2 Could be an ‘Online Multiplayer RPG’</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-competitive-online-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the suggestion that Hogwarts Legacy 2 could feature online multiplayer comes from a new <a href="https://careers.wbd.com/global/en/job/R000101535/Senior-Software-Engineer-Backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Software Engineer at Avalanche Studios. The listing states that they will be welcoming the employee to the team “behind the blockbuster open world, action RPG Hogwarts Legacy.” Additionally, the job description section states that the developer will be working on an “online multiplayer RPG.”</p>



<p>Coming to the requirements section, the listing states that the Senior Software Engineer will be responsible for “Design, implement, and maintain scalable and secure backend services, including player data persistence, matchmaking, lobbies, and server infrastructure.” Some questions remain unanswered, such as whether the whole game features online multiplayer from start to finish or only in some game modes, such as a possible Quidditch mode.</p>







<p>In other news, Hogwarts Legacy has now sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-40-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 40 million copies</a> across all platforms. Additionally, the game received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-support-arrives-with-new-pc-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> earlier this year.

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG Black Budget Closed Alpha ‘Saw More Interest Than Anticipated’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-black-budget-alpha-more-interest/</link>
            <guid>1390096</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON has officially closed the first alpha test for PUBG Black Budget, the upcoming extraction shooter with some mystical, ethereal elements. It’s a perfect combination between a typical extraction title and the battle royale mechanics that the universe is so often associated with, but if you want to play it again, you’ll need to wait a while.</p>



<p>It was said in a recent blog post that the alpha test ‘saw more interest and participation than anticipated’, which is good news for KRAFTON and great news for anyone seeking a new extraction shooter in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-budget-s-alpha-was-a-success">Black Budget’s Alpha Was a Success</h2>



<p>In the post on Steam, the KRAFTON team wrote about the shutdown of the recent closed alpha:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This Closed Alpha Test saw more interest and participation than anticipated, allowing us to gather a wide range of feedback from players.</p>



<p>Through the feedback shared by those who took part, we were able to assess the potential of the game’s atmosphere, visuals, and overall system design.</p>



<p>At the same time, feedback consistently highlighted issues related to combat perception, situational clarity, and fatigue during repeated runs.</p>



<p>In addition, concerns and reports related to unauthorized programs continued to surface during the test period, leading us to progressively strengthen security measures and anti-cheat responses throughout the test.</p>



<p>Some players also experienced technical issues such as game stability problems and crashes. These factors had a noticeable impact on the overall testing experience.</p>



<p>All feedback submitted by players is currently under internal review and analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In our preview piece, penned during the alpha, we predicted that ‘Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.’</p>



<p>It’s a great extraction title, but it’s very similar to what already exists and might not innovate enough to be a real contender in the genre. That said, it played well, looked good, and presented itself as a more accessible alternative to a game like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>At the end of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4077740/allnews?snr=1_620_4_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the team announced a return to Coli Island and Black Budget when the game is ‘in a more refined state’.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 players believe they have discovered evidence that the game features AI-generated art. People are theorizing that some of the art in player emblems in Battlefield 6 was created, at least in part, with the use of generative AI systems, though there is no concrete evidence of this as of yet or any comment from Electronic Arts or the game's developers.</p><p>People have pointed out some apparent irregularities with the art below. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details on the situation.</p><p>Back in October, DICE GM Rebecka Coutaz said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">EA's teams use generative AI in the early stages of development</a> "to allow more time and more space to be creative." But Battlefield 6 has no gen AI-created content, she said. She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p>Developer Fasahat "Fas" Salim said people should not be afraid of generative AI in game development, adding that plans were underway to determine how to best implement the technology into future development pipelines.</p><p>"It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows; how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level," he said.</p><p>Coutaz has also said using generative AI for making games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">"very seducing."</a></p><p>To hear EA developers speak enthusiastically about AI is no big surprise, as the company's other key executives, including CEO Andrew Wilson, have said the tools will help EA in the long run. Wilson has said further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">will lead to job losses, but it will ultimately create more jobs than it displaces over time.</a></p><p>Before this, EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Outside of EA, Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a></p><p>The developers working on Battlefield rival Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">freely admit to using generative AI to aid in the development process.</a></p><p>The debate around AI in games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">reignited recently with Larian boss Swen Vincke's controversial comments.</a> Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-of-the-year-award-stripped-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-over-ai/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">had one of its Game of the Year awards revoked due to AI.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 is 2025's best-selling game of the year so far in the US, even outperforming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>

			<p>Roleplaying games have been on an incredible winning streak lately. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">2024 was a monumental year thanks to the release of some very high-quality games</strong></a>, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/"><strong>2025 has managed to keep that momentum going</strong></a>, proving that we are living in a golden age for RPGs. From long-awaited sequels that finally delivered on a decade of hype to new IPs that left their mark on the genre with involving narratives and engaging gameplay, this year was another filled with quality releases.</p>



<p>Because of this rich release line-up, narrowing this list down to just five games was more difficult than ever. Whether it was the revival of a cult classic, the perfection of a tactical formula, or a sprawling open world that actually felt lived-in, the RPGs of 2025 will be remembered for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is undoubtedly one of the best role-playing games released in the current console generation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out of nowhere. Developed by Sandfall Interactive, an unproven game development studio based in France, the game blew RPG enjoyers all over the world out of the water with its modernization of the classic turn-based JRPG formula.</p>



<p>Featuring one of the best stories and characters in years, a challenging combat system incorporating action game elements for enhanced interactivity, and a soundtrack that makes every sequence memorable,  Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 quickly became a smashing success, its high quality recognized by the entire industry with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/"><strong>Game of the Year award</strong></a> at this year's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>All the praise the game received is absolutely deserved, as I noted in my review: <em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II improves the foundation set by the first entry in the series in every possible way</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite being a little rough around the edges, the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance quickly became the open-world RPG to play for those looking to live a medieval life in a living, breathing digital world. Topping this was a difficult task, but Warhorse Studios not only met expectations but also exceeded them with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p>



<p>The continuation of Henry of Skalitz's story not only impresses with the refinement of many of the mechanics seen in the original, or with the sheer size of the new 15th-century Bohemia map (almost double that of the first game), but with its density. The game is chock-full of little events, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-talks-about-dynamic-npc-routines-and-emergent-storytelling-for-side-quests/"><strong>NPCs' reactions</strong></a>, discoveries, and easter eggs, making it easy to lose oneself in what, to date, is the most lively open-world seen in role-playing games.</p>



<p>In his review of the game, Chris Wray could only praises such an excellent RPG:<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-9">Elden Ring Nightreign (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">9</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is a great example of how to adapt an established formula into something both new and engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>, there was little doubt that the open-world game would become the first entry in a series, much like the original Dark Souls. While a sequel has yet to be announced, the franchise was expanded in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>a rather unexpected way with Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></a>.</p>



<p>On paper, FromSoftware's new foray into a multiplayer-focused experience does not sound particularly compelling, as a shrinking playable zone and resetting character progression seem to be completely antithetical to the Souls series formula. However, this combination of high-speed gameplay, co-op, and roguelite mechanics comes together extremely well, making the game a showcase of how to leverage an established experience to offer something different.</p>



<p>I wasn't really convinced about the game before release, but after playing, I was hopelessly hooked, as I wrote in my review: <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-8-8">Avowed (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Avowed-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Avowed stands as a great role-playing game enhanced by what Obsidian Entertainment does best</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/"><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></a> series, its world of Eora was expanded with Avowed, a first-person role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment to a high standard.</p>



<p>Set in a remote corner of the world to make the experience welcoming for newcomers, Avowed's strength lies in its narrative elements, rooted in the great writing the studio is known for. Gameplay still delivers with <a href="https://wccftech.com/extended-avowed-gameplay/"><strong>solid combat and progression system</strong></a>, but lacks the same vibrancy of other open-world RPGs like The Elder Scrolls series, whose fifth entry Skyrim served as originally inspiration for the game, before its scope was toned down.</p>



<p>All of these elements come together well, making for a marked step forward from The Outer Worlds, as Alessio Palumbo noted in his review: <em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-9-5">Monster Hunter Wilds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Key-Art-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series formula meaningfully with an open-world setting and new combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a>, expectations were high for Monster Hunter Wilds, especially for those who preferred World's approach to the series' gameplay over the much more action-oriented approach of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Although the community feels that these expectations were not met at launch, it's undeniable that Monster Hunter Wilds does most of what it sets out to do well. The open-world setting streamlines some of the series staples without dumbing them down, while the addition of Focus Mode helps hunters target certain monster body parts with every weapon type and makes hunts against some of the best-designed monsters in the series more spectacular than ever with the addition of a Wounds system.</p>



<p>With most of the launch complaints addressed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/"><strong>post-launch updates</strong></a>, Monster Hunter Wilds is now in a better state than at launch, and is now even more worthy of experiencing, as I highlighted in my review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>

<p>As mentioned above, picking only five among the many excellent RPGs released in 2025 was a challenging task.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s first year did come with a new <em>Zelda</em> game, though it’s not necessarily the one diehard fans are waiting for. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> ties directly into the storyline of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but it’s a musou-style hack-and-slash game rather than a traditional <em>Legend of Zelda</em> adventure. Still, the franchise’s producer says some of that action flavor could influence the direction of the next mainline entry.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Age of Imprisonment</em></a> was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo’s AAA Games Studio and the <em>Zelda</em> team at Nintendo, including long-time producer Eiji Aonuma. While AAA Games Studio would lead on designing features and gameplay, the<em> Zelda</em> team would test and give feedback.&nbsp;“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the<em> Zelda</em>-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of&nbsp;<em>musou&nbsp;</em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eiji-aonuma-hints-that-next-zelda-game-will-be-inspired-by-elements-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">translated by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p>

 <p>When Nintendo would raise concerns about something, the Koei Tecmo team would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better,” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi said. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next)<em> Zelda</em> we create,” Aonuma added. “Please picture this while playing <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, and look forward to our <em>Zelda</em>.”</p>

 <p>Is this laying the groundwork for a <em>Devil May Cry</em>-like evolution of the franchise, or is it just Aonuma being cheeky? He noted elsewhere in the interview that his team was hoping to be the first to release a <em>Zelda</em> game for Nintendo’s new hardware but were beaten to it by Koei Tecmo. “<em>The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment</em> is the first <em>Zelda</em> title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (<em>Zelda</em> game on the new console),” he reportedly chuckled.</p>

 <p>In his mind, at least, it’s clear<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> is a true<em> Zelda</em> game and not just another <em>Warriors</em> spin-off. From a story point of view, it’s understandable why. Anyone wanting to get the full picture of the events from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> would need to have experienced it and the previous <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&nbsp;</em>as well. Will the next<em> Zelda</em> game return to that world, or break the mold and start off someplace new in the <em>Zelda</em> timeline? <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> didn’t get any DLC so hopefully that means we’ll find out the answer sooner than expected.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/">The Indie Game Awards</a>, a usually delightful and low-controversy annual celebration of the best of indie games in a given year, has found itself having to retract three different awards handed out in last week’s event, including its Game of the Year prize. That originally went to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, which also won Best Debut Indie, both already controversial choices given <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">the game is not “indie” by pretty much every understanding of the term</a>, but was withdrawn on the allegation that the developers, Sandfall Interactive, were not honest about the game’s use of AI when it was submitted. The other retraction is for an Indie Vanguard recognition of a Game Boy-like game that is only available on weapons dealer Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro devices.</p> <p>A big part of the IGAs, organized by Six One Indie, are its progressive values and its desire to support the indie scene in a positive way, making its intentions and selections potentially different from those of other award ceremonies out there. One of those values is to not endorse games made using so-called “generative AI” tools. In a video posted to BlueSky over the weekend, Six One’s Mike Towndrow stated that Sandfall told the IGAs that no gen-AI had been used in the creation of <em>Clair Obscur</em>, only admitting that in fact it had been on the day of the awards. (We have reached out to Sandfall and owners Kepler to ask for their side of events.)</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/app.bsky.feed.post/3magufzccy22i" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwdw5iwm2iojwzodusm5l6taqldvuqpnuyrc2miidgks6zhwflz4"> <p lang="en">The IGAs Nomination Committee is officially retracting Debut Game and Game of the Year, awarding both categories to new recipients. Additionally, we are retracting one of the Indie Vanguard recipients.</p> <p>Full details can be found in our FAQ under Game Eligibility: www.indiegameawards.gg/faq</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti?ref_src=embed">The Indie Game Awards (@indiegameawards.gg)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/post/3magufzccy22i?ref_src=embed">2025-12-20T18:45:10.232Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>In a statement posted to the IGA’s FAQ, the point is reiterated.</p> <blockquote><p><span>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> from its nomination. While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</span></p></blockquote> <p>As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> has been given the Game of the Year award, while Debut Game goes to à la mode games’ <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We’re Closed</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>The other rescinded award is one of the IGA’s Indie Vanguard selections, <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Gortyn Code</a>,<span>&nbsp;a Greek indie developer which made a Game Boy game called&nbsp;<em>Chantey</em>. However, since the announcement, the IGA team learned that the game’s physical card is only being produced and sold by ModRetro, a retro gaming company owned by Oculus-founding billionaire Palmer Luckey, who also runs the arms-dealing Anduril Industries. And to make sure there was no ambiguity left, <a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">it announced the Anduril Chromatic</a>, a retro gaming device made from the same metal used to build the company’s military drones.</span></p>

 <p>In the IGA’s FAQ it’s stated, “<span>The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console. As the company strictly goes against the values of the IGAs. [sic] Due to the ties with ModRetro, Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.”</span></p>

 <p>However, it goes on to add that “<span>the decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone. Chantey remains a wonderful throwback to the Game Boy era,” encouraging people to seek out the game via its <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Itch.io page</a>, where it can be played.</span></p>

 <p>Some might argue they would prefer their award organizers not allow ideological positions to determine their criteria, and those people will be able to take comfort in the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">this is the case</a> for almost every other ceremony out there, while recognizing that the IGAs are independently owned and run by Six One Indie, which can do whatever it pleases. You can watch all the original announcements for the IGAs in the video below, for which replacement acceptance speeches will be recorded by the new winners.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Listen up, extraction fans. Battlestate Games has just announced the commencement of a new Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops event, set to run from today, December 22, to January 4. The action kicks off today at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST, and it’s set to award viewers with all kinds of in-game items.</p>



<p>In a blog post, the team at Battlestate Games confirmed that in-game items and unlockable containers are <strong>guaranteed </strong>to be secured by <strong>all </strong>viewers watching <strong>any </strong>Tarkov streamer.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-tarkov-drops-event-end">When Does The Tarkov Drops Event End?</h2>



<p>You’ll have plenty of time over the festive window and into the new year to unlock the latest round of rewards in Escape from Tarkov. The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">all-new blog post</a> confirmed that the event <strong>ends </strong>at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST on January 4.</p>



<p>Here’s the need-to-know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Drops will be activated on the channels of ALL Twitch streamers without exception who will be broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category.</p>



<p>Drops – in-game items</p>



<p>During the campaign, at certain intervals, you will be guaranteed to receive an unlockable container, which are categorized by the rarity of the contents – Common, Rare and Epic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s more important is that this Drops event is accessible to <strong>all players</strong>, even those on the PvE platform. This has been a point of contention in recent months, with users exclusive to the PvE mode feeling ‘cheated’ by PvP players getting more bang for their buck.</p>



<p>But the developers at Battlestate Games have stressed that they’ll be ‘doing more’ for PvE players moving forward, especially as they make up a fair portion of the game’s player base.</p>



<p>Here are the rules for the Twitch Drops campaign:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drops can be earned by users who have an active copy of the game</li>



<li>To receive or enable Drops, both the viewer and the streamer need to attach their Twitch account to their game profile on the project’s website. You can do this&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.tarkov.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></li>



<li>You can watch one or more broadcasts, but viewing time for rewards will only count if those broadcasts are participating in the event</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>2025 brought us Switch 2, of course, but it's been a very strong year across the board, with exceptional games of all sizes on all platforms - and an absolute <em>ton</em> of them. Perhaps the knock-on effects of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">layoffs</a> taking out huge swathes of the industry haven't quite hit the pipeline, but this year we've once again had more brilliant games than time to play them all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The future may be uncertain, but the breadth of quality on Switch 1 and 2 this year is undeniable, so let's take a moment to celebrate that. We've got 25 games below, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong>, with comments from the pickees (yep, making it a word), plus a chunky list of honourable mentions to finish.</p>
<p>Let us know your personal favourites in the usual place, and <strong>keep an eye out for our reader-ranked top 50 very soon</strong>.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Quite a few roguelikes have sucked me into their ‘one more run’ trappings this year, but none have held me in a chokehold like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. After bouncing off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, it was Absolum’s simplicity that first pulled me in — its beat-‘em-up controls and Saturday-morning-cartoon visuals making the whole thing feel very un-busy in a way that completely worked for me.</p>
<p>That simplicity hides a wonderful depth beneath, and I was soon crafting builds specifically designed with an end goal in mind. The thing that kept me coming back for more, however, was how the game sells that fantasy of “next time, I’ll do better”. Every run feels like a step in the right direction, every upgrade feels like a game-changer, and, to top it all off, there’s a frog…who’s a wizard. Come on, what’s not to like? - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+ (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>'90s TV sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo</a> would fall apart if just one aspect wasn't <em>perfectly</em> realised. From the technical side, something as notionally simple as CRT static or signal distortion can be difficult to get right, but it's just one tick on a long checklist that the devs absolutely nail.</p>
<p>The interstitial graphics and links are <em>spot-on</em>. The editing, phenomenal. The writing, wonderfully subtle. The set design, transportative. The camera work, impeccable. Performances, inspired. Audio, fantastic. [<em>Feature here</em>], [<em>Strong adjective here</em>]. And it all comes together in this perfect time capsule of late 20th-century TV broadcasting.</p>
<p>Don't, whatever you do, go into it expecting a game, but this is one of the most ambitious projects to come out this year on Switch or anywhere else. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>A late-releasing entry, Wombat Brawler's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is a game about taking it slow, casting a line, and fishing some fish. The pixel art is quite possibly the best in any game I've played, and the loop, although simple, manages to keep you engaged with its many baits, rods, and fish to be caught.</p>
<p>If you need something after a long and stressful day, this is the right game for you. - <em>FS</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I headed into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> with very little idea of what to expect. I like TTRPGs and all things sci-fi, but I hadn’t played the first game, and everything looked a bit…texty. After making my first few decisions, picking up crewmates, risking their lives, and having rather stern words with those back on a nearby space station, I knew that this would end up sitting high on my GOTY list.</p>
<p>The music is phenomenal, the storytelling is sublime, and the characters — the characters! — well, I haven’t felt this protective over a bunch of NPCs in years. I achieved the exact ending I hoped for for my Sleeper, the one I worked so hard to put into place, and I was still an emotional wreck as the credits rolled. A stunning game, through and through. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><del>Cyberpunk is the best game what the hell is wrong with the rest of you?</del></p>
<p>There’s nothing quite like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2. It’s gritty, it’s dirty, it’s shiny, it’s clean, it’s a living, breathing world that casts a very unflattering reflection of our own. It’s got a belting cast of characters, intense action sequences, and some real heartache. Just be warned, if you’re hoping for a happy ending: wrong city, wrong people. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>After previewing, reviewing, and building a guide campaign for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I have put over 100 hours into this 25-hour platforming adventure. And do you know what? I’d do it all over again. I struggle to think of another 2025 game that <em>feels</em> this good, or that has put this big a smile on my face. DK, you Rool. - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If anyone asks you why they should consider getting a Switch 2 right now, this exclusive is probably <em>the</em> main reason. It’s the exact kind of platforming experience you want to see showcasing new Nintendo hardware. I’m even happy to overlook the slight performance issues during certain boss encounters, as DK's latest outing is a smashing good time from start to finish. - <em>LD</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It’s hard to play Bananza without a massive grin on your face. It’s colourful, dynamic, open, and comes coupled with some absolutely banging tracks to enjoy as you blast through the endless swathes of destructible environments. - <em>AO</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Weirdly, every time I go back to DKB (the final boss was tricky, so I returned to previous layers to find more ooo-bananas), I've liked it a <em>little</em> less. But it made such an impact in July that it still makes my top five with its boundless beans and boldness. It channels the quality you'd expect from the Odyssey team into something pleasingly, almost wrecklessly different. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Despite releasing way back in January, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a> has been ever-present in my mind – even in a year stuffed full of fantastic Metroidvanias. Taking everything good about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and fine-tuning it, including better combat, fantastic traversal skills, excellent bosses, and a refined skill system, makes for a near-perfect experience in my mind.</p>
<p>Tonally, as well, Ender Magnolia has its own identity, a level of melancholia blended with dark steampunk. The characters help bring a little levity to the adventure. But this is a world I could gladly wallow (or delight) in for a long time. Whatever Adglobe and Live Wire do next, I’ll be there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, but the buzz surrounding Level-5’s long-awaited sequel could not escape me. And my goodness, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> had a <em>grip</em> on me. Outside of an MMORPG, I don’t think I’ve ever played a game so stuffed full of content that also feels completely coherent. A game that should be completely overwhelming, yet is so relaxed and easy to digest.</p>
<p>Level-5’s return over these past two years has been a joy to watch, and I’m so glad we’re seeing more from the team. I still occasionally dip into Ginomorsia for a few minutes just to run around, level up some lives, and live a carefree life doing stuff. It’s just a great escape, one that I‘m excited to lose more time to when the DLC comes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Come on, this is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, the greatest SRPG ever made. I still feel this way after playing The Ivalice Chronicles, which elevates an all-timer thanks to some incredible voice acting. Joe Pitts and Gregg Lowe deserve all of the accolades for bringing humanity and depth to Ramza and Delita. The gameplay tweaks also help smooth out some of the rougher edges. Basically, this is a must-play, in my eyes. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My favourite Final Fantasy? Indeed it is, and in this Ivalice Chronicles edition, it sings like never before. I have no issue with the missing War of the Lions content in all honesty, having personally preferred the remixed narrative here, and they also tweaked and polished, and added vital stuff like new difficulty levels, whilst nailing the graphical enhancements. A stunner! - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t think Supergiant Games could bring anything new to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> formula, but now I’ve played over 100 hours of this, I can tell you, I was <em>very</em> wrong. The gameplay variety here is astounding: each of the six weapons feels unique, with every aspect requiring a completely different build. I’m also a big fan of some of the new boons, especially Apollo and Hera who I’m always begging to get on every run.</p>
<p>I have some qualms with the story, and the various currencies may be a bit much, but it hasn’t dulled my love for Supergiant's output. I’ll buy everything they release, because they know how to make an exceptional game. Hades II is no exception. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>My hype levels were high for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> (like, real high), and, miraculously, Team Cherry managed to live up to them. I am, historically, very bad with Soulslike mechanics, but finally beating that High Halls gauntlet after throwing multiple hours at it, oof, there’s no feeling quite like it! - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have a lot to say about Silksong, so I’ll say it elsewhere - look out for a feature! But my worries about this sequel not living up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> were unfounded; I’m <em>desperate</em> to play it again. And again. It makes me sad I’ll never get to experience my first steps into the Citadel or finally defeating the true final boss again. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As far as Metroidvanias go, this is so up at the top of the list it’s hard to see it from all the way down here. It’s <em>brutally</em> difficult, and absolutely not one for those who can’t handle unfiltered rage, but there are few games more satisfying. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>As a diehard Musou fan, I am always ready to jump in and defend the genre against its many naysayers. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, I genuinely, for the first time, don't even feel the need to bother. You can say what you want, mate. This is deep, addictive, and wonderfully fun action fare that looks and performs a doozy on Switch 2.</p>
<p>They've been close with a few entries in the past, but this is the first Warriors game where Switch performance, alongside combat enhancements and, lest we forget, that official nod from Nintendo on the lore front, all marry to make for something I'd unreservedly recommend to any action game fan. - <em>PJ</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I really wanted to get into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> when it was released on Switch 1, but I wasn’t sold on the game's performance. Fortunately, Age of Imprisonment does a much better job in this department (bumping the action up to 60fps, for the most part), and in terms of the gameplay, it’s one of Koei Tecmo’s best Musou games to date. - <em>LD</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of Llamasoft, so it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a> resonated so much. While technically a remake of the 1984 original from Dave Theurer, Jeff Minter’s latest creation is a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>Blending deceptively simple gameplay with mind-melting psychedelic visuals, it's a joy to behold, and a game that simply begs to be replayed as you strive for the global leaderboards. I hesitate to use the phrase “there’s nothing else quite like it,” but screw it: There’s nothing else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Didn’t Predict It, But Rather A Future I Didn’t Desire’: Hideo Kojima Reflects on AI and the Haunting Legacy of Metal Gear Solid 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-didnt-predict-it-but-rather-a-future-i-didnt-desire-hideo-kojima-reflects-on-ai-and-the-haunting-legacy-of-metal-gear-solid-2/</link>
            <guid>1390039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In many ways, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was a game decades ahead of its time. Originally released in 2001, the title remained misunderstood for years, largely due to its controversial protagonist switch and a narrative that seemed to mirror its own predecessor excessively.</p>



<p>However, over the years, players have reevaluated the game as a chilling prophecy. Hideo Kojima appeared to predict a world where social media, information overload, and AI-driven control would reshape the fabric of society. Yet, according to the creator himself, this wasn't an act of prediction, but a warning.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA"><strong>In a new interview with Wired</strong></a>, Hideo Kojima was asked about AI gaining more control in the real world, just as seen in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and if he predicted that this era would come. <em>'Metal Gear Solid 2 is about digital society. In digital society, everything is preserved. It wasn't about AI, but interweaving digital data gaining a will of its own. When everyone is connected and exchanging opinions instantly, how does life change?"</em> Kojima-san explained.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I didn't predict it, but rather a future I didn't desire,"</em> the legendary game creator concluded with a sobering thought.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hideo Kojima Answers Hideo Kojima Questions | Tech Support | WIRED" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02Ah5VQrzvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Despite his modesty, many remain unconvinced that Kojima doesn't possess a certain "prophetic" edge. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding</strong></a>, for instance, famously launched just months before the COVID-19 pandemic turned its themes of isolation and "hero couriers" into a global reality, themes that were further expanded in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</strong></a></p>



<p>As Kojima moves forward with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/if-you-watch-the-od-trailer-many-times-theres-a-hint-says-kojima-we-built-new-medium/"><strong>experimental horror project OD</strong></a> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/">so experimental Kojima-san doesn't know if it will work</a></strong>) and his return to "Espionage Action" with Physint (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">which is still very early in development</strong></a>), we have to wonder: which part of our future is he warning us about now? Are you excited, or perhaps a little terrified, to see what he anticipates next? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Crafted for portability, the JBL Grip is designed to travel with you. Its IP67 rating means it’s both waterproof and dustproof, so you can take it anywhere—even to the beach, pool, or through rainy conditions—without worrying about damage. The speaker’s tough, fabric-covered exterior adds durability, while the rubber casing helps protect it from minor impacts. Plus, the speaker features impressive battery life, offering up to 12 hours of continuous playback on a single charge.

Choose from eye-catching hues like red, blue, green, purple, or teal, or go for the unique camo design if you want something special. For a more understated look, it’s also available in neutral tones like white and black. However, if you go for the camo style, just be cautious when using it outdoors—you wouldn’t want to lose track of it in the grass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is one of my most surprising titles of 2025. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMO that’s reminiscent of STALKER, Fallout 76, and in some ways, Escape from Tarkov. There’s plenty of potential wrapped up in a very ambitious package, which has been assembled by GFA Games, a small studio presenting this inaugural title to an eager audience.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing PIONER for some time, having participated in the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous playtests</a> through 2025. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the game’s early access release, but now that it’s here, I’m having a blast, racking up the hours, and finding myself <strong>very excited </strong>to see where this game goes.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full PIONER review and learn why this is one of my must-watch titles going into 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-pioner-all-about">What’s PIONER All About?</h2>



<p>In PIONER, players find themselves waking up on the island of Tartarus, a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mutated enemies, mystical anomalies, and warring factions. It’s a bit overwhelming at first, but there’s a neat tutorial that adjusts your expectations accordingly within a couple of hours.</p>



<p>You’ll come to learn that PIONER is spread across several maps that constitute the full island. Each one represents a ‘biome’ that is drastically different from those that came before, and you can travel between them at will.</p>



<p>As you explore this game, you’ll meet faction leaders, build relationships, level up your character, assign skill points, and take part in a wealth of events. There are boss fights, raids, world events, PvP arenas, and a core story to follow.</p>



<p>It’s easy for me to say there’s plenty of meat on PIONER’s bones, and it doesn’t end with the base game, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">GFA plans to expand</a> the title <strong>very soon </strong>via a live-service operating model.</p>



<p>There’s a pretty tough difficulty curve in the game, which boasts some light survival mechanics, but once you’ve found your groove and secured some good equipment, you’ll be much more comfortable.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-thing-about-pioner-is-the-depth">The Best Thing About PIONER is the DEPTH</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks brilliant, and the STALKER influences are very obvious</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER has so much to see and do, despite being on the smaller side of what you might expect from an MMO. It’s important to stress that this is an evolving game that has launched in early access; don’t come here if you’re expecting perfection.</p>



<p>With that being said, there are some optimization issues. I’ve had network problems, some inventory-related blips, issues with hit registration, and some clipping, but it’s nothing game-breaking, and the team <strong>always </strong>seems to be aware of what’s going on. This is a very community-led thing, and that’s immediately made obvious if you spend any time at all in the game’s Discord server.</p>



<p>Anyway, back to the depth.</p>



<p>As I explored PIONER’s varied environments, I found side quests popping up ad hoc, and uncovering the new locations highlighted on the map with question marks yielded even more content every time. There’s a great looter-shooter loop that allows you to fill your boots with resources quite easily, which will keep you occupied for some time.</p>



<p>There’s a regular rotation of world events, daily challenges keep you in quick rewards, and there’s a noticeboard in the game’s central hub that allows you to unlock time-bound missions at the press of a button.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to the core story, achievements, challenges, and general open-endedness of the game.</p>



<p>Oh, and there’s a PvP function built on a session-based, arena-driven model that means you can get a taste of PvP without worrying about being griefed in the main world. <strong>But </strong>with that being said, GFA <strong>does plan </strong>to introduce PvP-based maps to accommodate the more bloodthirsty players out there.</p>



<p><strong>And if that wasn’t enough</strong>…</p>



<p>There are puzzle challenges, speedrun courses, minigames, and collectibles to uncover all over the world. Nothing feels like a waste of time, which is really nice.</p>



<h2 id="h-now-to-see-how-long-it-lasts">Now to See How Long it Lasts</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fans of Fallout will LOVE PIONER</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER is an MMO, and that means it relies solely on players to remain fuelled and in development. It has a premium price point that’s a bit more accessible than most games, plus there’s a microtransaction-backed economy baked into the game.</p>



<p>But without players feeding the flow, PIONER might struggle to leave early access.</p>



<p>GFA Games has planned a console release for the game, which would broaden the title’s horizons, but there’s no indication of when that’ll drop.</p>



<p>This might sound negative, but it’s more pragmatic. I’m already a fan of PIONER and everything it wants to accomplish, and I believe the developers have the chops to get it done. There’s a phenomenal post-apocalyptic palette within PIONER, and the groundwork has been laid for expansions, which is brilliant.</p>



<p>Sure, some of the animations are a little janky, there are bugs present that might make your experience a little skewed, and it’s not fully optimized for all builds, but if you know what you’re getting into, you can’t be surprised. For an early access game from a small studio that has never released a thing, this is a <strong>hugely ambitious MMO with bite</strong>.</p>



<p>I needed a new Fallout 76 to occupy my time after spending 500 hours in that title’s endgame, and along came PIONER.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>PIONER represents something special. It’s a refreshing, honest attempt to build something extremely ambitious in a world dominated by some immense entities. If GFA Games can iron out the kinks and keep on a steady course out of early access, this could be a hidden gem of the post-apocalyptic space.</p>



<p>I was surprised by how good this game is, and beyond this review, I can guarantee I’ll spend <strong>a lot of time </strong>grinding away at it. This MMO has untold potential, and I’m truly hopeful it stands the test of time.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to give PIONER a try. The game is available <strong>exclusively </strong>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam in early access</a>.</p>

                <p>In the span of a week, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was named Game of the Year by both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-watch-the-indie-game-awards-2025-and-all-the-award-nominees/1100-6536993/" data-ref-id="1100-6536993">The Indie Game Awards</a>. But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI.</p><p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," reads a statement on <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Indie Game Awards' official site</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p><p>Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a> as its new Game of the Year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sorry-were-closed/" data-ref-id="5000-540223">Sorry We're Closed</a> was given the award for Debut Game, which Expedition 33 previously claimed.</p><p>During a feature run on <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">El Pais</a> in July 2025, Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse said, "We use some AI, but not much. The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do." Following the release of that article, Sandfall Interactive released the following statement:</p><p>"The studio states that it was in contact with El Pais on April 25--three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence."</p><p>Additionally, Sandfall states that the only AI-created assets in the game were placed as "temporary placeholder textures" that were missed during Expedition 33's QA process. Once the assets were identified, they were "removed within five days" and replaced by the intended textures.</p><p>So far, the controversy doesn't seem to have dimmed Expedition 33's popularity. The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/president-of-france-takes-a-turn-congratulating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/1100-6536961/" data-ref-id="1100-6536961">congratulated Sandfall</a> for its success at The Game Awards.

			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> is a fantastic game in its own right, as exemplified by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review scores</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prizes it's starting to win now</a> that the award season is in full swing, but it's all the more impressive because of Sandfall Interactive's small size. The French studio famously only has around 33 (yes, like the game) developers, and we also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that they made this gem <strong>with a budget of under $10 million</strong>.</p>



<p>As one of the biggest game releases of 2025 (according to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final 2025 Alinea Analytics report</a>, the game reached <strong>8.6 million players</strong>, almost a million more than Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly gives the studio the opportunity to scale up in size. However, in an interview <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Knowledge</a>, EDGE's free newsletter dedicated to the games industry, Sandfall Interactive founder, CEO, and Creative Director Guillaume Broche said <strong>there's no such plan</strong> despite the game performing 'a hundred times better' than they had anticipated, and he also explained why.</p>



<p><em>No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves. We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.</em></p>



<p>It is definitely rare to see a game development studio getting the chance to expand and not take it. It may seem like an unusual choice at first, but it could prove extremely wise in the long run. By staying small, Sandfall won't be forced to follow the 'bigger is better' mentality, and it could also more easily cope with unsuccessful projects if need be. History shows that studios that double or even triple their size after a successful game can get into a lot of trouble if their next project goes wrong for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a substantial free update as a thank-you to the community, adding a new playable environment, new Luminas and weapons, a photo mode, and AMD FSR 4 support on PC, among other things. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-offloads-airtags-at-a-record-low-not-just-airpods-and-macbooks-in-a-surprise-year-end-clearance-2000655042</link>
            <guid>1390006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why are the stocking stuffers always the last thing on everybody’s holiday list? Small gifts can be the best ones, especially when they’re amazingly useful and at near-all-time low prices,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> like this 4-pack of Apple AirTags that’s on sale at Amazon for 34% off and will still arrive in time for Christmas if you order now.</a></p>
<p>Being stocking-sized is only a small part of the appeal for this deal. Normally a $99 buy, a 4-pack of AirTags for just $65 is a major score, and if you’re a devoted Apple fan or even just an iPhone user, the AirTags are by far the best Bluetooth trackers. They’re compact, exceptionally easy to set up, are powered by an easy-to-find replaceable battery, and help you find lost items with amazing precision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4-Pack Covers It All</h2>
<p>One 4-pack of Apple AirTags can cover a huge swath of the items you need to keep tabs on. There is a huge range of inexpensive AirTag holders that fit keychains, along with holders for wallets and even wallets and money clips that have built-in AirTag holders. Backpacks and other bags are even easier — just drop in an AirTag and let it do the work for you. With your iPhone or iPad handy, you’ll have a location on your valuables at all times.</p>
<p>AirTags have become indispensable travel accessories too. Most major airlines have some form of luggage tracking app or service, but to be&nbsp;<em>really</em> sure of where your bags are, an AirTag slipped into an inner compartment is the best method. Distance is no issue, since the AirTags connect to Apple’s massive Find My network, which is able to ping off of nearby Apple devices — without compromising your privacy or safety — to locate your item whether it’s tens or thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Finding far closer objects — the wallet or keys that slid between couch cushions or slipped under a car seat — is fast and easy with the Find My app. The app gives you directions and distances down to the inch, and you can also make the AirTag play a chime to help you narrow down the search.</p>



<h2>Tough Little Tracker</h2>
<p>The AirTag is IP67-rated for dust and water exposure, and the outer shell is tough enough to endure the knocks and drops that come with being attached to a keychain or the outside of a backpack. The battery is good for roughly a year, and the FindMy app on your iOS device will let you know when it’s time to get a fresh battery. When that time comes, the CR2032 disc battery is one of the most common and easy to find batteries, and the AirTag is easy to open. A quick few seconds later, your AirTag is ready to go for another year.</p>
<p>Not many people are going to put AirTags on their holiday gift list, but anyone who finds a 4-pack of these top-tier Bluetooth trackers in their stocking will be very pleasantly surprised. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">The 4-pack of Apple AirTags on sale at Amazon for just $65 is a thoughful and exceptionally useful gift idea</a>, and if you order now they’ll still make it in time for Christmas.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ark 2 Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2020</p>
      </div>
<p>Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.</p><p>Snail Games also confirmed that 4 million copies of Ark: Survival Ascended have been sold in the two years since it first launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>First announced in 2020, Ark 2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2023, but it was delayed to 2024. After missing that date, the studio has largely kept quiet about progress on the game. Vin Diesel is aiding development on the game--and starring in it--under the fancy role of "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vin-diesel-will-not-only-star-in-ark-2-hes-also-an-executive-producer/1100-6485514/">president of creative convergence</a>" at Studio Wildcard.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-animated-series-with-impressive-voice-cast-gets-surprise-release-out-now/1100-6522008/">The game has also been adapted into an animated series</a> that debuted last year without much fanfare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-the-animated-series-part-2-finally-gets-a-release-window/1100-6536005/">and the second part of Ark: The Animated Series</a> will arrive in 2026.</p>
