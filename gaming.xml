              <p><span>Gaming executive Larry Hyrb, aka Major Nelson, has revealed this week that he’s out at the game engine maker Unity. The Xbox veteran joined as Director of Community and Advocacy only a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span>“After nearly three decades of making an impact at Microsoft, I joined Unity in 2024. During my time there, I rebuilt their Community and Advocacy Team with a deliberate strategy that created a clearer, more connected experience for creators, developers, and gamers,” Hyrb </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hryb_ive-always-been-transparent-with-this-community-activity-7416864352840085504-MDJc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACLzsjMBiEcKGm66u9szH_XVpdQ1NU1SZcQ"><span>explained on LinkedIn</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hyrb continued: “We brought energy back to channels that had gone quiet, restored trust, and showed up consistently where it mattered. I elevated Unity’s visibility at PAX and key industry events, strengthened relationships, and ensured Unity had a clear voice in the broader conversation.”</span></p>   <p><span>It’s not exactly clear when Hyrb was laid off or if the departure is part of a bigger wave of fresh cuts at the software company. “I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships,” he said on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me/post/3mccuyabbv22d"><span>BlueSky</span></a><span>. “I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Major Nelson was previously an important public figure within the Xbox community. He spent almost 23 years at Microsoft, fostering the Xbox Live community and promoting the Xbox 360’s user-facing features, including the Achievement system, cloud saves, in-game messaging, and party chat.</span></p>

  <p><span>He left </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-official-podcast-microsoft-1850642324"><span>Microsoft back in 2023</span></a><span>, a move that preceded Xbox’s pivot to being multiplatform and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886"><span>broader marketing strategy</span></a><span> that didn’t have a single piece of hardware at its center. The brand hasn’t been as public facing, let alone as community-first, since Hyrb’s departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unity has had a rough several years. In 2023, Unity announced that it would install a new Runtime Fee, but was eventually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405"><span>reversed due to immense backlash from developers</span></a><span>. A few months later, then CEO </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-john-riccitiello-ea-intall-fee-resign-fifa-madden-1850914295"><span>John Riccitiello stepped down</span></a><span>. In 2024, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254"><span>Unity laid off a massive chunk of its workforce</span></a><span>, eliminating around 1,800, or 25%, of its employees. Last year, Unity then </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails"><span>laid off its Behavior team</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals Deadpool can play 3 roles: Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist, and you can choose which role you want to play. </p>



<p>Season 6 of Marvel Rivals, Night at the Museum, is all set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-6-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kick off</a> on January 16, 2026, and it will finally bring the most anticipated character to the game, Deadpool. The developers have now released their Dev Vision Vol. 13, which goes over the new characters along with all the new content and changes coming to Marvel Rivals Season 6. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-deadpool-features-3-roles-in-one">Marvel Rivals Deadpool Features 3 Roles in One </h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dev Vision Vol. 13</a> started very differently from the previous Marvel Rivals dev diary. In the most Deadpool fashion, the Merc with the Mouth stepped into Guangguang’s role and walked us through his character details himself. Deadpool first addressed the complaints about the game not having enough Vanguard and Strategists, revealing that he is the solution, as Deadpool can play as a Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist in Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Deadpool features Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas, allowing him to battle the enemies at range and up close and take up the Duelist role. As a Vanguard, the character has a unicorn plushie that can give out shields. Lastly, the Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas can not only damage enemies but also heal allies when shooting at them as a Strategist. </p>



<p>Additionally, Deadpool in Marvel Rivals can level up while the battle goes on until he becomes a “true server admin”, no matter which role you pick. The character’s ultimate ability charges faster depending on “how fancy” the player fights, which leads to a challenge to other players. Depending on how the players answer Deadpool’s questions, the character will receive a huge buff according to the role he is playing.  </p>

            <guid>1404970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War has been in hibernation since 2017, and its most recent installment was far from universally well-received. So when King Art Games was handed the task of bringing it back, there were a lot of tricky decisions to navigate and an eager but picky fanbase to face. We recently got to chat with Creative Director Jan Theysen and Senior Game Designer Elliott Verbiest about how the team is calling the shots. (Read on or watch the video interview below.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was King Art's previous game, Iron Harvest, that seemed to catch the attention of someone at Games Workshop. And it's not too difficult to see why, if you look at its big, stompy robots.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we were working on Iron Harvest, our previous game, an RTS game as well," Theysen recalled. "And that was a Kickstarter game. So we were very open about the development and we showed a lot of stuff we can do with the engine and what we do in terms of art and so on. And as someone at Games Workshop must have seen that and they basically contacted us and asked, 'If we were doing Dawn of War 4, what would you do, basically?' And so we made a little pitch and we sent them over our ideas and the presentation and we didn't really hear back from them a lot. And so we basically thought, okay, that's it, right? It's like, cool that they asked us, basically. And then when Iron Harvest came out and was successful, they basically came back and said, 'Okay, let's talk about it for real.' But you can't really believe it, right? Yeah, well, okay, now they're asking us, but in reality, we're not going to make Dawn of War 4. And then slowly but surely it becomes more realistic and you don't really dare to believe it, right? And then at some point you sign the contract and it's like, holy… it's there. We're doing it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many, myself included, Dawn of War was the gateway to the whole Warhammer 40K universe. And King Art hopes this next installment might be as well. It's a sprawling and… sometimes convoluted setting, so that's not exactly a straightforward task.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's funny because we hear that a lot, right?" Theysen agreed. "And that was also one of the big things for Dawn of War 4, that a lot of people say, 'Okay, Dawn of War, yes, that was like the first time I really interacted with Warhammer.' And so for us, it was very important to basically make a Dawn of War 4 that is of course for fans, but also a potential entry point for someone who's new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah. I think I remember basically how I felt when I played Dawn of War for the first time and it was like, okay, super cool, but also I don't understand a lot, right? But I understood enough so the game was fun. It was not like I had to know what all the different weapons do or something like that. It was more like, okay, I can figure it out.  And I think that is also the approach we take for Dawn of War 4, which is basically without any prior knowledge of Warhammer, you still need to understand what the factions are about, what the units are about. You won't understand all the different weapons and equipment and all of that, but it's fine, you can figure it out."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the brutal, aggressive Orks as an example, the goal with the design of the whole faction is that you should naturally be able to figure out how to play without knowing a ton about their lore or having to have it spelled out for you. But those of us who have been living part of our lives in this universe for years should still have stuff to get excited about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We don't really tell the players, if you play Orks, you should have a lot of units and a lot of buildings and just have this explosive expansion," Theysen explained. "It just kind of feels natural to play that way, right? Because buildings are cheap, units are cheap, you lose a lot, so you build a lot ... We make sure that even if the people don't know what Orks are about, they can still play them correctly, basically."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's actually one of the main appeals for the Warhammer 40K universe is that enormous breadth and depth of things that you can potentially learn," Verbiest added. "It's definitely one of the things that attracted me to it was that, okay, sure, of course there is a surface level understanding of it that you can introduce to the games, for example, through a story or a campaign that kind of gets you into that world essentially. But there's so much more to it. And I think that that promise of, hey, there's much more going on beneath the surface, I think is what attracts so many fans to it. And I think that's also how you can serve both fans old and new is that you introduce a story, something to help onboard players into this world, but you have enough detail and other things within that, that signal to more established, more veteran fans of the universe, hey, we are aware of this and we speak the same language. We have the same understanding here."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Deciding what Dawn of War 4 was going to be in context of the previous entries was a judgment call all its own.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But even within the Dawn of War envelope, there are different players bringing different expectations to the table. Dawn of War 1 was more of a traditional basecraft RTS. Dawn of War 2 put the focus more on upgrading a few elite squads, almost like an RPG. And Dawn of War 3 was… well, I try not to think about it too much. But even it had its fans, apparently. So deciding what Dawn of War 4 was going to be in context of the previous entries was a judgment call all its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, that was definitely one of the big questions at the beginning, right?" Theysen said. "What is a Dawn of War game, right? Because Dawn of War 1 and 2, at least everybody here at the company really loves, but they're very different games. And you can say, okay, maybe we can make a kind of best off of both of those. But we're not sure that that actually works. And so in the end we said, okay, we have to go with one of them. And we said ultimately, okay, let's go a little bit back to the roots, right? Let's do Dawn of War 1, or our version or our interpretation of Dawn of War 1. Let's see if something from Dawn of War 2 or even 3 works with that. And if it does, sure, then let's put it in. But Dawn of War 1 was clearly our guiding star."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's really interesting because that also informed a lot of the gameplay and design decisions that we made as well," Verbiest elaborated. "The real time strategy genre is also something that has very different market segments or different audiences that have very different, sometimes conflicting needs. And I think that having that clarity of vision of, we want to go for Dawn of War 1 and how people felt about that definitely also informed a lot of the choices that we made as to what kind of parts of the game are we focusing on. So that's why we have this emphasis on the campaigns as kind of like our flagship feature, as well as having all these fantastic cinematics and CGIs that we then have then to inform that story. Because that's something that I think a lot of people were missing from the genre for quite a while."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And storytelling is poised to be front-and-center for Dawn of War 4. While many RTSes have led with a competitive multiplayer mindset, King Art is putting a lot of emphasis on their dynamic campaigns and the single-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Because that is like the first big decision we made was basically, okay, if we do a Dawn of War 4, we want four factions back and not only three," Theysen continued. "And if we have four factions, we really would like to tell a story for each of the factions, right? And then all of the four campaigns have this overarching story, basically. And for us, that just felt like a natural thing we wanted to do because we like campaigns, we know that a lot of RTS players like campaigns, and so let's really focus on that. And then we made our lives even harder because we decided, okay, let's maybe also have the campaigns be a little bit non-linear. So there are things like, you can pick which of the Ork bosses you want to play, for example. Or there are missions that are mutually exclusive or things that you can optionally do and so on. And so for us, it's like this: the campaign is like the heart of the whole thing and that has to work. But of course, then also we have multiplayer and we have Last Stand and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're interested to hear more about the nonlinear aspects of the Ork campaign, keep an eye out for our hands-on preview later this month.

            <guid>1404967</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The God of War TV Series is still a ways off, but one of the key players of both the God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarök video games says he’d be open to continuing his work on that and other God of War projects. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking exclusively with IGN during an interview about his work on the Disney+ series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, composer Bear McCreary said he isn’t completely done with the God of War franchise. I asked McCreary if he'd be interested in expanding his work into other media or if his time on God of War was done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I still feel that I am very proud of the work that I've done (with God of War),” McCreary replied. “And if there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McCreary previously said that he felt his work on God of War was “complete,” but now seems open to revisiting the popular video game series in television form. The show is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-new-video-game-movies-2026-tv-shows-release-dates"><u>being developed</u></a> by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions to stream on Prime Video. The series, which is being helmed by Battlestar Galactica showrunner <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025"><u>Ronald D. Moore</u></a>, will follow Kratos and Atreus as they travel to the highest peak in the nine realms of Norse mythology to spread the ashes of their late wife and mother.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For his part, McCreary said that his experience working on God of War was unique to the many other franchises he’s scored, which include Lord of the Rings, Halo, Star Wars, Marvel, Terminator, and the aforementioned Percy Jackson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The great thing about working on these God of War games (is) they are so expansive,” McCreary explained. “I don't think I have written anything musically in the two games and DLC that hasn't been discovered. If anything, I think the more you dig into it, what I hope is evident is how much the team and I (were) always working to just make it better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the end of every one of these massive games, after I've played through it and all I want to do is sleep, I'm like, ‘Here's what we should do next time.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McCreary added that working on video games is inherently different from producing music for TV or movies given the interactive nature of the storytelling. “We (were) always pushing the boundaries on God of War,” he said. “For example, in God War Ragnarök we decided to implement a ‘do no harm to melody’ rule. What that means is if (a player is) really doing well in a skirmish or an encounter, you start getting these character themes and it changes depending on who your partner is in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Biggest TV Shows Coming to Every Streaming Service in 2026</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“But let's say it's Kratos's theme. If you win, normally there'd just be a big splash and it would stop. But in Ragnarök, there's the big splash, everything else stops, but that melody completes itself. It sounds simple, but it took thousands of man hours from a half dozen people to be able to do that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond God of War, McCreary’s love of gaming runs deep. So much so that he’s itching to write music for a rhythm game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would love to do something like that,” McCreary said. “I'm always looking for interesting projects, interesting people to collaborate with. One of my favorite games from the last generation is Stray. I think I've played it through seven or eight times. And I'm very interested in (indie) and AA gaming. I think there's a lot of experimentation that happens there. And I love the medium.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A Season 1 extension update arrives January 20.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have announced the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 2 release date has been delayed as it works to address community feedback with an extended Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind last year’s new Battlefield game announced a delay for the long-awaited new season with an enigmatic Season 2 trailer and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. The trailer itself is only seven seconds long, showing a gas mask emerge from green smoke before promising a Battlefield 6 and REDSEC Season 2 release date of February 17.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"This revised launch has been implemented to allow extra time to further develop and refine Season 2 as a result of community feedback," a message from the developers says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a nearly one-month late start for the next wave of content for the troubled shooter, which had previously been scheduled to deliver new maps, modes, updates, and more January 20. With Battlefield 6 Season 2 now set to launch mid-February, players have been told to expect a Season 1 extension update to arrive January 20 in its place. EA and BF Studios say the decision was made to “further polish and refine Season 2” in order to “keep our promise” of providing worthwhile content updates for all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are also reinforcing Battlefield Labs as the public preview for future game updates in the late stages of development,” the message says. “Both the Season 1 extension and the use of Battlefield Labs will set the foundation for new and exciting content throughout our live seasons, including what will come in Season 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More details on Battlefield 6 Season 2 will arrive in February, with a “greater 2026 roadmap” for both it and REDSEC set to follow “in the near future.” In the meantime, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 extension is still said to give players some of the balance tweaks and new content they’ve been begging for in recent weeks. BF Studios tells players to expect detailed patch notes prior to the extension's release date next week, teasing the update will include a showcase of Portal community experiences, severeal double XP periods, and free daily login rewards to help with the wait.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most substantial addition coming with the Battlefield 6 Season 1 extension is the Frostfitre Bonus Path, which is launching January 27. Free rewards include a Hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and other customization items, with battle pass owners also able to earn a new weapon package, a career XP boost, and more. Progress on the Frostfire Bonus Path is made conurrently with with the Season 1 battle pass and is said to require 110 Bonus Path points to fully complete. Frostfire Bonus Path points will also be earned via weekly challenges, not Bonus Challenges like what was seen in previous Bonus Paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Valentine's Day event is also set to arrive in Battlefield 6 during the extended Season 1. Details about what it includes outside of the promise of double XP weekends and daily login rewards are under wraps for now, with EA only telling players to keep an eye on its social media pages for any and all updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Moving forward together, we look forward to continuing our conversations with you, the Battlefield community, both in-game and across our official channels," the message signs off. "Again, thank you for being a part of our community and joining us for the future of this franchise, starting with our next update on January 20, 2026."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">checked in on Battlefield 6 earlier this month</a> and found that a lack of content updates, communication from BF Studios, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-lay-out-game-plan-after-winter-offensive-update-introduces-widespread-issues-across-pc-and-consoles">a disappointing end with Season 1: Winter Offensive</a> seemed to have caused its recent drop off in player interest. Contributing to an increase in negative user reviews was controversy involving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels">EA's alleged use of generative AI material</a>. Now, it seems players are simply waiting with bated breath to see if Battlefield 6 will be able to regain the momentum it had following its October 10 launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its late 2025 troubles, Battlefield 6 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">came out swinging at launch</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Collaborative challenges aren't a brand-new concept for Games Done Quick--the twice-yearly speedrunning charity event--but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdhHhCdi3VljAB_8cVnjPg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KingJO444</a> took things just a little bit further for Awesome Games Done Quick 2026. On January 10 in Pittsburgh, he gathered a group of 70 players together to attempt an absurdly chaotic challenge: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-this-ridiculous-70-person-super-mario-64-relay/1100-6537329/">Collect 70 stars in Super Mario 64</a> with 70 different players. Somehow, he and the community were successful, completing the challenge in under two hours.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't an easy feat to come up with an estimated time for the run, at all, because of the 70 people who participated--each getting exactly one star before passing off the controller--only between 15-20 had any serious experience running the game. Of the remaining players, some had not played Super Mario 64 since childhood, and others had never played the game at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"You never know how much someone's going to practice, or what's going to happen on stage," KingJ told us in a post-run interview. He set the estimated time to complete the run at an hour and 40 minutes, but this was only slightly longer than the current world record. </p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that gave enough of a buffer, but also, I kind of underestimated how many people were going to go in for their first time ever playing the game," KingJ added. "And not only that, but we also had blindfolded runners, which added on top of that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-VFPEh59k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-VFPEh59k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That meant a whole lot of training throughout the week leading up to the run. Several of the more experienced runners worked with the newcomers, ensuring they could get the star they were assigned. One was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ad129/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad129</a>, who was also very familiar with the game and supported KingJ since early in the planning phase.</p><p dir="ltr">"We spent most of the time in the practice room just having a [game] setup, if not multiple setups, and people would come on by and just do their star--either practicing or just verifying that they could do it. It was very awesome to see someone coming in with no experience in the game and we teach them the star," they added.</p><p dir="ltr">And for the most part, things went off without much of a hitch during the run. Some stars were easier than others (a few literally just talked to Toad to get a few freebies) but the pace at which the speedrunners swapped in and out of their positions and kept things moving was extremely impressive. At one point, too many failures on a certain challenge would have meant game over, but KingJ brought several Nintendo 64 consoles as redundancy options in case of an emergency, swapping to another nearly identical save file on another system in order to keep the run moving.</p><p dir="ltr">It'll be at least 18 months before GDQ is ready for a run of this magnitude again, KingJ said, but his next collaborative speedrunning attempt will likely be a bit smaller.</p><p dir="ltr">"Maybe not 70 people," he said with a laugh. "But something like Mario Kart would be a very fun one. Or something along those lines. I want to keep it mainstream, that a lot of people know, so typically Mario is a very basic one that we can do."</p><p>Whatever the future holds, the speedrunning community's certainly been successful in raising money for good causes. It raised more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/speedrun-charity-awesome-games-done-quick-2026-raised-over-2-4-million-for-cancer-research/1100-6537336/">$2.4 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation</a> during this year's AGDQ in Pittsburgh, and Summer Games Done Quick will raise money this July in Minneapolis for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts has never been a particularly popular company in the eyes of consumers, but Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares, who collaborated on three titles with the publisher, was willing to go up to bat for it during a recent interview.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, the Split Fiction director said that there are "a lot of great people at EA" who "respect" Hazelight's work and "leave [them] be."

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Can EA Save Its Reputation?</p>
      </div>
<p>While EA has an infamous reputation, "earning" the title<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-exec-responds-to-worst-company-in-america-contr/1100-6443178/" data-ref-id="1100-6443178"> of "Worst Company in America"</a> from the website Consumerist in 2012 and 2013, Fares still believed that "EA is getting more sh*t than they deserve."</p><p>The list of reasons for video game players to roast EA is long enough to warrant its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Electronic_Arts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">own Wikipedia page</a>. Fans of studios like BioWare and franchises like Titanfall and Battlefield have raised grievances over EA's management of them. In the past year, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">reportedly cancelled anticipated titles</a> and underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">mass layoffs</a>. EA is far from the only big gaming company that engages in such business practices, though.</p><p>"I mean, come on, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, everybody’s done something that’s not good," Fares continued. "But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy."</p><p>Fares emphasized Hazelight's "great relationship" with EA, while acknowledging that the company has made "mistakes like every other publisher." And it's been a lucrative relationship for Hazelight as well, with Split Fiction <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-sales-are-nearly-double-what-ea-expected-so-far/1100-6531353/" data-ref-id="1100-6531353">vastly exceeding EA's sales projections</a> when it launched last year.</p><p>As valid as Fares's points may be, EA's reputation will certainly be tested going forward, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">company's proposed sale</a> to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund sparking concerns that new ownership will lead to shifts in the company's culture and content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> announced that there is a limited-time free <strong>Styx: Blades of Greed demo</strong> available for download on PC via <strong>Steam</strong>. The demo is approximately <strong>17GB</strong> in size and includes <strong>the full first hour</strong> of the game from its beginning. </p>



<p>Players will <strong>infiltrate a massive golem</strong> attacking Styx to destroy it from the inside and also experience Styx's first real mission, <strong>a high-risk zeppelin theft</strong> under the ever-watchful eye of the Inquisition in the first open environment of the game, The Wall. According to the developers, it's a 'focused taste' of the tone, systems, and level of freedom that will be in the full game. There's an extra bit of good news: the demo's save data will carry over to the full game, so you won't have to replay the first hour if you don't want to.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nacon has also <strong>kicked off pre-orders on all platforms</strong> (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> with Pre-order Bonus includes the base game and the Master of Shadows Skin from the first installment and is available for purchase at a price of <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> <strong>on consoles</strong>, and <strong>€39.99</strong>, <strong>$39.99</strong>, and <strong>£34.99</strong> <strong>on PC</strong> via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The pricier <strong>Quartz Edition</strong>, on the other hand, includes the base game, two days of early access, the Greedy and Legacy skin packs for Styx and his weapons, a Starter Pack with two talent points and some crafting resources, and 5 additional taunts to lure enemies. The Master of Shadows Skin pre-order bonus is also included. If you want the Quartz Edition for Styx: Blades of Greed, it'll set you back <strong>€59.99</strong>, <strong>$59.99</strong>, and <strong>£54.99</strong> on consoles and <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> on PC via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Finally, there's a new <strong>Styx: Master of Stealth Collection bundle</strong> that brings together the whole stealth series: 2014's <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong>, 2017's <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong>, and the new Styx: Blades of Greed in its Quartz Edition. This is available for <strong>€69.99</strong>, <strong>$69.99</strong>, and <strong>£64.99</strong> on consoles, and is also available on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65163/Styx_Master_of_Stealth_Collection__Prepurchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, albeit at a higher price of <strong>€85.50</strong>.</p>



<p>Our own Francesco De Meo played the demo in advance as part of a press event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed cautious optimism</a>:</p>



<p><em>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options.</em></p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed launches on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru's shutdown are likely part of plans Meta apparently has to cut roughly 10% of the employees in its Reality Labs business, which works primarily on VR and AR content, as reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>That would include both studios; Twisted Pixel's last game was <em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em>, released last year, while Sanzaru's most recent titles are both in the <em>Asgard's Wrath </em>series, which was created for VR headsets.</p><p>According to the New York Times' report, these cuts are part of a general shift in terms of Meta's direction, with the company now planning to focus more of its resources into the development of AI systems.</p><p>Generative AI has proven to be a controversial subject in the gaming industry, with some major companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">embracing the technology</a> while others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excoriate it</a> for its environmental impact and the (perceived) poor quality of the assets it generates.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-scalper-charizard-pikachu-eevee-ebay-price-2000659400</link>
            <guid>1404913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In a move that will surprise absolutely no one who has paid attention to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the past five years, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><span>very expensive Lego sets</span></a><span> featuring </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>Pikachu, Eevee</span></a><span>, and the Kanto starters are selling out pretty fast. When Pokémon merchandise sells out, it inevitably ends up on reseller sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=charizard+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313"><span>Ebay</span></a><span> for astronomical prices. What do you get when you scalp already expensive toy blocks? Prices that’ll cost you enough to buy multiple game consoles and video games.</span></p> <p><span>The set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur is supposed to run for $649.99, but now that pre-orders are selling out, resellers are listing the 6800+ pieces of Lego blocks for anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Lego+pokemon+badges&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>$800 to over a grand</span></a><span>. Some of the listings include the Kanto Badges set that is being offered to those who bought the starters, while there are others that have only one of the three monsters for sale, despite them not being sold separately by Lego itself.

<p>Developer 34BigThings has released a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Carmageddon: Rogue Shift.</p>



<p>Announced back in early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/carmageddon-is-back-with-carmageddon-rogue-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 2025</a>, Carmageddon: Rogue Shit releases on February 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>







<p><strong>“Carmageddon smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.”</strong></p>



<p>The game sees players go through a roguelite campaign with branching event maps, dynamic challenges and permanent progression between runs. There will be 15 upgradeable vehicles that range from tanks to hot rods with 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to equip to your vehicle.</p>







<p>With it being a roguelite game, 34BigThings say that every run through the campaign will offer a “unique journey through a randomly generated graph.” There will also be branching patches, a variety of objections, and dynamic time of day and weather to make sure each run is different.</p>



<p>You can check out the gameplay trailer for yourself, below, and leave your thoughts down in the comments and over at the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>God of War composer Bear McCreary has said he would consider returning to the series, following his previous comments about how his work on the Sony series was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1jyxlmw/god_of_war_composer_says_his_work_on_the_series/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"complete."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-composer-says-he-would-be-open-to-revisiting-the-franchise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> asked McCreary if he might be interested in returning, and he replied, "If there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzcqvPneP0k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qzcqvPneP0k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-casting-now-underway-as-high-profile-director-comes-aboard/1100-6536621/" data-ref-id="1100-6536621">new God of War TV show in the works for Prime Video</a>, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">God of War game series is expected to continue</a>, so there could indeed be an opportunity for McCreary to work more in the franchise, if he was asked back.</p><p>Whatever the case, the composer said he's proud of the music he's written for the God of War games, adding that the games are "so expansive" and enjoyed by fans.</p><p>Beyond the God of War series, McCreary said he is "always looking for interesting projects" and "interesting people" to collaborate with.

<p>"Maybe this is the limit of it"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="cc9747870d3b1"><a title="Split Fiction" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc9747870d3b1/split-fiction.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI is absolutely bloomin' everywhere these days; doubly so if you kept an eye on CES 2026 earlier this month. There's no getting away from it, and folks are particularly keen to see what game developers think of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Josef Fares, founder of Hazelight Studios and director of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, recently caught up with Chrisopher Dring at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The subject of AI naturally cropped up, and while Fares is keen to highlight the technology's advantages in game development, he doesn't see it taking over completely anytime soon, and firmly believes that having someone with a "vision or idea" for a game is vital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI. If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</p>
<p>“You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we think it's worth pointing out that developers do, in fact, have a choice in the matter. Mentioning the idea of AI "taking over" makes it sounds like an inevitability, but we're not quite sure that's entirely accurate. Here's hoping Hazelight doesn't let itself get too dragged into the weeds, anyway.</p>
<p>A recent image for Nintendo's own 'My Mario' collection was scrutinised for potentially using AI, however the company had since come out and clarified that it did not use the technology in producing the images.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196052,195736 @ 1768329796 -->
<p><em>Are we doomed to accept that AI might inevitably become a key part of game development in the future? Or are you hopeful that devs take a stand and refuse to use it extensively? This topic isn't going away, so let us know your thoughts with a comment.</em></p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/</link>
            <guid>1404868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">New York Times</a> on Monday revealed that <strong>Meta</strong> would be <strong>laying off 10% of its Reality Labs</strong> division, the branch of its business under which it works on products like the Metaverse, and also houses its internal VR teams under <strong>Oculus Studios</strong>, including <strong>Deadpool VR</strong> developer <strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asgards-wrath-ii-hands-on-impressions-vrs-breakout-untethered-rpg/">Asgard's Wrath 2</a></strong> developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquired-sanzaru-games-asgards-wrath-for-its-oculus-studios/">Sanzaru Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, as developers began sharing the news that they had been impacted by the cuts, we learned that at least two whole studios, the aforementioned Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games, <strong>would be shut down</strong>, with the entirety of their teams laid off.</p>



<p>The first signal came from <strong>Andy Gentile</strong>, a designer at Twisted Pixel, who shared on his <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">X (formerly Twitter) account</a> that not only had he been laid off, but the entire studio, along with Sanzaru Games, had been shut down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear how many people have been impacted by the cuts, but more developers have come forward to confirm the news of the two studios shutting down, including a senior level designer at Sanzaru, Ray West, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on his personal LinkedIn page</a>, "<em>Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru.</em> <em>It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know everyone there.</em>"</p>



<p>Twisted Pixel is known for titles like Deadpool VR, 'Splosion Man, and Path of the Warrior, while Sanzaru was highly regarded for its Asgard's Wrath titles, the second of which is commonly known as one of the best VR titles to release in recent years. </p>



<p>Sanzaru also has a place in the hearts of many longtime PlayStation fans, as it was also the team that ported the first three Sly Cooper games to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and even developed the fourth entry in the franchise, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. Sanzaru was also responsible for ports of the God of War Collection and Secret Agent Clank.</p>



<p>Both studios were founded in 2006, which means that Meta is shuttering them just as they were set to hit their 20th anniversaries. A milestone that not many studios get to hit anymore in today's unstable video game industry. It's altogether an unfortunate start to 2026, and a sign that the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry for the last few years aren't going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>The bonus path in question is called Frostfire, and it's launching a week later than the extension update on January 27th.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-hytale-mods/</link>
            <guid>1404856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Modding is a huge part of gaming, and instead of concentrating on the default content, Hypixel Studios encourages the community to download and install the best Hytale mods to make the game even more wild.</p>



<p>Some games actively discourage modding and do their best to avoid having the base game assets be manipulated in any way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> is the complete polar opposite. Hytale wants you to mod, it wants you to create mods; whatever funky ideas are flowing around in your brainwaves need to be used to create fun and original content.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to mess around with Hytale and implement the best mods to make the game easier, better, or even more entertaining, this guide has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-top-hytale-mods-to-install">8 Top Hytale Mods To Install</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios and CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hytale has partnered up with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CurseForge</a> to deliver official mods. The game’s long-awaited launch was accompanied by well over 80 mods to download and install. Insider Gaming has picked out our favorite ones so far, and keep checking back as the list is updated with new mods to add. </p>



<h3 id="h-advanced-item-info">Advanced Item Info</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is comfortably one of the most (if not <em>the </em>most) downloaded Hytale mods—and for obvious reasons. It tells you much more information about the items and materials you pick up. There’s a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to survival games about the resources you collect, leaving it up to you to decide what they’re for, or discover their main purpose(s). This mod eliminates a lot of the mystery and gets straight to the point.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/advanced-item-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Advanced Item Info mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-foliage">Ymmersive Foliage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios and founder Simon Collins-Laflamme have been hard on themselves at times in the build-up to launch. It’s in early access, and the team has said that it needs a lot of work. It’s probably true, but the game’s early access launch looked spectacular. However, if you want to spruce and juice up the environment with extra color, depth, and detail, the Ymmersive Foliage mode does that in Hytale.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-foliage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Foliage mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-lucky-mining">Lucky Mining</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A good way to think about this mod is like hacking away at a material in Fortnite. You get rewarded for consecutive good hits, and it’s kind of the same here. If you keep mining the same material in a row—Ores, in this case—you get more of it. It can make the grind easier, and stock up your inventory with enough Ore to start a new country.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/lucky-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Lucky Mining mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-yung-s-hydungeons">YUNG’s HyDungeons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>This mod might not be for beginners, but if you fancy a devious dungeon-based challenge and upgrade, consider checking out the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod. It adds new dungeons with “procedurally generated dungeon instances.” You do need to hit 100 Memories first, but there will come a point where you can enjoy this fabulous mod.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-thorium-furnaces">Thorium Furnaces</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, a good quality-of-life feature can go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a wild mod that breaks the game. The Thorium Furnaces mode adds 11 new furnaces, and they speed up the smelting process, saving a lot of time. The rarer the furnace, the faster it gets the job done, allowing you to go exploring quicker.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/thorium-furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Thorium Furnaces mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wan-s-wonder-weapons">Wan’s Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are after a wild mod that is just plain fun, look no further than Wan’s Wonder Weapons. When you think of ‘Wonder Weapons,’ you might think of Call of Duty’s Ray Gun, but here, you get special weapons like the Maelstrom anchor, Frostburn sword, or Chromatic Cleaver—the final one looking like it was pulled straight from a unicorn. If a pickaxe or regular sword just isn’t cutting it, download and get yourself Wan’s Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wan’s Wonder Weapons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-melodies">Ymmersive Melodies</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can “Annoy your friends with custom melodies” using the Ymmersive Melodies mod in Hytale. Does more need to be said? If you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-invite-friends-join-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing with friends in Hytale</a>, why wouldn’t you want to upload custom melodies to make them want to throw Wild Berries or Dark Feathers at you?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Melodies mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wayback-charm">Wayback Charm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we come to the home stretch, it makes sense to end with a mod that aptly takes you home. CurseForge says this about the mod: “The Wayback Charm is a magical tool that can help you find your way back home. Simply press the use key (F) while holding the charm, and you will be teleported to the nearest respawn point. Respawn points can be created using blocks like beds. If you do not have a respawn location, or the respawn location is considered invalid, you will be sent to the world spawn.” Sounds good, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wayback-charm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wayback Charm mod here.</a></p>



<p>Have your say on Hytale modding. Have you found any must-have lists that have been left off this list? If so, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let the staff know, as the mod might end up on this list!</p>

            <guid>1404853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta is scaling back its gaming presence with a round of layoffs. A report on Monday from the New York Times said that the company was set to let go roughly 10% of staff from the Reality Labs side of the company. </p>



<p>One day later, and it appears <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that those layoffs</a> have begun with a number of studios being hit. </p>







<p>Reality Labs, if you didn’t know, houses Meta’s Oculus Studios division. Oculus Studios is responsible for managing the various first party studios and teams that develop games for the Meta Quest VR headsets.</p>



<p>Two studios known to be impacted by the layoffs are Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. In a <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, designer Andy Gentile revealed that he had been let go. In his post, Gentile added that <strong>“It appears the entire Twisted Pixel games studio has been shut down. Sanzaru Games too.”</strong></p>



<p>Over on LinkedIn, Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed that Sanzaru</a>, along with “several Meta game studios” were shut down.</p>



<p><strong>“It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,”</strong> he said.</p>







<p>Prior to the layoffs and studio closures, Twisted Pixel Games recently released Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3. For Sanzaru, they developed the highly regarded Asgard’s Wrath and Asgard’s Wrath 2.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Meta for comment on how many jobs were lost and all of the studios hit as part of these layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

Pricing and an exact release date for these items have not yet been revealed, but we'll update the post as soon as Razer confirms them.</p><div title="6537354 - Evangelion Eva Unit-02 Razer Collection" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5431" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537354 - Evangelion Eva Unit-02 Razer Collection" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Razer+Goes+Full+Neon+Genesis+Evangelion+With+EVA+Unit-02+Collection&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6537354&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcollabs%2Fevangelion-02&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fevangelion-eva-unit-02-razer-collection-preorder-guide%2F1100-6537354%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Razer+Goes+Full+Neon+Genesis+Evangelion+With+EVA+Unit-02+Collection&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6537354&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcollabs%2Fevangelion-02&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fevangelion-eva-unit-02-razer-collection-preorder-guide%2F1100-6537354%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Razer+Goes+Full+Neon+Genesis+Evangelion+With+EVA+Unit-02+Collection&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+09%3A29%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6537354&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcollabs%2Fevangelion-02&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fevangelion-eva-unit-02-razer-collection-preorder-guide%2F1100-6537354%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook&amp;event_type=click">Razer Viper V3 Pro: Evangelion (EVA-02) Edition</a>       </h2>                                                                                                                         <div><p>One of Razer's popular gaming mice, the Viper V3 Pro, is an ultralight esports model.

The original series still holds up well as a cult-classic '90s anime series full of cool giant robot designs, fights, and several existential crises, and you can get the full series on Blu-ray for $42. This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films. The first Evangelion film, Death (True), is essentially a clip show that recaps the series, and The End of Evangelion is a retelling of the final two episodes.</p><p>Anyone who's familiar with the series will want to check out the four Rebuild of Evangelion movies. Released in four parts from 2007 to 2021, the project began as an almost shot-for-shot remake of the early episodes before introducing major changes to the established story, introducing new plotlines and characters. Shout Factory has released all of them to date, both as standard and limited-edition Blu-rays.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJMQ34H9,B0FJMR1VDP,B00GS1EOJS,B0CC4JV5XJ,B0D136B49L,B0CC4GFWDF,B07GQ8VXZ5,B0012V4WSM,B004EC5IV6,B00GS1DM2S,B0BS1P8LFN,1421550792,1421553058,1421553627,1421553635,1421586541,1974707032,1421507676&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJMQ34H9,B0FJMR1VDP,B00GS1EOJS,B0CC4JV5XJ,B0D136B49L,B0CC4GFWDF,B07GQ8VXZ5,B0012V4WSM,B004EC5IV6,B00GS1DM2S,B0BS1P8LFN,1421550792,1421553058,1421553627,1421553635,1421586541,1974707032,1421507676&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion &amp;

                <p>Tom Clancy's<em> The Division</em> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">The Division 2</a> players are the ones who are getting a gift. An update coming this March will add a Realism Mode to The Division 2, giving fans a new way to experience the game.</p><p>Realism Mode is only available for players who purchased the Warlords of New York expansion. The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode.</p><p>In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared. However, it sounds like outfits and gear from Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six Siege, and Ghost Recon will be added to the game.</p><p>Following the anniversary season, Ubisoft has plans to add even more content to The Division 2. But according to the video, the publisher won't share those details until March.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-definitive-edition-spotted-in-the-wild/1100-6537325/" data-ref-id="1100-6537325">a definitive edition of The Division</a> was spotted in Japan, but it's unclear when or if Ubisoft will announce that project. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">The Division 3</a> remains in development and franchise executive producer Julian Gerighty recently said, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/" data-ref-id="1100-6535549">It’s shaping up to be a monster</a>."</p>

                <p>Those discontent with their current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> housing neighborhood may soon have another option at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those participating in WoW's recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">player housing feature</a> have two options when it comes to joining a neighborhood. The first is to join a public neighborhood that is open to anyone, while the second is to be a member of a guild and join a neighborhood that only fellow guild members can live in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhshcr68CJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nhshcr68CJ0?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Soon, however, it looks like there will be a third option to choose from. The ability to create invite-only charter neighborhoods recently appeared for testing on the beta for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. The feature doesn't appear to be fully functioning just yet, but there is an option for naming and purchasing a charter neighborhood, implying that the feature is indeed on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">This charter option lets the owner invite whoever they want to the neighborhood, including players from an opposite faction, allowing Horde and Alliance players to live side-by-side. This option also allows for players from different servers or guilds, as is the case with public neighborhoods.</p><p dir="ltr">Exactly how much it might cost to create a charter neighborhood is still unknown, but if it's relatively cheap, it could have some side effects. If players are easily able to create their own private neighborhoods, more public neighborhoods could start to become abandoned. However, players can easily pick up their house and move it to a new, more populated neighborhood with little effort.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether character neighborhoods will go live with WoW's Midnight pre-patch on January 20 or with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion proper on March 2</a> (or sometime later) is still unclear. However, players have already wasted little time coming up with all kinds of awe-inspiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-creations-so-far/2900-7370/" data-ref-id="2900-7370">player housing creations</a>, so giving one person or a small group the keys to an entire neighborhood could create some even more impressive results.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what is definitely coming in the Midnight pre-patch, the update will introduce class talent tree changes, a new Demon Hunter specialization, major user interface updates, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pricey-wow-transmog-changes-have-players-angry-and-confused/1100-6536391/" data-ref-id="1100-6536391">overhaul of WoW's transmog system</a>, and a controversial new policy towards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">player-made add-ons</a> that will see many related to combat no longer function.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed is probably one of my most anticipated games this year, so I am pleased to let you know that there is now a demo available to try out.</p>
<p>This demo will give you the chance to play the first hour of Styx: Blades of Greed, which (I am 99 percent sure) will plop you down at The Wall. This is one of the areas I got to explore during a preview session with developer Cyanide last year.</p>

<p>While this Styx: Blades of Greed demo is only available to try out on Steam, the game itself will be launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. As for when, that would be 19th February, so in a little over a month's time.</p>
<p>Cyanide has said that demo save data will be transferable to the full version on Blades of Greed's release. If this all sounds good to you, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">check out the demo via Steam</a> now. </p>
<p>As well as this nugget of demo news, the studio has also released a new trailer for Styx: Blades of Greed, which hands narrative duties over to Styx himself. Here, the caustic goblin explains his love of Quartz (a powerful and precious substance), as well as showing off some of his new gear such as the glider.</p>
<p>You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Like I said already, I got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed last year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular goblin and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

<p>Down 33% in 5 months</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7ecc99f80aabf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ecc99f80aabf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price has been on a downward turn over the last several months, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sq">currently sitting at 9,950 yen</a> following an all-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are inevitable in this business, but according to <a href="https://kantangames.com/">Kantan Games</a>' CEO Dr. Serkan Toto, Nintendo's investors are "spooked" by the prospect of price rises along with the lack of any major first-party titles in 2026 (so far!).</p>
<p>In a post on X (via <a href="https://xcancel.com/serkantoto/status/2011080382108913781#m">XCancel</a>), Toto states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo stock in Japan is sliding: All-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025, and closed at 9,950 yen today.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"So -33% in 5 months: Investors are spooked by possible price hikes, lack of 1st-party hits and US/EU hardware discounts during the holidays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, we're not sure what the heck is going on with that last point. Was anyone really expecting to see a console discount within the first year of sale? Christmas or not, that just seems bonkers to us.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a noteworthy downturn, but we're not worried at the moment. The Switch 2, despite some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-sales-reportedly-struggled-over-the-christmas-period">apparent struggles over the Christmas period</a>, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">still the fastest-selling console of all time</a>. Furthermore, we're confident Nintendo will have some more big games up its sleeve for the latter half of 2026. <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong>, anyone?</p>
