<p>The PlayStation 30th Anniversary celebration is continuing with a fun little feature that will certainly scratch the nostalgia itch. For a limited time, PlayStation 5 users can change various parts of the system’s startup.</p>



<p>Options include the console’s bootup options, sound effects, background colors, and general theme. There is a theme for the first four PlayStation consoles to choose from.</p>



<p>You can check out the examples below of the looks below:</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-classic-themes-for-ps5">How To Get The Classic Themes For PS5</h2>



<p>If you want to check them out for yourself, simple follow these steps:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-history-of-indiana-jones-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you go by last year’s finalists for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards, there are indie games, and there are “indie” games. That is, there are independent games financed and made by individuals or teams free from the influence of a major publisher, and there are “independent” games that are… actually owned by billion-dollar South Korean corporations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you’re not interested in the debate about what can be named an indie game and what can’t, there is a <em>third</em> type of Indy game, and <em>they</em> are named after a dog.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-fond-memories-1732678475338.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I got a lot of fond memories of that dog."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After well over 10 years since his last dedicated digital adventure, Indiana Jones is returning to video games in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is arriving imminently on PC, Xbox, and Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did we get here? Well, Indiana Jones games may have otherwise dried up over the past decade-and-change, but <em>before</em> that, the good Doctor Jones’ video game history dates back over 40 years. So kick back as we dust off some antique hardware and whip through the history of Indiana Jones games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First created by George Lucas back in the early ’70s, Indiana Jones – originally conceived as Indiana <em>Smith</em> – was heavily inspired by the adventure serials of Lucas’ youth, and the character’s trademark look took a heavy dose of inspiration from the likes of Alan Ladd in the 1943 film China, Humphrey Bogart in 1948’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Charlton Heston in Secret of the Incas from 1954.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a surname shift, Indiana Jones was brought to life by Harrison Ford on the big screen in one of the most magnificent action adventure movies ever made: 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. As you almost certainly already know, Raiders of the Lost Ark was followed by two absolutely outstanding films and two… other films.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-nasty-1732678614048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Now you're getting nasty."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What you may <em>not</em> know, however, is where Indiana Jones made his very first appearance on the small screen. The answer is Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600. It was created by legendary Atari game designer Howard Scott Warshaw, the man behind Yars’ Revenge – the best-selling first-party game ever on the console. Raiders of the Lost Ark hit the Atari 2600 in late 1982, around a year-and-a-half after the film had arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only first played my dad’s 2600 <em>later </em>in the ’80s, and about all I remember is instantly bouncing off anything more obtuse than Outlaw, which is a game with a premise that begins and ends at “shoot the cowboy on the other side of the TV.” Despite my unequivocal love of all things Indy, Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari was not my type of thing. Looking at it through a modern lens, however, it is certainly a fascinatingly complex and ambitious Atari 2600 game – even if it is confusing and more than a little unfair. Come on, snakes the same colour as the ground?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-2600-1732678774966.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1982's Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the Atari 2600.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a strictly single-player experience, it required the use of both the console’s joystick controllers to operate. The right joystick moves Indy around the limited assortment of screens, and the left stick allows players to navigate their inventory and select the object you want Indy to use. Of course, utilising both controllers came with the benefit of DOUBLING the amount of buttons players had at their disposal. Twice the buttons!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-just-the-two-1732678893770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"It was just the two."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, yes, Indy is correct: Atari 2600 controllers only have one button, so yep, it was just the two. However, don’t assume Raiders of the Lost Ark is simple on account of having such a limited spectrum of controls. Rather, it’s anything but. With the benefit of hindsight and the fact that the effective route through this game has long since been charted, Raiders of the Lost Ark’s arcane gameplay seems almost quaint in 2024 – but how exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Raiders of the Lost Ark holds the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/88979-first-videogame-based-on-an-official-movie-licence" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guinness World Record as the first-ever video game based on an official movie licence</u></a>. It would seem it just pipped Alien from Fox Video Games, which also came out in November 1982, although that was literally just a Pac-Man clone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, that, and that <em>other</em> alien movie tie-in for the Atari 2600 from December 1982: E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Coincidentally, E.T. was actually <em>also</em> designed by Howard Scott Warshaw (at the request of Steven Spielberg himself, no less), though he only had five weeks to make it. Of course, that’s a story for a <em>different</em> documentary.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-see-this-priceless-1732678989803.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I take it, I bury it in the sand for a thousand years; it becomes priceless."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next video game would be his first original one: Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, which was released by Mindscape for the Commodore 64 in late 1984. It features a… pretty nifty arrangement of John Williams’ unforgettable theme music, but very little else worth celebrating, depending on how much mileage you reckon you’d get out of a constipated cowboy turning birds into butterflies with an apparently enchanted walking stick. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-lost-kingdom-1732679499488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1984's Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, for Commodore 64.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s box boasted that "Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you." It wasn’t quite true – <a href="https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-15/page/n33/mode/1up?view=theater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there was actually a clue hotline for stumped players</u></a> to call and be told how to proceed – but either way it feels like Mindscape was putting a lot of stock in the cognitive powers of the youth of the ’80s here. I was there, and I can’t exactly vouch for it, but maybe that was just the palookas I hung around with back then.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-not-one-brain-1732679266588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"They have not one brain among them."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next official movie tie-in came with August 1985’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game, which arrived a little over a year after the movie. Also developed by Atari, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was instantly a huge step up over its Atari 2600 predecessor – and not simply because Indiana Jones no longer looked like a tiny UFO floating over a fire hydrant. The Temple of Doom arcade game was a very early example of digitised speech in video games – something that had only just started in Atari’s 1983 Star Wars arcade game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/temple-of-doom-arcade-1732679647638.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1985's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, for arcades.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With his iconic whip, players were required to hustle their way through Mola Ram’s lair, freeing captured children, avoiding spike traps, and defeating cultists and creatures. A mine cart level obviously made an appearance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Versions of Temple of Doom eventually made their way to home devices like the Commodore 64 and the NES but, as was generally the case during the golden age of arcades, the home versions looked and played like vastly inferior knock offs of the real thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1987, Mindscape returned with yet <em>another </em>original Indiana Jones game that flaunted the series’ naming conventions by switching the “and the” for a much clumsier “in”: Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients. It was a text adventure, so Mindscape wasn't just going back in time for Indy’s story matter – it was going back in time for its game design, too.

One of those was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, first published on PCs in 1989 by Lucasfilm Games, which was later renamed LucasArts, and then later still, Lucasfilm Games again. Versions of the game eventually made their way to approximately every other platform on Earth in the early ’90s. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-action-1732680355798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, no version of the game was very good and, considering Indiana Jones is supposed to be a teenager in the scene depicted in the above screenshot, the understanding of the movie some versions displayed was rudimentary at best.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-insulting-1732680574031.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"You're insulting them, and you're embarrassing me."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, be that as it may, it’s hard to get too misty eyed about The Action Game when it was so thoroughly outclassed by its own stablemate, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure. While Lucasfilm Games had outsourced the development of The Action Game to a long-defunct studio called Tiertex, The Graphic Adventure was developed by Lucasfilm Games itself, and was the third game to run on the studio’s now famous SCUMM engine – after Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. Point-and-click adventure games have always been Lucasfilm Games’ bread and butter, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure remains a fine example of its work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-graphic-1732682035503.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, from 1989.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Led by adventure game legend Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame, The Graphic Adventure sticks far more closely to the events of the film, though it still finds room to colour outside the lines of the script with sequences that allow Indy to talk his way around Nazi encounters if you’re canny enough. Or, you can just punch Hitler right in his goddamn face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are definitely some quality of life issues present in The Last Crusade that later Lucasfilm point-and-click games would go on to iron out, but there’s no denying the tremendous attention to detail the team managed to squeeze into it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-taito-1732682148005.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1991's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, published by Taito.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The third game based on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a NES-exclusive action game from Taito, which was distinct from “<em>The</em> Action Game”, but <em>did </em>mean there were literally two Last Crusade tie-ins available on NES published out of opposite sides of the planet. For reference, you can recognise the Taito one via Indy’s high-kicking martial arts skills, as it appears Harrison Ford has been replaced with Jean Claude Van Damme. But hey, I guess I love Kickboxer and Bloodsport as much as the next guy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-complaining-1732682199921.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Then what are you complaining about?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, nothing, I guess, although the topic of recasting Harrison Ford does bring us neatly to 1993’s The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles by Chris Gray Enterprises, Incorporated, and 1994’s Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones from the less enterprising but equally incorporated Brian A. Rice, Incorporated. The former was a NES exclusive, and the latter was only available on Sega Genesis, which went by the slightly cooler ‘Sega Mega Drive’ in Japan and Europe, the accidentally mispronounced ‘See-ga Mega Drive’ in Australasia, and the… very different ‘Super Aladdin Boy’ in South Korea. No, that’s not made up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/young-indy-sega-1732683532535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1994's Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, in keeping with the TV show that aired between ’92 and ’93, Harrison Ford was, in fact, replaced with Sean Patrick Flanery – at least for the box art. The platforming action in each, however, was not particularly fun or memorable enough for either of them to be much more than a footnote in Indiana Jones’ gaming history. Certainly not fun or memorable enough to ignore the magnificent game we just skipped: 1992’s legendary Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis finds Indy in a race against time to beat the Nazis to the lost underwater city of Atlantis. Directed by Hal Barwood, the game had initially been intended to be based on a sidelined Indiana Jones script written by Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire director Chris Columbus prior to The Last Crusade. However, Barwood – who himself had earlier co-written Steven Spielberg’s first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express – petitioned to create an original story for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-1732683670616.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Barwood collaborated with The Last Crusade co-designer Noah Falstein, who introduced the concept of having three different routes through the game’s story: The Wits Path, which focuses on a more cerebral challenge, the Fists Path, which is a more action-oriented, Hollywood experience with lighter puzzles, and the Team Path, where Indy remains with his partner Sophia Hapgood to solve puzzles together. These paths would branch away after the first act, though they would converge again towards the end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Representing LucasArts at around the peak of its point-and-click power, The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time. That said, it’s hard to say whether it would have been the same smash hit with the name the suits reportedly <em>wanted</em> to give it, which was simply “Indy’s Next Adventure.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-fools-1732683739962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Bureaucratic fools!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with The Last Crusade, LucasArts simultaneously published an entirely redundant second version of the Fate of Atlantis: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, which was developed by Attention to Detail, slightly before it briefly hit the big time with the futuristic Rollcage racing series. With its isometric view and its finicky and frankly awful controls, Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game was actually a far poorer action game than the platformers that had preceded it. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-action-1732683852882.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A CD version of the Graphic Adventure arrived in 1993 with full voice acting, but unfortunately a planned follow-up called Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix was cancelled – although the game’s story was still actually published in a limited Dark Horse comic series from December 1994 to March 1995.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, while Indiana Jones’ graphic adventures were wrapping up on PC, SNES owners were in for one final taste of Indiana Jones’ greatest adventures in Indiana Jones’… Greatest Adventures. Released in late 1994 in North America and mid-1995 in Japan and PAL territories, Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a Super Star Wars-style side scroller that encompasses the events of all three original films. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-greatest-adventures-1732683966889.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Factor 5's Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994–95.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Factor 5 – which would go on to develop a string of Star Wars games with LucasArts, including the Rogue Squadron series – Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures features a horde of familiar locations from the movies, some seriously impressive Mode 7 sequences to break up the platforming action, and well balanced combat split between Indy’s whip, pistol, and grenades. Sure, it was harder than a woodpecker’s lips, and sure it took a few detours to accommodate some genre-typical boss battles – particularly since Indiana Jones villains in the films have a habit of literally killing themselves – but Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a much-loved segment of the Indiana Jones gaming tapestry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-tapestries-1732684050945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Tapestries?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Less beloved was the peculiar 1996 PC game Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures, which was led by Fate of Atlantis creator Hal Barwood but was an entirely different sort of adventure game. With its budget price and retro RPG aesthetic – even for the mid-’90s – Desktop Adventures was officially designed for a more casual audience to idly play in windowed mode while they were doing other tasks, and its procedurally generated approach promised “literally billions of possible games,” as per an enthusiastic claim on the game’s box art. One mission even had Indy retrieving the head of C-3P0. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-c3po-1732684228833.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This Easter egg was later re-referenced in 2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this casual take on Indy-themed adventuring was not exactly welcomed by critics. Thanks in no small part to LucasArts’ existing reputation as the home of genre-leading adventure games, Desktop Adventures’ low-fi and frictionless approach was met with an inauspicious reaction. It also probably didn’t help that 1996 also saw the debut of Tomb Raider, a 3D adventure more cutting edge than Lara Croft’s tank top. Though she was certainly inspired by Indiana Jones, Lara rapidly rose to become a certified cultural icon herself. Indiana Jones had some archaeological competition, and she was more than happy to muscle Indiana out of the equation. Indeed, 1999’s Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation even had an Easter egg of Indiana Jones’ skeleton – complete with a fedora and a whip.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-trying-to-kill-us-1732684312693.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Those people are trying to kill us!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones finally entered the third dimension himself in 1999’s Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for PC – which, coincidentally enough – is about an ancient Babylonian device that facilitates interdimensional travel. Again directed by Hal Barwood, The Infernal Machine is a third-person action adventure heavily informed by Core’s early Tomb Raider games. Run. Jump. Pull blocks. <em>Push</em> blocks. Lara may have begun life as an Indy imitator, but now Indy was looking at Lara, and copying her every move. Puzzles weren’t particularly taxing, though performing them sometimes was with the somewhat cumbersome controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 1947, The Infernal Machine benched the series’ normal Nazi baddies in favour of Soviets instead, who are intent on harnessing the power of the titular Infernal Machine and its interdimensional properties for an edge in the quickly escalating Cold War. It did, however, bring back Sophia Hapgood from The Fate of Atlantis, which was a neat touch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-infernal-machine-1732684376376.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1999's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, for PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Infernal Machine was initially set to receive a PlayStation port, but it was cancelled. An N64 version did make it into the wild in 2000, albeit exclusively in the US, and it was only available to purchase via the LucasArts company store, or purchase or rent from Blockbuster. You know, the stores that used to let you borrow games for a small fee, before that beautiful concept was sacrificed in order to let people stream Is It Cake? directly to their phones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The N64 version was <em>supposed</em> to make its way to PAL territories but after numerous delays that was eventually cancelled. There was also a top down handheld version of Infernal Machine released in 2001, although it unfortunately arrived on the Game Boy Color just as the Game Boy Advance was arriving to replace the Game Boy Color.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-museum-1732684464910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"That belongs in a museum!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next adventure came in 2003, courtesy of The Collective, a team fresh off 2002’s Xbox exclusive Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Taking place in 1935, Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb was actually a prequel to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving first on the original Xbox, then PC, then several months later on PS2, the Emperor’s Tomb remained relatively Tomb Raider adjacent, but it dialled back the brainteasers and block puzzles in favour of lever hunting and light platforming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb was also considerably more combat oriented, with a brawling system borrowed directly from Buffy and the ability to use items lying around the world as weapons, including chairs and broken table legs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want – in this case, the Heart of the Dragon, a perfect black pearl legend says can control the hearts of men. However, it also packed a few surprises, including an appearance by an enormous dragon and a showdown with a huge kraken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here I was thinking the only crackin’ involving Indy was the sound his whip made. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-emperors-tomb-1732684601305.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2003's Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, for Xbox, PC, and eventually PS2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts began work on a follow-up to The Emperor’s Tomb in 2004, destined for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, both of which were set to arrive in late 2005 and late 2006 respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were treated to a first glimpse of the game in a quirky tech-focused teaser trailer which LucasArts used to illustrate some of the advancements it was promising under the hood. It was actually our first look at the animation middleware Euphoria, the biomechanical AI that would go on to hit the big time in 2008’s Grand Theft Auto IV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, work on the much-anticipated project faltered, and the game missed its planned 2007 release. To make matters worse for LucasArts, Naughty Dog had also decided to join them in the archaeological arena with November 2007’s Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune for PlayStation 3, the first outing for the now iconic PlayStation hero Nathan Drake.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-competitor-good-1732684713467.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"A competitor.

With a great sense of imagination and a huge list of playable characters, LEGO Indiana Jones was certainly the most fun way to re-experience the original films in a virtual environment since Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures for SNES back in 1994. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/lego-indy-1732684775164.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, from Traveller's Tales.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveller’s Tales released a quickfire sequel in 2009 dubbed LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, which included new levels for the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but slightly poorer versions of the original trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But back over at LucasArts, how were things going with its belated but bold new biomechanically-driven baby?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-our-situation-1732684924333.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Our situation has not improved."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in early 2009 it was confirmed that LucasArts had permanently iced its Xbox 360 and PS3 Indiana Jones project, and the reportedly largely-unfinished game would never see the light of day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts allowed its third-party partners to continue working on the PS2, PSP, DS, and Wii version of the project, published in mid-2009 as Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, but the reception for an Indy adventure on such superseded hardware was understandably tepid. What did the Staff of Kings get from IGN?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-five-1732685038008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Five. You know it and I know it."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released right in the heart of the motion control fad, the Staff of Kings was hamstrung by its drastic overuse of waggle. Even the Wii-exclusive co-op mode that paired Indy up with his dad was diabolically unfun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, the general consensus was that the best thing about the Staff of Kings on Wii was that it came with Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis embedded in it as a bonus. Well, that and the absolutely dead-on Sean Connery impersonation from Scottish actor Lewis MacLeod.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-staff-of-kings-1732685128872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2009's Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, for Wii.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But was this just an isolated misstep in the Indiana Jones gaming saga?

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an extremely demanding game that has trouble <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-pushes-ryzen-7-9800-x3d-limits/">running well</a> even on top-end hardware, but a new mod now available online introduces some optimization improvements that bring significant performance improvements at 4K and 1440p resolutions.</p>
<p>The Optimization Essentials mod developed by Hybred, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/60?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a variety of tweaks that clean up Unreal Engine's effects quality, reduce ghosting and stuttering and improve loading and boot times. While some of the presets have a big impact on visual quality, the mod introduces considerable performance improvements of up to 25% at 4K and 1440p resolution, as showcased in a new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC, </a>so it's definitely worth using for those who cannot run the game well, no matter the graphics settings used.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Optimization Mod - Up to 25% More FPS | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.8 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUZhbYvN-L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a more than worthy entry in the series, offering exactly what fans expected the game to be. While the experience is sometimes unbalanced, exploring the Zone is incredibly engaging, although its sheer size sometimes works against the experience as a whole, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Let's make one thing clear: STALKER 2 is one of the largest single player shooter games I've played, if not the largest. I reached the end after playing for 47 and a half hours, and that's after abandoning some of the sidequests. While I generally love large games, the sheer size doesn't always work in this game's favor. That's because most of the time you're scattered through the vast, completely seamless 64 square kilometers map, running on one wild goose chase after another. It gets a little repetitive after some time (prepare to visit a dozen different secret laboratories), not to mention slightly tedious for all the reasons explained in the earlier portion of the review. Moreover, while some side missions are interesting, most are fairly run-of-the-mill.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

<p>On December 3, it’ll be 30 years since the original PlayStation first launched in Japan. A system that changed the course of the industry, PlayStation has been at the top of the console market for three decades now. To start the celebration, not only is Sony holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-sale-500-games-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty massive sale</a> on the PlayStation Store, but the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released</a> a new “Thank You” video for its fans.</p>



<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together,” Sony says in the video description. “Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>



<p>The two-minute video shows some of the biggest franchises in the console’s history with various messages about what PlayStation “is about”. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While December 3 marks the official 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the console didn’t release in North America and Europe until September 1995. That means there’s still another nine months of celebration to happen, and plenty of more time for PlayStation to say “Thank You”.</p>

            <p>
Sony has released a nostalgia-fuelled video to mark PlayStation's 30th anniversary. 
</p>
<p>
It's just gone 3pm here in the UK, which means it's now past midnight on 3rd December in Japan - 30 years to the day since Sony's PS1 first launched in the country. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's video features a montage of classic games past and present that have all had a huge impact on PlayStation's legacy, beginning with Horizon: Forbidden West, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and The Last of Us Part 2, set to a gentle remix of The Cranberries' Dreams. (Dreams itself does not feature.)

<p>
God of War, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune">Uncharted</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man and many more make the cut, and like PlayStation itelf, there's plenty of third-party blockbusters here alongside games from Sony's own studios. 
</p>
<p>
"For the past three decades, we've shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together," Sony wrote alongside the video. 
</p>
<p>
"Along the way, we've found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We've forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey - we couldn't have done it without you."
</p>
<p>Last week we learned a newly-official <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">sales total for PS2 of 160m sales</a>. Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">PlayStation also rolled out a special tube carriage on the London Underground</a>.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has a special week of PlayStation-themed content lined up, beginning when 3rd December rolls around here in the UK.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/blizzard-is-removing-original-warcraft-i-and-ii-from-gog-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The classic versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II are being delisted from GOG on 13th December, at Blizzard’s request. However, anyone that buys the games before that date will continue to receive ongoing support from GOG themselves as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably someone at Blizzard just couldn’t handle the idea that the games are available in their original form when there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/warcraft-and-warcraft-2-remastered-released-alongside-major-update-for-warcraft-3-reforged/">recently been a remaster of the games</a> – a bit like how you can’t buy a legit print of the original Star Wars films, for some reason. These remasters have brought a number of technical improvements, such as multi-unit selection in Warcraft I and right click actions across the board, as well as revised graphics that can be toggled on and off at will.</p>
<p>However, there’s something just a little bit off about the remastered graphics, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJ3ebyzORk">they forgot to accommodate for the tall pixels</a> with the original game that came from playing DOS games on old CRT screens. It means that everything in the remastered game is just a bit… wider. Also the mission briefings have motion that are completely ignored for Blizzard’s remastered versions.</p>


<p>Warcraft on GOG, however, has already had a number of preservation efforts made as it’s integrated into the DOSBox emulator for the original, and with a custom DirectX wrapper for the sequel. As some of the first inductees into the Preservation Program, GOG committed to ensuring that these games would have technical support from them to maintain compatibility with the newest versions of Windows.</p>
<p>GOG is now extending that with a pledge to maintain compatibility even if a game is delisted from their store. It’s worth remembering that games bought via GOG are DRM free, so they can always be downloaded, stored and played later.</p>

<p>As part of this announcement, they’ve cooked up a $2 USD, €2, £1.50 and 8 PLN discount using the code MAKEWARCRAFTLIVEFOREVER on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle">Warcraft I &amp; II Bundle</a>, bringing it down a smidge to £10.39.</p>
<p>The Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest with the full trilogy of Warcraft RTS games is £34.99.</p>
<p>GOG closed out the announcement by saying:</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Blizzard on these titles. While the delisting is unfortunate, we assure you that every user who already owns these games on GOG will continue to benefit from our commitment and have access to versions that remain compatible with modern systems, preserving their experience for years to come.</p>
<p>“We’re thankful to every Blizzard employee who contributed to these timeless games and for your ongoing partnership over the years. Game preservation is at the heart of what we do, and we hope to continue collaborating with Blizzard to keep these iconic titles accessible to future generations of gamers.”</p>

            <p>Netease's free to play open world gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Project Mugen now has a proper name: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>. As Edwin points out in the Maw, it is very much like Spider-Man meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, with its mixture of cityslinging and unabashed anime teens with long, flowy hair and a penchant for metal accessories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Project Mugen debuted in August 2023, with devs Naked Rain releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAPIKxrSDw">slick trailer</a> that showed its anime cast (technically not) webslinging across a lavishly presented city, as well as driving cars and cyberbikes around its neon streets. It garnered a lot of attention. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-mugens-lead-producer-reveals-the-games-and-films-inspiring-this-open-world-action-rpg">IGN</a> has an interview from later that year that goes over combat and microtransactions. Then, there's a bit of a silence.</p>
<p>Naked Rain emerged with a bit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Mugen/comments/1amcsmw/happy_spring_festival_spring_festivals_messages/">Chinese New Year art</a> in February 2024. In August, they held a recruitment event in Shanghai, where fans could talk with the devs and possibly join the team (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1gbrexs/where_is_project_mugen_a_short_overview_of_things/">here's a link to a reddit post</a> that rounds everything up nicely). Now, they've released a trailer announcing the game's name change and an overview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9py8e7ma7U">with snippets of in-game footage</a>.</p>

<p>So does it look any good? Well, the world is easy on the eye and traversing it seems fun. I'm into the way you can enter shops without any loading screens, and the sneak peaks of combat seem slick. It's still too early to say how it'll all come together, especially when this is a gacha game and will no doubt feature about a bazillion currencies and steer players towards opening their wallets to secure the bunny girls with the highest stats.</p>
<p>There's another trailer dropping on the 4th December, so hopefully that will reveal a bit more on what you'll <em>actually</em> get up to. You can pre-register for Ananta over on <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">their website</a>, although there's no release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming for the crown of ARPG king. It’s no secret the original PoE has co-op and multiplayer, so I’m here to clear up any questions and confusions relating to Path of Exile 2’s potential co-op and multiplayer—it would be nice to have someone to clear the path with.</p>



<p>Multiplayer takes many forms in 2024: Online multiplayer shooters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, couch co-op tag teams in It Takes Two, and outrageous tests of patience such as Chained Together. I personally love single-player games as much as anyone, but you can’t beat getting together for some harmonious co-op or multiplayer action.</p>



<p>The nature of Path of Exile 2 makes it perfect for either form of gameplay. 2013’s PoE incorporated co-op multiplayer into its action, but this doesn’t mean Path of Exile 2 continues on the multiplayer co-op theme. Let’s see what the developer is cooking up.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-multiplayer-co-op">Is Path of Exile 2 Multiplayer Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 team, assemble! Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Good news! <strong>Path of Exile 2 features both online multiplayer and local couch co-op</strong> for you to enjoy the game with other people, either via wi-fi, or sitting next to someone.</p>



<p><strong>The confirmation comes from Grinding Gear Games itself</strong> via an official YouTube announcement trailer and the official FAQ.</p>



<h3 id="h-local-couch-co-op">Local Couch Co-op</h3>



<p>If you consult the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 frequently asked questions post</a>, under the query asking, “Is couch co-op available in Early Access?,” the answer says, “<strong>Yes, you can play Path of Exile 2 in couch co-op mode on a single account right from the start.</strong> The second player will be able to create a character on that account.”</p>



<p>No waiting around and no kerfuffle here—it’s immediate access to local <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-path-of-exile-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couch co-op</a> with a player of your choosing. Furthermore, the “Path of Exile 2 – Console Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games” trailer also confirmed couch co-op was slated for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-online-multiplayer-co-op">Online Multiplayer Co-op</h3>



<p>Hammering home the notion of online multiplayer and co-op for Path of Exile 2 is the announcement trailer I referenced above. The trailer says “<strong>Online multiplayer play requires PlayStation Plus membership</strong>.” It also mentions crossplay for Path of Exile 2 too—so you and your friends don’t need to play PoE 2 on the same format.</p>



<p>Check out the cool trailer below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-pledges-updates-for-delisted-games-as-warcraft-1-and-2-delisted.1049571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>are to be delisted from its storefront, but don't worry; the recently-announced Preservation Program has had its terms updated to account for occasions like this.</p>

<p>In a press release, GOG confirms that the two real-time strategy games will be removed from its store on December 13th, probably in light of the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>remasters that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor" rel="nofollow">leaked ahead of</a>, and were then confirmed during, the franchise's recent 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>

<p>However, in that same press release, GOG also announces a new feature for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Preservation Program</a>, an initiative that pledges to keep games updated for modern systems whether or not their developers are still supporting said games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=ggjhTDv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=_eOnWInZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>may be getting delisted from GOG, but you're in luck if you did happen to buy it via GOG's store.</figcaption></figure><p>GOG says that from now on, if a game joins the Preservation Program, it will be supported with updates and compatibility patches "even if it gets delisted from [GOG]".</p>

<p>Thankfully, since "from now on" begins today, that new feature will cover the two original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games, so if you did happen to buy them via GOG, you don't need to worry about them suddenly losing compatibility or support.</p>

<p>In fact, if you've yet to pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on GOG</a>, then you can currently do so using the discount code MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which knocks "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP, or 8 PLN off" your order.</p>

<p>It'll only work with those currencies, but as GOG points out, you can simply change your currency at the bottom of the store page if you're not currently working within one of the supported currencies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=2bzo0wgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=S0dA5ZlS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be entitled to a discount right now if you pick up the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games on GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>That code's only available to be used once for each user, though, so once it's gone, it's gone. Bear that in mind before you pick up the bundle.</p>

<p>Given that Activision Blizzard doesn't seem to be making the same promise of eternal compatibility and support for its own remastered&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles, you may want to grab these games via GOG if you're looking for peace of mind. We'll bring you more on this, and all other things GOG, as we get it.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>



<p>What do you think of Tencent buying another game studio? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

After January 30, 2025, the price will double.</p><p>The game has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-announced-arriving-in-december/1100-6527417/" data-ref-id="1100-6527417">same features as the previous edition</a>, as well as some new ones. For example, players can import their own custom designs from Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch. Players can assign the custom designs to clothing, and items like umbrellas, walkways, and flooring, among other things.</p><ul><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Download at iTunes</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa&amp;pli=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download at Google Play</a></li></ul><p>Anyone who already played Pocket Camp when it was free can continue their journey.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a>, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun's very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.</p>
<p>"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Aside from the USA and the British Isles, the DLC includes maps based on Austria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, France, Estonia and North Korea. "Every map will differ in terms of overall size and the challenges the local topography brings, and they will also come with pre-generated towns, cities, and infrastructure," the announcement release explains. "This will require players to mold and shape their nations over time in order to create a new wave of top-notch Soviet Republics."</p><p>I still haven't played Workers &amp; Resources, but I've greatly enjoyed reading Sin's articles about it. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-review">her review of the 1.0 version</a> from June 2024, she paints a simultaneously appealing and terrifying picture of a game where setting up a recycling service or demolishing a mine requires you to implement a whole infrastructure of specialised workers, vehicles and buildings (there are also plenty of options to simplify the simulation, if desired).</p>
<p>"I could recite a litany of frustrations and wishes, but it would be dwarfed by the novella about how absorbing and fascinating Workers &amp; Resources is," Sin wrote. "I love its conceptual commitment to a planned economy that its genremates observe de facto but don't examine. Its complex models and processes built for the joy and satisfaction of watching them come together. Its foundations in Slovak history and experience, and its refusal to be like anything else."</p>
<p>Sin also has a piece from a couple years back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">exploring how Workers &amp; Resources deviates from the liberal American idea of town-building epitomised by SimCity</a>. I imagine she'd be keen to see how the game stacks up when you actually transport it to North America, though I suspect there are mods that do this already. Sort of feels like the logical endgame here is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">go to space</a>. There are probably mods for that too.

</p><p>The Worlds Map DLC is out on 13th December via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, and will be localised into the same languages as the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-talking-s-about-us-half-life-2-mod-blacklists-a-handful-of-youtubers-as-anticitizens-and-blocks-them-from-playing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>There is some spiteful drama in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod is called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">Half-Life 2 Overcharged</a> and it is described by its creators as an "overhaul modification" with "brand new gameplay and post-processing features". It adds new Combine and alien enemies, plus a bunch of weapons. It was originally released in 2022 and attracted some ridicule from Half-Life modding fans for being underbaked. The enemy AI was broken, crashes were frequent, the weapons were underwhelming or needless, and there were plenty of lighting and graphical issues. </p>
<p>A lot of these problems were meticulously pointed out in videos by YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-v4twgwLR4p-g0mihJsLCw/about">"noclick"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RadiationHazardYT">"Radiation Hazard"</a>, who specialise in the Half-Life games and play a lot of mods for Valve's classic shooters. They didn't show any mercy in their judgement of this one, calling it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xhEXs9M3c">"overhyped"</a>, for example, and cutting down the mod in what you might call a typical YouTuber style. </p>
<p>In the two years since that original release the mod saw some updates, and the YouTubers followed along, tracking changes and sometimes doing follow-up videos to address <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkRD5mhAtQ">whether or not the bugs had been fixed</a>. Some things did get fixed, yes, but many other problems persisted, and new issues even came up, such as strange ragdoll behaviour and vanishing enemies. </p><p>With the recent release of a 2.0 version, the video makers set out to cover the mod once again, only to discover that it would simply crash. An error message would appear, reading: "STOP talking SH1T about us". And any attempt to make the game run was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>"The developers used my Steam ID to somehow block me from playing the mod," said one of the affected players in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvsbZ18izA">a video calling out the modders</a>. "There is a line of code somewhere that was specifically written to block my account from playing this mod."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mod appears to have been hardcoded to include a list of four "anticitizens" who will be unable to play, according <a href="https://x.com/Comrade_Waluigi/status/1863354606757069134">to this tweet that exposes the modder's code</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> is now in full swing and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">the mod's page on ModDB</a> is inundated with dozens of comments saying "The sun is leaking" - a reference to one of the mod's most recurring lighting glitches. I probably wouldn't have even heard of this mod if the creators had not been this bitter about the poor reception.</p><p>This is a very niche example of the act of blacklisting, which occurs in traditional games criticism as well. Kotaku has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293">blacklisted by Bethesda</a> in the past, for example, presumably for not writing positively enough about their games. We at RPS have never been told overtly by any publisher or developer that we're on a blacklist (why would they admit to that, after all?) but we can tell when it happens; a company becomes chronically uncommuncative, they are not forthcoming with review code, or refuse to answer our queries. Still, even the most bullish of developers have never actually programmed their games to boot out specific critical voices. That is  wild behaviour and, as you can see, it also backfires. No, smart devs save their codey shennanigans to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8256405.stm">catch pirates in funny ways</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1863505672601534943
</p></figure>







<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>



<p>What do you think of Terminal? Do you want to finally break free of Escape from Tarkov? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

					<p>I've played a lot of ARPGS throughout the years, from spending a disgusting amount of time in Path of Exile to dipping my toes into Diablo. However, all of them have that same feel that makes them enjoyable and has a unique aesthetic to the ARPG genre that isn't really seen in other genres. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-upcoming-echoes-update-changes-it-into-a-premium-game-with-offline-option/">Playing Wayfinder surprised me</a> because it doesn't feel like an ARPG to me, at least in the classic sense of the genre. Instead, to me, it felt more like the kind of game you'd see ported to mobile as a MOBA. It gave me similar vibes to Smite in terms of camera angles and movements, with a cartoonish art style similar to Fortnite or even Palia. Because of these factors, I found it very difficult to get immersed in a game like this.</p>
<p>While for a lot of people, the color scheme and vibrancy of Wayfinder is bound to draw people in, it just didn't for me. Instead, it was a game where I had to turn the brightness all the way down, as it was giving me a headache. This is definitely more of a 'me' problem, as I am sensitive to flashing lights and bright colors, but it was pretty excessive. In some ways, the game reminded me of Borderlands, especially when you were charged with taking out Goblins. Although the combat style is vastly different from something you'd see in Borderlands, the layout and environments felt similar to that of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you first open the game, you are hit with a lot of vibrant colors as the story is explained to you. Unfortunately, the story wasn't that memorable, and it wasn't something that I took an interest in during my time playing Wayfinder. For me, I bypassed the vast majority of the story and just tried to get stuck into the combat and exploration of the game, as that was what drew me in the most.</p>
<p>Wayfinder kind of suffers from a feeling of being generic. While the gameplay aspect is a lot of fun, there isn't much that is original. When I was first told about the game and the Critical Role collaboration, I was expecting something more akin to Divinity: Original Sin. Maybe I put my expectations a bit too high. I was expecting more of a roleplay element where you could have more impactful interactions with people and form bonds with the characters you meet, but that didn't seem like much of an option. The characters I spoke to were very well-developed, and they had hefty backstories, but it was hard to find any information about the character you're playing when in discussion with others. There's not really any witty banter or sprinkles of personality that showcase who the character is, regardless of who you choose.</p>
<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of the content, I found myself really enjoying the combat system of Wayfinder. I chose to play as Ness, the typical edgy-looking rogue. The character designs are all pretty stereotypical, but this didn't bother me too much. The playstyle was fun, albeit it was nothing overly new. Although the combat was a lot of fun and was easy to get stuck into, parrying was difficult. The parry window was very short, but it also shared a stamina bar with dodging and blocking. This made it very difficult not to take damage, as you may be able to dodge one attack and block another, but you could very quickly run out of stamina before being able to parry the third. My main issue with this was that the enemies often came thick and fast, or they'd be joined by a much stronger enemy, making an easy fight very tense and challenging. Despite that, the combat provided a much-needed thrill in the game, and it was fun being able to Shadow-step through enemies to destroy them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-gear-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gear system was a bit confusing, and I felt that it wasn't explained very well. While the gear was easy to find in your inventory, you'd find that you could also pick up gear for the other Wayfinders available to play. This made it a bit confusing for me at first, as I assumed any gear I'd pick up would be for my specific character. The upgrading system available was also a bit finicky to get used to, and you're immediately thrown into dungeons to collect resources that you have no idea how to use.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Wayfinder was pretty average. Unfortunately, nothing about the game stuck out, and there wasn't much that felt unique or groundbreaking. While the dungeons were a lot of fun, and the combat was the main thing that drew me in, it wasn't enough to keep me playing. Hopefully, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game continues to get updated</a>, new content and features will be added to improve the game.</p>

<p>There was nothing that stood out from the game, and the story didn't particularly grab me. The main selling point for me was the combat and dungeon-crawling, which was quite fun. However, Wayfinder still needs some work to give it that extra sparkle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Ryosuke Yoshida has quit NetEase's Ouka Studios in order to join Square Enix following reports of extensive layoffs at the former.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, Yoshida said that he quit Ouka Studios on October 31st, but that he's "grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support" in creating and releasing&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Describing the process of making the game as "a very good experience", Yoshida then says he "joined Square Enix in December", pledging to "do [his] best to make a game that many people can enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=qtg12jgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=y0G5Rvvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s director has jumped ship to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director's&nbsp;message drew responses from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1863423587774025919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>community manager John "Bucky" Buckley</a>, who said he's "looking forward to seeing what [Yoshida does] next", as well as <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1863419145943208328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi</a>, who welcomed Yoshida to the company.</p>

<p>Yoshida's decision comes a few months after a report claiming that Ouka Studio, the developer of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">hit by huge layoffs</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>

<p>According to that report, "all but a handful" of developers at Ouka were laid off, and parent company NetEase was planning to close down the studio. Of course, Yoshida doesn't confirm or deny this report, but the timing of his departure seems appropriate if it's true.</p>

<p>Ouka's apparent shutdown may also be coming from the same place as NetEase's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">decision to pull funding</a> from ex-BioWare writer Mac Walters' studio Worlds Untold, leading said studio to "pause operations" while it seeks an alternative source of funding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=BEuHYcP6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=GihojmDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yoshida's decision to leave&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s development team appears to have come at the right time.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible that Square Enix's willingness to hire Yoshida speaks to a desire for the studio to make a followup to&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, so this might not be the last we hear of the franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, Square Enix itself hasn't been having the best year. Back in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">the studio admitted</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>"did not meet [its] expectations", and in April, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup" rel="nofollow">declared a $140m loss</a> amid a major internal project shakeup.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/visions-of-mana/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/visions-of-mana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

The free-to-play mobile game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308337/so-long-campers">shut down on November 28th</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo">launching seven years ago</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225944/nintendo-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mobile-ending-date">Nintendo had plans to launch a new version</a> that would allow players to transfer their campgrounds to a new app that cuts out the microtransactions but requires a one-time paid fee. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281659/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-mobile-launch-date-introductory-price">Originally slated to launch on December 3rd</a>, the paid app — called <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> — is available now on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.zasa">Android</a>, for a launch price of $9.99.</p></div><p>The new version is largely the same as the original, and will still feature seasonal events and all of the other content from the base game. The biggest changes are the welcome removal of microtransactions and the ability to play offline. But the paid app also introduces a number of gameplay additions, including a new location where you can hang out with K.K. Slider, and the option to import custom designs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">the Switch game <em>New Horizons</em></a> into <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>. Here’s how it works:</p><p>While you can start up a fresh game if you haven’t played before, <em>Complete</em> seems largely designed so that existing players won’t lose all of their campground progress for good, making it an interesting solution for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">an ongoing problem with mobile and live service games</a>. Unfortunately, at launch the game seems to be having issues with save transfers, which Nintendo has acknowledged. “The issue may be occurring due to a high number of users attempting to use this service,” <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1863524631493382480">the company says</a>. If you’re having issues, you can check out the support page <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15997/kw/nintendo%20account#s3q4">right here</a>. Players have until June 2nd, 2025 to transfer saves.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Path of Exile 2 is the first proper PoE sequel, and ARPG fans are sharpening their swords at the prospect. If you’re interested in Path of Exile 2 on PC, we have the full system requirements, the minimum specs required to run it, and the recommended specs for tip-top gameplay.</p>



<p>Developer Grinding Gear Games hasn’t neglected Path of Exile, instead, it has spent the better part of a decade providing new expansions for the OG title. However, the time has come for a fully-fledged sequel to enter the game. Path of Exile 2 arrives 11 years after its predecessor, and I think I speak for all ARPG fans when I say the market needs fresh blood.</p>



<p>Blizzard’s Diablo 4 is undoubtedly king and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-release-delayed-due-to-technical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a> is set to continue the series’s dominance. Many fans of the genre are chomping at the bit for Path of Exile 2 though, and its system requirements and PC specs could be crucial factors in its success.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s intense, which is how we like it. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Minimum requirements always do what they say on the box. Path of Exile 2, in this case, has a bare minimum set of PC specs needing to be matched to play the free-to-play title at all. Being able to play is better than not, and I think you’ll be pleased to hear PoE 2’s minimum specs don’t demand the world.</p>



<p>Before we get into the specs, it’s <strong>highly recommended you have 3GB of VRAM</strong> to run Path of Exile 2 smoothly.</p>



<p>Here are all the Path of Exile 2 minimum requirements necessary to play the ARPG.</p>

<p>It’s now time to move onto the powerful end of the spectrum. Path of Exile 2 may be top-down and have vast, eye-opening landscapes and vistas, but it’s still a highly detailed title with a lot going on. To prevent your system from overheating or overexerting itself, it would be very handy to meet the recommended requirements to get the most out of PoE 2.</p>



<p>As an additional requirement this time, Solid State Storage is considered a must for the recommended requirements.</p>



<p>Check out the complete recommended requirements below.</p>
