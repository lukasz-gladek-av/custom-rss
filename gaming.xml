            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is preparing to launch an AI-powered Copilot for Gaming soon that will guide Xbox players through games and act as an assistant to download and launch games. Copilot for Gaming, as Microsoft is branding it, will be available through the Xbox mobile app initially and is designed to work on a second screen as a companion or assistant.</p><p>Microsoft is positioning Copilot for Gaming as a sidekick of sorts, one that will accompany you through games, offering up tips and guides and useful information about a game world. During a press briefing, Sonali Yadav, product manager for gaming AI, demonstrated several scenarios for what Copilot for Gaming could be used for. One involved a concept demo of Copilot assisting an <em>Overwatch 2</em> player by coaching them on the mistakes they made when trying to push without teammates.</p><p>In the <em>Overwatch 2</em> demo, Copilot could even recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team and tell you more about why you’d want to pair up particular characters, detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Another demo involved using Copilot with <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>, where you could ask Copilot questions about how to craft objects. Copilot can see your screen, so it can guide you and see exactly what you’re doing in a game. The demo also included the option to enable cheats in <em>Minecraft, </em>so Copilot could even tell you where certain crafting materials are located in the world.</p><p>The demos felt very concept in nature, and they won’t be available during the initial launch of Copilot for Gaming next month. Instead, Microsoft will test early versions of Copilot with Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app in April, before eventually bringing Copilot to multiple devices.</p><p>Microsoft also has a slick marketing video for its Copilot for Gaming effort, but none of it looks real world to me, so it’s difficult to understand exactly what the company will deliver to testers in April. It looks like Microsoft has the vision for where it wants Copilot on an Xbox to be in the future, and it says it will iterate based on feedback. But right now, I’ll be interested to see how this launches in a more limited fashion on mobile devices.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, Stitch, the not-dog alien that sets the events of the film into motion, looks fittingly hideous. I’m glad to hear they let the original movie’s director and lead actor, Chris Sanders, reprise his role as the little blue guy. However, one change that’s being made for this adaptation feels like it was done both to cut corners in the animation department and to allow for a cowardly pivot away from one of the original film’s best bits. I’m talking about swapping alien dynamic duo Jumba (Zach Galifianakis) and Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) out of their improvised human disguises into a more straightforward hologram that lets the film simply use the human actors.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the original film, Jumba and Pleakley are sent to Earth to retrieve Stitch, who escapes to the planet and crashlands in Hawaii. The two are very clearly alien and have to carry out their mission incognito. They do this by grabbing whatever human clothes they can to create disguises. The joke is that the two are clearly still aliens, but while Jumba looks like he just rolled out of bed and grabbed whatever was nearby, Pleakley is seen in elaborate outfits, typically in drag, with the two cosplaying as a married couple to blend in. He’s putting in the effort and can lip sync for his life at the drop of a hat.</p><p>Now, Disney is going a much more straightforward route for live-action. It looks like Jumba and Pleakley will be using holograms to appear human for parts of the film, allowing Galifianakis and Magnussen to be on-screen as the aliens’ “human” forms rather than just voicing the characters. The trade-off here is that not only is one of the original movie’s running gags lost in translation, but fans are annoyed that Pleakley is seemingly no longer in drag in the live-action adaptation. Some are saying this might just be a way to lower animation costs for the film, while others are more suspicious that it could be in reaction to something that was seen as a harmless gag 20 years ago but could now be read by the worst people you know as some kind of “woke” propaganda promoting same-sex relationships, drag, or cross-dressing.</p><p>Alongside the usual tomato-throwing from classic Disney fans who consider these live-action remakes uncreative cash grabs that devalue the original animated films, the <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>remake has also been the subject of a fair bit of bespoke controversy, with some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/lilo-and-stitch-casting-sparks-online-debate-colorism-hollywood-2023-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lilo-and-stitch-casting-sparks-online-debate-colorism-hollywood-2023-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusing the film of whitewashing</a></span> its Native Hawaiian characters. Inevitably, the movie will make half a billion dollars at the box office and no lessons will be learned. At least we’ll always have cunty Pleakley in the animated movie. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-one-photo-on-linkedin-has-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-fans-excited<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 real-time strategy series Dawn of War has been dormant ever since Relic Entertainment ended support for its failed 2017 effort, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii">Dawn of War 3</a>. Still, the first two games remain much-loved by fans, who have wondered ever since whether a Dawn of War 4 or maybe even remakes of either Dawn of War 1 or 2 might be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after a single photo was published to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, Dawn of War fans have hope that something new in the series is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Relic Entertainment itself, which recently gained independence from prior owner Sega via investment from Emona Capital. Emona managing partner Dominik Dolenec published a selfie to LinkedIn showing him standing outside Games Workshop’s Nottingham headquarters and the mecca that is Warhammer World. Yes, that’s a statue of a Space Marine in the background. It’s awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The foreground is more interesting, however. Dolenec is wearing a Relic Entertainment T-shirt for his trip to Games Workshop, and so it can be reasonably assumed that he’s in town representing the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Great visit to Games Workshop PLC in Nottingham,” Dolenec said. “Many thanks to Owen Rees for sharing the Warhammer magic with us! Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come. 💪🎮”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Owen Rees is Group Head of Licensing at Games Workshop. He’s worked on a number of Warhammer video games, and leads the licensing of video games and consumer products for all Warhammer products. It’s also worth noting those emojis at the end of Dolenec’s comment. This very much reads like a video game business meeting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can imagine the speculation. Dawn of War 4 is top of the wishlist, it seems, but perhaps remakes of Dawn of War 1 and / or 2 are on the cards instead. Let’s be optimistic and suggest a brand new game and remakes are all in the works. Why not?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what we know: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop is on the hunt for the next big Warhammer video game hit</a> after the hugely successful, 5 million-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> changed everything for developer Saber Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping £18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to £30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million). Earned income, which is the key figure here, was £26.1 million (approx. $31.8 million), up from £5.9 million (approx. $7.2 million), an increase Games Workshop said was mainly from Space Marine 2. 98% of Games Workshop’s total licensing revenue came from PC and console games (Space Marine 2 launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A win all round, then, but Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from? It seems inevitable that Saber Interactive will get the chance to continue the Space Marine story with Space Marine 3, and indeed has said it has ideas for a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 has never been bigger. Amazon’s Space Marine 2 animation, released as part of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level">Secret Level</a> anthology series, went down well with fans. And there’s huge excitement about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 projects in the works for Amazon</a>, although they're years away. Creative Assembly is reportedly working on a Warhammer 40,000 Total War game (finally!), although it is apparently years away. Could a revival of Dawn of War scratch that strategy itch in the meantime?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p dir="ltr">While GameCube games never came to the Nintendo Switch Online service like many hoped, a few GameCube games managed to join the Switch's library in the form of ports, remakes, and remasters.

            <title><![CDATA[Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-did-no-one-tell-me-duolingo-is-like-this.1133487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You might recall that I’m taking an <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish language</a> class. In our first class this week, the teacher suggested getting Duolingo for vocabulary-building; while the general consensus seems to be that Duolingo is <a href="https://thegeekygaeilgeoir.wordpress.com/tag/duolingo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shit</a> for Irish pronunciation, it <em>is</em> full of words, and I don’t know very many words yet and would like to know more. So I got Duolingo. I hate Duolingo.</p><p>I might be the only person in the world who has never screwed around with Duolingo, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309785/duolingo-owl-mascot-lives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owl-based</a> language-learning app that I mostly only know from when people post funny sentences from it on social media. I actually didn’t even know it was free until our teacher told us it was, which definitely made it more appealing. So I installed it on my phone, selected “Irish,” and dove in.</p><p>To my deeply limited knowledge, the Irish pronunciation is hit or miss. Some words sound fine, while others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/12dfegv/new_irish_voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer voices</a> that even I, a total beginner, know aren’t quite right. I spend a lot of time checking any new word Duolingo says at me against <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teanglann</a> or <a href="https://abair.ie/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abair</a>, which provide pronunciation in the different dialects. Additionally, some of the grammatical things it’s shown me so far feel under-explained– I was thrown by the app’s “Labhraím Gaeilge” for “I speak Irish” instead of the “Tá Gaeilge agam” (literally, “I have Irish”) that I’ve heard before; looking up <a href="https://duonotes.fandom.com/wiki/Irish#:~:text=When%20talking%20about%20languages%20in,of%20the%20English%20%22speak%22.&amp;text=2)%20%22I%20speak%20Irish%22,the%20knowledge%20of%2C%20the%20language." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it’s different</a> actually taught me useful grammar information. But this learning feels like a side effect of me being a nerd rather than Duolingo’s intention, especially since it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/18qenxv/has_duolingo_removed_all_learning_material/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t give me</a> any of this context in the app itself.</p><p>Anyway, I am a complete beginner at this language and will not presume to correct a long-standing app with facts I’ve Googled, so I’ll move on to what I can confidently hate about Duolingo, which is: everything about Duolingo. Why did no one tell me it’s like this?! When I opened it for the first time I was instantly inundated with <em>shit</em>: XP and stars and gems and hearts and flames, many of which, like the Irish lessons themselves, it doesn’t really explain. At first, I kept trying to figure out how to <em>use</em> my XP to, I don’t know, level up, before realizing it functions more like points. I did not understand why I was pursuing these chests full of “gems” or what the gems were for. When I first started using the app, I didn’t understand what counted as completing an activity toward my “streak,” since each little circle has multiple lessons attached to it, so I just kept going until I asked a friend online when I was allowed to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole concept of “hearts,” lives that you lose if you make a mistake until you lose them all and can’t go through lessons anymore, makes a kind of sense for a video game or a gamified app, but as a learning tool just makes me afraid to fuck up. While they do encourage you to slow down and think about your answer, they also feel like bad design for a <em>learning</em> app, and one that sometimes teaches you new words through guessing. I feel like I’m being punished for being a learner, and I will thoroughly cop to cheating on occasion by doublechecking the spelling challenges before committing to them. Irish is a difficult language to spell, especially as a new learner coming from English, and it pissed me off to no end to have to stop learning new words because I couldn’t spell the Irish word for “salad,” a word that God willing I will never have to spell. (It’s “sailéad,” which I suppose Duolingo has indeed taught me to spell, but only through fucking up, the thing Duolingo punishes you for!)&nbsp;</p><p>People on social media and in our Discord warned me away from Duolingo’s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/duolingo-turned-me-into-a-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaderboards</a> and “leagues,” which only made me want to know about them more. I’m currently top of the “Bronze” level Irish leaderboard thanks to my amount of XP, and I can see its insidious appeal; I absolutely do not want to engage in this cursed feature and turn my learning into a competition against strangers, but also damned if I’m not gonna beat the person below me. There are apparently all kinds of <a href="https://103percent.blogspot.com/2023/12/competitive-duolingo-is-miserable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tricks</a> you can employ to game the leaderboards, which I feel mostly confident I am never going to do, but I <em>have</em> found myself clicking the ugly brown trophy icon multiple times a day to check if I’m still comfortably ahead of the second-place user. But the only way to increase my distance is to get more XP by playing more, and the only way to play more is to not fuck up and lose all my hearts, which just incentivizes me to cheat.</p><p>Or, as Duolingo so obviously wants me to do, to pony up for its paid version, which has unlimited hearts and other features. This is clearly the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1fprso6/duo_lingo_has_officially_ruined_their_app_by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason</a> Duolingo is like this; rather than offering me something good for my money, it makes the free version so crappy that the paid version sounds like the “real” app. There are <em>so</em> many ads, mostly for the paid version of Duolingo, but others for <a href="https://aftermath.site/so-i-dont-totally-hate-those-hero-wars-ads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shitty mobile games</a>. You can watch ads to earn more hearts, and some of them ask you to interact with them, playing parts of mindless mobile games. Perhaps unpopularly, or as a side effect of being an old person who used to watch TV before streaming, I don’t as a life rule hate ads; my time is not so valuable that 10 seconds makes a difference to me. But the ploy is so naked, the app so clearly enshittified, that the ads infuriate me, because the actual thing being advertised by every ad suggesting I pay for Duolingo is just how to have a less shitty experience with Duolingo.</p><p>But the real problem is that, despite yelling “what the fuck?!” in my first five minutes with a program I always imagined was a regular learning tool and not some kind of gamification limbo, I am already utterly trapped in its stupidest bits. I don’t care about its XP beyond my growing obsession with the leaderboard, but I absolutely <em>crave </em>pressing the buttons and hearing the sounds and watching the circles fill in. It feels like the dumb mobile games it foists on me in ads, mindless and shallow and disgustingly satisfying. I keep using it? playing it? even when it’s long stopped “teaching” me anything and I’m just repeating things I’ve been shown in previous lessons or choosing an answer from the only new word on offer. My nerve endings <em>love</em> the stupid chime sound of getting an answer correct; I feel like I’m good at Irish when I 100% a lesson, even though the achievement comes from the app’s design instead of actual language knowledge. It is the most naked, blatant bullshit, and I am disgusted with myself by how I’m <em>so</em> fucking here for it.</p><p>Right now, I have one heart left that I’m determined to bank, but I keep picking up my phone and poking impatiently around the app for something to do, the kind of compulsion I’ve never felt for other apps on my phone. I fucking <em>hate</em> it; the whole thing is vapid and greedy and aimless, but <em>jesus christ </em>I want to keep pressing the buttons. I resent–&nbsp;</p><p>OK, literally in the middle of typing the above sentence I got an alert purporting to be from the person below me on the leaderboards, who has apparently overtaken me. The alert told me to “Earn more XP to reclaim your reward chest” (what is my reward chest? Is it something to do with the leaderboard?) and I did so <em>immediately</em>, without even thinking about it and even though I was busy doing my actual job. I played through a tedious review, and in my impatience I got something wrong and lost my last heart. I actually gasped in shock, while Duolingo immediately told me I could pay to keep playing, <em>which I am not going to do no matter how much it asks</em>. But now someone else is sitting above me on the leaderboards, and I am furious at them, even though I 100% do not actually care about this in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>Fuck you, Duolingo, and the five hours and 41 minutes until I idle my way into a heart to keep playing you. (<em>Playing?</em>) The most useful thing you’ve taught me so far is what a fucking rube I am, though also where to find the accent marks on my iPhone keyboard.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/severance-theories-lumon-goats-clones-instagram-threads"><h3>Threads Won’t Stop Showing Me Dogshit Severance Theories</h3></a><p>"I think I know what Lumon does.

		<p>We’ve always been huge Futurlab fans here at TheSixthAxis, and it’s nice to have a bit of Thursday action from the team behind Velocity and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>. For fans of spraying things down, bringing things up to a sheen and climbing on small footladders to see onto ledges, today is a good day, with the announcement of PowerWash Simulator 2, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First and foremost, all that soaking action will look better than ever, with an improved set of visuals, a whole new campaign and, of course, new locations and items for you to clean down. The new campaign will have you uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries, as well as have you visiting grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a new home space – presumably you can clean this up too – and here you’ll be able to display awards and trinkets that you’ve gained while doing a hard days cleaning.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, you can now share campaign progression online together for the first time, and in addition to online play, split-screen co-op will be available as well, meaning you can clean digital homes together, while neglecting your own.</p>


<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>
<p>Futurlab have promised more details in April, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for all your PowerWash Simulator 2 news.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom has published a new exploration trailer for the upcoming massive multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. The video goes through the basic progression every character will have to go through after crash-landing on Arrakis: first, surviving, crafting a stillsuit, founding a home base, and making vehicles to roam the desert planet.</p>
<p>Eventually, players will venture to the biggest and most dangerous map, the Deep Desert. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> earlier by Game Director Joel Bylos, this huge map can house hundreds of players at once and is always PvP enabled.</p>
<p><em>The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>
<p>In today's trailer, Funcom also remarked that the Deep Desert map will reset every week, explained in-world by the massive Coriolis Storms, which will sweep over the map and change it. This also means Dune Awakening players will then get to explore as if it were new when it comes to its points of interest and resource nodes. It's even possible for explorer types of players to get in there just after the reset, survey the map, and then either share it with allies and clan members or sell it on the Exchange, the game's version of the traditional MMO-style auction house.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game will launch on PC in a little over two months. Its benchmark and character creator tool are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on Steam, though.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Crikey, it's still looking rough out there in the industry at the moment, isn't it folks? Yesterday unfortunately brought the news that another online game is shutting down, with the studio alongside it. In this version of the story that we've heard all too often recently, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spectre-divide">Spectre Divide</a>, a tactical free-to-play first-person shooter whose whole gimmick is that you control your own character and a clone, allowing you to switch between them on the fly.</p>
<p>It was certainly a fresh take on the genre, but our former reviews editor Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spectre-divide-is-a-new-tactical-shooter-with-one-big-gimmick-controlling-two-bodies-at-once">did wonder if that was enough to set it apart from Valorant or Counter Strike</a>. As evidenced by developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/mountaintop-studios">Mountaintop Studios</a>' imminent closure only six months after the game launched, it was not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The studio shared the news on the official Spectre Divide X (formerly Twitter) account, with a lengthy message explaining that the game hasn't found enough growth in the two weeks since season 1 launched. Essentially, it all came down to the fact that there simply weren't enough players and revenue to "cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio." 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
As of right now, Mountaintop expect to take Spectre offline sometime within the next 30 days, with new purchases now disabled, and if you've spent any money on the game since season 1 launched you'll be getting a refund too.
</p>
<p>
Mountaintop also noted that they did everything they could to keep the game going by bringing on a publisher, finding additional funding, or even getting themselves outright acquired. The post also points to some "tough stumbles" at Spectre Divide's launch that may have contributed to the closure. There was clearly some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/4570678714934677865?l=english">strong feedback early on in relation to the cost of things like weapons and characters</a>, which prompted the developer to apologise and make price cuts.</p>
<p>
Still, there's no denying that it's a bad time for live service projects like this, even if you do all the right things, and have a genuinely unique idea. Spectre Divide has at least fared better than Sony's paid hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">lasted a whole three weeks before being taken offline forever</a>. Here's hoping all the Mountaintop devs can land on their feet.

Or maybe this really is part of some wild reinterpretation of The Odyssey and Odysseus’ son Telemachus, seemingly played by Tom Holland, just happens to run into some Vikings on his quest to find his lost father.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-e5-e99-in-closed-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Tuesday night, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the first to report</a> of microtransactions being added to the closed alpha playtest of EA Skate. Now, just a couple days later, we have an idea at what EA is charging for their San Van Bucks (SVB) within the game.</p>



<p>Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/CkGNDr3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sm1one_out_there</a>, it appears that EA is charging users a range of €5-€99—the prices shared are in Euros, but the conversion for microtransactions is usually similar to USD, so expect $5-$99—for the in-game currency. </p>



<p>At €5, you get 500 SVB. At €9.99, that jumps to 1050 SVB including a 5% boost in the amount you receive. The rest of the options are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>€24.99 – 3,000 SVB</li>



<li>€49.99 – 6,250 SVB</li>



<li>€99.99 – 13,000 SVB</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on other images shown, as well as previously announced plans by EA, all of the microtransaction purchases go towards in-game cosmetics. There are no pay-to-win mechanics coming to EA Skate.</p>



<p>An example of item costs include 200 SVB for socks, 300 SVB for board art, and 400 SVB for a tank top.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the microtransactions are currently only being added to PC and PlayStation players during the playtest. EA and Full Circle will also cease giving players “random grants of SVB” that it had been doing in prior playtests. </p>



<p>They also reaffirmed that “any SVB purchased will be credited back at Early Access launch” provided you are using the same EA account for both playtests and Early Access. Lastly, it was confirmed that items acquired during the playtest will also be reset at Early Access launch, but not during the playtest itself.</p>

We have no timeframe or news there.”</p><p>“<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> feels like a natural evolution from its predecessor,” said FuturLab design director Dan Chequer in a press release. “The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean. <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements. We’re really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure.”</p><p>FuturLab chief operating officer Chris Mehers added, “We couldn’t be more thrilled to finally announce the sequel to one of our most successful titles. With over 17 million players worldwide, <em><a title="Games > PowerWash Simulator [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a></em> has allowed us to self-publish a sequel, an exciting challenge we are delighted to undertake.

Nintendo will open an official Nintendo store in San Francisco this May, and it's just the second Nintendo store in the United States. The other one is in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.</p><p>The San Francisco store is located in the city's Union Square area at 331 Powell Street. The store will be stocked with Nintendo game consoles and games, along with accessories, apparel, home goods, and souvenirs that are only available at the San Francisco location.</p><p>It seems fans won't just be able to walk into the store when it opens on May 15. Nintendo said there will be "reservation requirements," and more details will be shared in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Fans can enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip to the grand opening event for the Nintendo San Francisco store on May 15. The sweepstakes offers up a three-night, four-day trip for you and up to two guests.</p><p>The contest is open to US residents who are 18 or older. To enter, fans must have a Nintendo Account and can <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">redeem 10 Platinum Points to enter</a>, with a limit of five entries per person.

            <p>
Relaxing cleaning sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> is getting a full-blown sequel, and it's due out this year. Eurogamer can also confirm the game will launch on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will soak into PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows Store, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025, with more details of the Switch 2 version to follow.
</p>
<p>
British studio FuturLab has come up with several major improvements for this new iteration, including four-player online co-op with shared progression, as well as a two-player local splitscreen option.

<p>
The game will also now feature a Central Homebase hub for your PowerWash business, which you can customise with various furnishings, and show off collectible rewards.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will feature a full new campaign, picking up where the original's truly wacky ending left off (no spoilers here, scrub). That means heading back to the filthy town of Muckingham and its surrounding Caldera County for more filth-ridden jobs.
</p>
<p>
These include a parade float, tram and teapot house, a quick initial look at the game has revealed. PowerWash Simulator 2's visuals have also clearly had a scrub up, and there's mention of a new soaping system where you can cover an area and quickly rinse away even the toughest grubbiness.
</p>
<p>There are "no plans" currently for a VR version, FuturLab told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>
FuturLab says more than 17 million players have played the original PowerWash Simulator to date, and experienced its relaxing gameplay and dopamine-inducing 'pings' when sections are complete. I can't wait for more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mountaintop Studios has announced that its free-to-play first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>is to shut down soon, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors.</p>

<p>Per a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/544477779605849692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>will cease service "within the next 30 days". Mountaintop will also be disabling any new in-game purchases and refunding any money players have spent since the launch of the game's first season a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>The studio says that this season's launch "hasn't achieved the level of success [it] needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat", so not only will the game be stopping service, but the studio will be shutting down "at the end of this week".</p>

<p>However, the studio says it hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue" to cover either the game's operation or the day-to-day running of the company, and that it's "stretched [its] remaining capital as far as [it] could".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that it's tried everything, from finding a new publisher through seeking additional investment and even "an acquisition", but that "in the end, we weren't able to make it work".</p>

<p><em>Spectre Divide</em>'s situation is sad, but it's far from unique. Just a week or two ago, Phoenix Labs announced its&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">will shut down in May</a>, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">not just smaller studios either</a>.</p>




<p>Mountaintop's closure is also part of a wider industry wave that has seen studios like&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">Monolith</a>, the Seattle-based <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow"><i>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</i>division of NetEase</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">multiple Ubisoft branches</a>&nbsp;affected.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If one can be said to feel sorry for an F1 team, I feel sorry for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton is starting the 2025 F1 campaign with Ferrari after enjoying one of the greatest runs in the sport's history with the Silver Arrows team. Six drivers and seven constructors championships. 84 race wins, the equivalent of four complete F1 seasons spent on the top step of the podium wearing a Mercedes uniform. And now, for his F1 career's final act, he's wearing red.</p><p>It feels like only Ferrari could’ve drawn Hamilton away from a team with which he had become synonymous; that no matter what Mercedes meant to Hamilton, no matter what they’ve accomplished together, Mercedes is still not Ferrari. If you’re one of the great F1 drivers and you have the chance to go to be a Ferrari driver, you go. Thirty-five years after his death, the Commendatore still has the power to summon drivers to Maranello.</p><p>There’s a clip that made the rounds, shorty after Hamilton's move was announced, of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufB9B1WRxTs&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Sebastian Vettel talking about the Catholic nature</u></a> of the Ferrari brand, back in his days with the team, specifically calling out people who work for Mercedes as being crypto-Ferrari fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Except brand feels like the wrong word. People who talk about the “brand” are usually in the business of relating to things as commodities, and they use the word to transform emotion and identity into a quantifiable asset, the same way “content” is used to reduce art and storytelling to an interchangeable slurry meant to fill people’s time. Ferrari is a triumph of branding because the company has never felt like it’s calculating enough to think like that. It inefficiently produces high-maintenance sports cars that look and sound so beautiful that reason and practicality are silent in the face of them. People who are convinced that everyone who drives a Audi or McLaren is a rich asshole will at the same time buy a Ferrari shirt or keychain because the allure of the dream is stronger than the reality that only plutocrats can truly live it.</p><figure></figure><p>The team occupies such a special place in Formula 1 that it used to receive <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a1882991/850-million-f1-question-why-ferrari-red-bull-receive-more-prize-money-mercedes/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>tens of millions of dollars annually</u></a> from F1, just because of the name. Whenever tensions with the sport’s governing bodies boil over, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12474/10100578/ferrari-threaten-to-quit-f1-as-sport-races-towards-epic-power-battle?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ferrari threatens to quit</u></a>, which is taken very seriously because it is, or was, the one team that is basically synonymous with the sport itself.</p><p>Whether Ferrari is <em>that</em> good a racing team doesn’t matter. Too much can be made at times of Ferrari mistakes, but you can’t deny that the team has struggled at times to interpret and react to the twists and turns of an F1 race. Where other teams might be angrily questioned by their drivers over the radio, Ferrari and its drivers would engage in discursive negotiations at 190 mph.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the sneers and disdain its detractors have for Ferrari during its down periods is something else though: expectation. It’s worse if Ferrari has a bad year or decade because, on some level, everybody expects this team to be great in a way they don’t expect of similarly storied teams like McLaren or Williams. Every team struggles, but Ferrari is treated as if every bad result reflects underlying moral failings that are disturbing the natural order.</p><p>After the mounting frustration and disenchantment that characterized Fernando Alonso’s and Sebastian Vettel’s periods with the team, it seemed like Ferrari’s spell should finally have been broken. Two era-defining talents had each gone there expecting to win a lot of races and at least a couple championships, and each had seen their fortunes wane while Red Bull and Mercedes became F1’s foremost teams. Now Hamilton is testing his own luck. Or maybe he's testing something else.</p><p>Because beyond the pragmatic reasons why Hamilton might have chosen to move on—Mercedes' lackluster results with a series of joyless cars, Ferrari's improving form, the king's ransom Hamilton is rumored to be paid—there's something priceless that Ferrari could offer that Mercedes never could: a fresh start. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new report claims Xbox’s upcoming gaming handheld is being developed in partnership with Asus.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-and-asus-partner-up">Xbox and Asus Partner Up</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft was working on a partner gaming handheld for 2025 called Project Kennan. Now, through a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, we know that Xbox is partnering with Asus on the project. The device will be similar to the Asus ROG Ally but with “an Xbox-y twist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Xbox x Asus gaming handheld will seemingly follow a more ‘Xbox style’, featuring an Xbox Guide button that was reported earlier. However, it is unclear whether the device will be a separate SKU from the ROG Ally 2 or be a version of that device, which is “subsidised by Xbox”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also tells us that the Xbox x Asus handheld will not play Xbox games, as it is “a tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Players will have the same access as they have on the Asus ROG Ally, being able to play games from Xbox Play Anywhere, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. At the same time, they can also use other stores such as Steam, Epic Games Stores and launchers like Riot on the upcoming handheld.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-project-kennan-specs-price-and-more">Project Kennan Specs, Price and More</h2>



<p>The report also discusses the specifications, price, and other details of the Xbox x Asus gaming handheld. The device could use an AMD Z2 Go or a Z2 extreme chipset. The cost, which has to be taken with a massive grain of salt, could be between $499 and $599 for the base model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Microsoft wants the upcoming handheld to resemble the Xbox as closely as possible, and it will exist “as a proof of concept of sorts.” The Xbox apps are being redesigned to be better optimised on small screens, and the Xbox Game Bar also received an update recently to make it look more like an Xbox rather than a Windows PC.</p>



<p>In other news, a next-gen Xbox console is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for 2027</a>. According to claims, the next console might <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not be a traditional one</a>. What are your thoughts on the Xbox x Asus handheld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
