              <p><em>The Outfoxies</em> arrives on consoles 30 years later. Tencent invests in its own version of <em>Ready or Not</em>. And could we finally get a <em>Kingdom Three Crowns</em>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. All I can think about right now is how there’s a perfect <em>Simpsons</em> screenshot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/backpagepod.bsky.social/post/3ma6eg5h26c2a">for every major game</a> released in 2025. And no one had to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danarndtwrites.bsky.social/post/3mabjnlygj22d">use AI to make them</a>.</p>    <p>Activision <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001351763375325384%7Ctwgr%5E50868c1df8a9b754e43f660097df3e98a413ed04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded%2F1100-6537059%2F">teased</a> the latest post-apocalyptic<em> Call of Duty</em> crossover with silhouettes of the Amazon show’s main characters, including Walton Goggins’ Ghoul and Aaron Moten’s Maximus in his Brotherhood Power Armor. The skins come just in time for the release of <em>Fallout</em> season 2 and an underwhelming launch for <em>Black Ops 7</em>. It’s not yet clear if players who want to run around Nuketown in Power Armor will be able to unlock it as part of the event pass or need to buy it separately.</p> <h2>Two years later, viral police-cam-footage game gets a big backer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bodycam-fps-police-shooting-unrecord-unreal-engine-1850358473"><em>Unrecord</em> blew up</a> thanks to a 2023 trailer that made the FPS look almost indistinguishable from a found-footage movie. The game that some were skeptical even really existed is now being funded by Tencent. Will it be the next <em>Ready or Not</em>?</p> <p>“In Tencent, we’ve found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision,” Theo Hiribarne wrote (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/unrecord/bodycam-fps-game-tencent-backing"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in <em>Unrecord</em> early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>

 <h2>A cult arcade classic comes to home consoles 30 years later</h2>  <p><em>The Outfoxies</em>, a Namco arena fighter for arcades that was directed by <em>Soul Calibur</em> producer Masuya Ohishi<em>,&nbsp;</em>is finally playable on modern machines. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-cult-namco-arcade-game-which-may-have-inspired-smash-bros-has-been-given-its-first-ever-home-release/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that the game was potentially one of the inspirations behind Nintendo’s own platform fighter <em>Smash Bros</em>. The new Arcade Classics version from Hamster Corporation is single-player on Switch 1 and PS4 but has split-screen and additional modes on Switch 2 and PS5.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo wins a 15-year-old lawsuit over the Wii Remote</h2> <p>It sued BigBen Interactive, now owned by Nacon, for infringing on its Wii Remote technology with unlicensed third-party controllers. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"><em>The Games Fray</em> reports</a> that Nintendo secured $8.2 million in damages in a recent ruling after years of BigBen successfully delaying proceedings. Nacon will still appeal the ruling, however, so this cold case will drag on a bit more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Larian employees have responded to the CEO’s recent comments about AI, with one saying, “Show your employees some respect.” </p>



<p>Larian has been a hot topic in the news lately and not always for the best reasons. Last week, we saw Larian reveal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity</a>, which brought some hype into the fan base. However, a few days ago, the Larian boss’s comments on AI caught fire on social media, and now former employees are responding. </p>







<h2 id="h-former-employee-claims-larian-boss-is-lying-about-staff-being-okay-with-ai-use">Former Employee Claims Larian Boss is Lying About Staff Being Okay with AI Use</h2>



<p>For a few days, Larian has been taking flak for using AI. Swen Vincke, the founder, stated, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/show-your-employees-some-respect-former-baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-devs-claim-larian-heads-are-lying-about-people-being-okay-with-using-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a former employee has responded to the comment, stating that Larian is lying about everyone in the company being okay with it. </p>



<p>Anne Méthot, a former QA tester at Larian on <a href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has stated that, after working at Larian, they aren’t surprised by the new AI stuff, alleging that Swen Vincke is “lying about people being okay with it”. Another former employee, Selena Tobin, has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they “loved working at Larian studios until AI”. Tobin asked the developers to show their employees some respect, as they are world-class and “do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.” </p>



<p>Swen Vincke has already posted on X to say they aren’t “pushing hard” to replace concept artists with AI. A new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> also states that their “successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make. In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.” Larian will hold an Ask Me Anything after the holiday break to provide more insight. </p>







<p>In other news, new Divinity will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn-based and co-op gameplay</a> and plans to follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format as previous Larian games</a>.

<p>Once again, the Switch 2 is absolutely dominating the competition, selling another 190,944 units to result in a current total of 3,362,777. The PS5 Digital Edition, meanwhile, is certainly benefitting from the recent price cut in Japan, but its 12,671 units sold wasn't enough to bag second place. That honour goes to the Switch Lite, which managed 14,885.</p>
<p>Combined sales of the Switch is 31,344, while the PS5 managed 18,912.</p>

            <guid>1387444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Three Fields Entertainment, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">founded by former Burnout developers</a> who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">released the open-world sandbox racer</a> Wreckreation, a game where you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">edit your race track and the world around you with a press of a button</a>, has launched a Patreon page to help keep the studio alive.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">launch this past October</a> was a commercial disappointment for Three Fields Entertainment, with players criticizing the myriad of technical issues and a lack of content at launch. It was so poor that a little over a month after launch, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">announced via a LinkedIn post that the entire studio's staff had been put on redundancy notice</a>, meaning they could all be laid off if things didn't improve.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark</em>," Sperry wrote in her post at the top of December. "<em></em><em>We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form.</em>"</p>



<p>That hasn't happened as of yet, but what has happened is that Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/u10680381">has launched a Patreon page to try to keep the studio alive</a>. The studio announced the Patreon page with <a href="https://x.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, which it says was created as a response to players who asked how they could support the studio.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing the Three Fields Entertainment Patreon‼️</p><p>Following our post on December 4th so many of you have asked how you can support us and we’re pleased to announce that we now have a direct way to do that! We have four tiers to choose from, with various rewards for each. More… <a href="https://t.co/3m0PfxrVTo">pic.twitter.com/3m0PfxrVTo</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Patreon helps us keep our 10 person development team together and continue updating Wreckreation with the speed and responsiveness you've already seen</em>," the Patreon page reads, "<em>and we're doing this now because the next few months are crucial</em>."</p>



<p>The Patreon page continues to be, seemingly, very transparent about the realities that Three Fields is facing. The studio estimates it needs about $65,000 a month to keep the team together and the studio alive. It's currently looking for additional funding by trying to find new partners and pitching new projects, but we've seen studios shut down or, at the very least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/">incur serious layoffs</a> while they look for funding from a new partner.</p>



<p>It's a difficult time <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">across the video games industry</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/keybanc-we-believe-intel-has-won-the-gpu-gaming-socket-for-the-nintendo-switch-3-on-18a-and-amd-faces-increasing-risks-from-a-price-war-with-intel/">across the tech industry overall</a>, with layoffs, studio shut-downs, and the constant concern of both happening hanging over the heads of developers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look out, Neytiri, you’ve got some competition in the form of a yellow talking sponge that lives under the sea and wears pants that are quite square in shape. At least that’s what Rotten Tomatoes indicates, with the site showing <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> performing worse with critics than a bunch of films that might surprise you.</p> <p>Releasing December 19 nationwide, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> continues the story of those blue cat alien people on that planet that looks like the coolest Unreal Engine 5 demo you’ve ever seen. This time, however, there are other alien cat people who aren’t all chill and into nature. These wild ones are into fire and destruction, and are causing chaos in the third entry in the blockbuster series. But perhaps more chaotic than that is the fact that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is sitting at 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</a> with 187 reviews, a drop compared to past installments. The first <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 sits at 81 percent and its 2022 sequel, <em>Way of Water</em>, has a solid 76 percent. I wonder if the lack of a big gap between releases and the tech not seeming as wild in this latest film has hurt perceptions of it.</p>

 <p>Here are some recent films that have higher Rotten Tomatoes scores. And yeah, RT is just an aggregation site and shouldn’t be treated as the gospel, but a lower score might throw a wrench in the works for the third <em>Avatar</em> movie, hurting its chances of making the billions the past films have, though I fully expect it to still do gangbusters over the weekend.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair – 100%</em></li> <li><em>The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Zootopia 2 – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Thunderbolts – 88%</em></li> <li><em>Bad Guys 2 -87%</em></li> <li><em>Predator Badlands – 86%</em></li> <li><em>Superman – 83%</em></li> <li><em>Dog Man – 82%</em></li> <li><em>Ballerina: From the World of John Wick – 75%</em></li> <li><em>Black Phone 2 – 72%</em></li> <li><em>Lilo + Stitch – 72%</em></li> </ul> <p>So yeah, the latest <em>Avatar</em> movie is losing critically to the newest <em>SpongeBob</em> movie. Perhaps movie critics just love that new tie-in song from Ice Spice, “Big Guy.”</p>  <p>Or perhaps SpongeBob truly is the big guy, and indeed, when compared to Cameron and his blue cat people, his pants are okay. But hey, at least Cameron can take solace in the fact that<em> Avatar 3</em> is better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><em>Wicked: For Good.</em> </a>Oh, and the fact that this new <em>Avatar</em> installment is likely to be the biggest movie of the year, like the past films were in 2009 and 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has announced a new 60 FPS update for The Division on PS5, making the game better suited for current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>In 2025, all we have heard about the Tom Clancy’s Division franchise is details on the sequel. Last we heard about the game was in August, when we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-year-7-roadmap-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 7 Roadmap</a>, and it was also revealed that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘saved’ by a team of 5 developers</a>. Now, towards the end of the year, a new announcement has arrived for the 2016 The Division game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-now-has-60-fps-on-ps5">The Division Now Has 60 FPS on PS5</h2>



<p>Revealed by a new post on <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Tom Clancy’s The Division is the latest 2016 title to receive a current-gen update in 2025. However, the new update only increases the framerate to 60 FPS; there are no details about the resolution. The blog post states that players can expect smoother gameplay in the snow-covered streets of New York thanks to the enhanced performance. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agents, The Division is now available on PlayStation 5 with enhanced performance at 60 FPS. This update brings smoother gameplay to the snow-covered streets of New York where it all began. <a href="https://t.co/NGWkp0brvn">pic.twitter.com/NGWkp0brvn</a></p>— Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Tom Clancy’s The Division centers on a deadly pandemic that has struck New York City. You are part of a unit of tactical agents that are trained to operate independently to save society. The title features a massive co-op campaign, where you can join other agents to fight the outbreak in Manhattan, across a wide range of story missions and open-world activities. The map features dynamic events, loot, and crafting of new weapons and gear. Players also have tons of different modes to play through, including ncursions, Underground, Survival, the Dark Zone, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-acquired-developers-march-of-giants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developers of March of Giants</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">director of Splinter Cell Remake</a> has returned to Ubisoft to finish the game.

            <title><![CDATA[High on Life 2: The Final Preview – IGN First]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-the-final-preview-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1387426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/ign-first-highonlife2-7-handsonpreview-banner-1766006046128.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When I sat down to play High on Life 2 for the first time, I was optimistic but also slightly skeptical. I’m hardly alone when I say that I loved the first one – it was a rare example of a genuinely funny game and it happened to be an excellent first-person shooter to boot. But making sequels to comedies is no sure thing – just look at the long list of great comedy films that got bad follow-ups. How would a video game comedy sequel fare?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the hour of High on Life 2 I played is any indication, it’s got a great chance to be as funny as – and possibly even more fun on the gameplay side than – the 2022 original. In that hour alone, I wandered around a beautiful beachside alien town, met a semi-depressed new gun named Travis and got completely wasted with him, impressed some alien teenagers with my skateboarding skills, circumcised a giant alien phallus with a laser, stole the fedora from the 1996 movie Dunston Checks In, tried (unsuccessfully) to solve a murder mystery, and bounty-hunted a billionaire who, yes, met his demise. Did I laugh along the way? Yup. Is the first-person shooter combat improved from the original? Certainly. Did I appreciate the variety of gameplay within this small slice of the campaign? Most definitely yes. Like I said, I went in optimistic, but when my demo ended I was more excited than ever for High on Life 2’s February 13, 2026 release.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skate or Die</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I began in Pinkline Harbor, a beach town with a bar, a skate shop, a bar and grill overlooking the sea, and more. It didn’t take long for me to find trouble, as a pair of fellow bounty hunters accosted me and eventually recognized me as a mark with a big bounty on my own head. After taking them out, the bottleneck was clear and I was free to explore the harbor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This gave me my first taste of High on Life 2’s new traversal mechanic: skateboarding. I’ve played a lot of first-person shooters in my day, but I’m not sure I’ve ever played an FPS with skateboarding in it until now. And I have to say, I love how developer Squanch Games has implemented it here. It’s basically your run function. When you press the sprint button, your outlaw hero deploys their board and starts riding. You can grind on rails to really get around the open playspaces faster, and you’ve got momentum like an actual skateboard does, too, allowing you to catch air if you’re skating in, say, an empty pool on a cruise ship. I’m really interested to see how the skateboarding gets utilized throughout the campaign; I already saw it incorporated into a basic puzzle in my demo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure I’ve ever played an FPS with skateboarding in it until now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After solving that simple locked-door puzzle with the help of my skateboard, I cruised into Pinkbellies Bar and Grill and met Travis, a down-on-his-luck alien (who happens to be a gun) who’s getting drunk at the bar after a fight with his wife. It’s here we see a welcome tweak to the first High on Life: you now have dialogue choices for each of your gun characters; if you choose one that’s from a different gun than what you’re holding, you’ll put that gun away and take out the one whose response you’ve chosen. This allows for plenty of funny options, and while I wouldn’t say this alone encourages replayability, if you do happen to run through High on Life 2 more than once, at least you can ensure that you won’t hear all of the exact same dialogue.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hold Your Liquor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got to keep Travis happy as you pretend to be his drinking buddy, as he’s got a spare ticket for the cruise ship you need to get aboard, since that’s where your target – the billionaire Larry Pinkstock – is believed to be. And so there’s a literal Happy-O-Meter that you’ll fill by dancing in a DDR-like minigame, playing darts while hammered, and drawing a portrait of Travis. Naturally, this leads to a bar fight and you vomiting and blacking out and waking up on the beach. Did my actions during any part of this gameplay sequence seem to really matter? Not really. But did I laugh throughout it? Absolutely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, getting aboard the ship isn’t as easy as simply walking onto it; you’ll need to fight your way through some more bounty-hunting bad guys. This battle gives you a good sense of how traversal – from the skateboard to using Knifey as a grappling hook – is organically woven into combat. If you keep moving you’ll be tough to bring down, particularly when you mix in frequent use of each gun’s special attack; they’re each on a cooldown, so you can’t spam them. Combat definitely feels more layered in this sequel than it did in the first game. In other words, you’ve got more options at your disposal in any given encounter, and that’s a good thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat definitely feels more layered in this sequel than it did in the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once aboard the ship, called the Pinkline Panacea, you’ll need to give up your guns at the security checkpoint before enjoying the perks of your VIP ticket – which includes the highlight of the evening, a murder mystery party. Thus, getting dressed up for the big event is a must, so Travis buys you both wild, matching Austin Powers-looking purple suits from a vendor who looks suspiciously like an alien version of John Waters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Laser That Wiener</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I needed to get my friends – aka my guns – back, and so Travis and I wandered into Pinkstock’s museum to search for them. We didn’t find them, but we did find the fedora worn by Dunston the orangutan in Dunston Checks In, which Travis instantly became obsessed with. So, how to get it for him without alerting security? Well, as luck would have it, the adjacent museum piece is a giant alien phallus, set up for museum patrons to circumcise using the circumcision laser. I won’t spoil the puzzle solution, but let’s just say that yes, I did get Travis that fedora. And acquiring it was a very funny process.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More exploration of the ship led us to the Lido Deck, where a gang of unruly teens had managed to get their hands on Knifey. And in a clear humorous nod to Tony Hawk, the teens agreed to return Knifey – if I showed off my skateboarding skills by collecting the letters scattered around the deck…that happened to spell out the word “gonads.” L-O-L. And as you can already see, High on Life 2 is chock full of variety, and I haven’t even told you about the best part of my demo yet… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Whodunnit?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After battling some more bounty hunters on the Lido Deck who were looking to cash in on the price on my head, I made my way back to my cabin and passed out before the party. Once we got to the VIP murder mystery bash, I found four strange fellow guests, and soon our mysterious host appeared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I expected a <em>very </em>light bit of clue-gathering in this sequence, and if that’s all it had been, High on Life 2 still would’ve earned points in my book for continuing to mix up the gameplay. However, developer Squanch Games had other ideas. The murder mystery is no joke, both tonally and difficulty-wise. The team clearly took this section very seriously, and as such you’ll need to talk to all four suspects repeatedly, scour the room for both obvious and hidden clues, make notes in your on-screen notepad, and eventually not just accuse one of the four, but have collected enough evidence and made enough connections to establish a motive and credibly pin the crime on one of them. I’m purposely not going to say any more about this because I don’t want to spoil any of it for you, but I’ll admit that while I did end up accusing the correct person, I hadn’t solidly established a motive, and thus, I failed to solve the murder mystery. I can’t wait to play this again in the final version of the game in order to take another crack at it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who’s the Boss?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I escaped the murder mystery via a water slide that took me to the lower deck. This led to another big battle where I got to test out another new weapon in High on Life 2: the Flint Turtles. They’re temporary-use pickups in the practical sense, and in the literal sense, they’re adorable reptiles who happen to breathe fire, making for convenient single-use flamethrowers. One miniboss fight and a few more rounds of regular combat later and I finally found myself at the end of my demo in a proper boss fight against Kreg, the leader of the bounty hunter gang that had been harassing me throughout my demo. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kreg proved to be a pretty traditional first-person shooter boss foe. He had attack patterns to learn and weak moments where I could really let him have it. I wouldn’t say this fight was better than the excellent boss battles in the first High on Life, but it was an engaging enough encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All told, I was pleasantly surprised by my hour with High on Life 2. Not surprised that it was good, to be clear – I expected that – but rather delighted by just how nicely the gameplay has evolved from the first game, and how much smart, funny, and unexpected variety there was throughout the gameplay. I wasn’t simply shooting the entire time. Far from it! If the whole of High on Life 2 matches what my one-hour slice brought to the table, then it’s going to be a very welcome addition to Xbox – including Game Pass on day one – PC, and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-pc-game-of-2025</link>
            <guid>1387420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grab your mouse and get clicking, because it's been a great year for games, and the PC has seen nearly all of them cross its path. The IGN staff has rounded up the best PC gaming had to offer in 2025 and pitted them against each other in a free-for-all Quake match for the crown… okay, actually we just nominated our top five and then voted on a winner, though we'll also be shouting out a few more standouts that are worth highlighting alongside them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, the PC list comes with a few funny caveats alongside its console-based competition – or, more specifically, because of the fact that it's not <em>really</em> trying to fight in that age-old war. PCs have long acted as a bit of a catchall for gaming as a hobby, and that's been more true than ever in recent years as nearly every (non-Nintendo) "exclusive" seems to make its way to Steam at some point. Certain games on this list can feel a little more PC-focused than others, but some of the selections here might look a bit familiar if you've followed out console awards. That's the nature of our multi-platform hobby. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two games worth shouting out that didn't make our best PC shortlist are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> – strategy games have a comfy home here, and while the genre is is a little tougher to penetrate than likes of RPGs and action games, its undeniable that 2025 has been a great year for 4X fans. Similarly, mouse-and-keyboard diehards had plenty to sink their teeth into this year with awesome FPS options like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, all of which are sitting comfortably as nominees for our Best Shooter category. There were also some excellent indie roguelike hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball x Pit</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/megabonk">Megabonk</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> that can feel at home on PC. That's not to mention another great RPG that just got pushed out of the top five here in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, as well as the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, both of which made our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-xbox-game-of-2025">Best Xbox</a> nominations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-1765894953348.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation around the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was almost entirely dominated by difficulty when it first arrived. It's a brutally challenging platformer, often unforgiving but never outright unfair, and one that truly tested those who tried to conquer its seemingly endless map. But to boil Silksong down to <em>only</em> discussions of difficulty does it a disservice. Whether or not that one run back to a boss is too long, or that fake save bench that actually drops you into a pit of poison water is too mean (it's not, it's hilarious), there is <em>so much</em> Silksong does right, or more often brilliantly, that make it a truly stunning achievement overall. Its world is detailed and beautiful, its characters are charming and cleverly written, its music is consistently fantastic, and its branching paths let you explore and grow stronger no matter which direction you go, always giving you options if you hit a physical or metaphorical wall. The story it tells is also touching and nuanced, told through a lead character that has become a standout. Silksong is a game that nails nearly everything it attempts, and a sequel that was absolutely worth the wait.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Blue Prince</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-blue-prince-1765894965856.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to underestimate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>. In fact, it's easy to reach the credits, play deep into its endgame, and <em>still </em>underestimate just how much is hidden in the shifting halls of the roguelike puzzler. A smart blend of genres that come together to make something not quite like anything else we've played before, Blue Prince is one of those singular puzzle games that hooks you hard and then makes you wish you could wipe your mind and play it all over again once you're finally through. Its only frustration comes in the form of its randomness, but even that is woven in masterfully as a beast that can be tamed with skill, knowledge, and plenty of permanent upgrades. It somehow strikes the same tone as games like Myst, but with the enticing "just one more run" of wildly different all-time contenders like Slay The Spire. That's a hard line to walk, but Blue Prince strides along it with grace.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Hades 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-hades-2-1765894985780.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> had the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of an absolute giant. How do you improve on something already so close to perfection? Well, developer Supergiant's strategy was to go bigger bigger bigger. It doesn't revolutionize what made the original Hades so incredible, but it does offer a distinctly different flavor of it, and then stuffs that refreshed package full of so many new areas, enemies, systems, and upgrade options that it more than fulfills the role of a true and proper sequel. Melinoë's journey to kill the titan of time is also a fun twist on a familiar formula, and her moveset and weapon options masterfully shake up the still excellent action without overcomplicating anything – that's why although it didn't win the top spot here, it was crowned our best action game of 2025. And, of course, all of that is complimented by the same gorgeous sense of style and hypnotizing soundtrack that helped the first game leave such a lasting mark.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-1765894998565.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may command the center of the RPG stage in 2025, but overlooking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> dancing right alongside it would be a mistake. This massive medieval adventure could keep you playing well past the 100-hour mark, with tons of stories to unravel and quests to complete. Most notably of all, those tasks come with lots of choices to make that give you a hand in how this tale plays out, as well as the burden of living with the consequences of your actions. We've been waiting a long time already for The Elder Scrolls 6, and it seems like we'll be waiting a long time still, but Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a phenomenal alternative before that day ever comes – and is far from a consolation prize in the meantime, standing as a very impressive RPG that very well could have been claiming the top spot of many a list in a year that wasn't dominated by a certain French game...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765895014393.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn't blame you if you feel like rolling your eyes at the absolute sweep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has rolled out for award ceremonies across both IGN and the games industry as a whole, but becoming so used to it winning everything from best-ofs to costume contests throughout the month of December doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to. This distinctly (perhaps even aggressively) French RPG doesn't really do a ton we haven't seen elsewhere before, transparently owing loads to the plenty of Japanese-made RPGs that so clearly inspired it – but it does bring together loads of familiar pieces and assembles them in a way that feels fresh and new. The exciting and varied action elements of its turn-based combat, the interesting twist on a post-apocalyptic plot, and the powerhouse strength of the ensemble cast fueling the heart of it all. Add to all this that it's come from a brand new developer that clearly understands how to punch above its weight – not to mention it came out of the gate swinging with a PC version that didn't require frantic post-launch patching to be optimized – and it's not hard to understand why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is our winner for Best PC Game of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Got a different pick?

            <p>
Last year, myself, Brendy and Graham  got fearfully excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, a bountiful free 1v1 FPS with map designs calibrated to nostalgiafuck anybody who ever played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> over an LAN or hoarded shareware CDs. Our fever burned all the hotter for knowing that Straftat is the work of them wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, the amazing Brutalist exploration game from 2022.
</p>

Brendy and Graham have now left the Treehouse, alas, so there is nobody here to get excited with me about VHOLUME, a first-person parkour game from one of the Straftat developers. I am sitting alone in my room, sorrowfully punching the air, tears pooling around my ankles and threatening to short-circuit the PC. Just as well it's a single player experience, I guess.

<p>
VHOLUME is the work of Léonard Lemaitre, the aforesaid Straftat dev, plus Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin, who I'm not familiar with. It's being published by IronEqual. The game casts you as Robert, a man galloping through "the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia", ruled by a tyrannical Ministry. He's on a mission to restore his family's revoked ration tickets. Quite what this has to do with parkour remains to be seen. It doesn't look like there are any other humans in the setting.
</p><p>
It's another dystopian Brutalist world of canted slabs, yawning concrete turbines, and slit windows stacked in such a way as to inspire massive trypophobia. In some of the screens, it looks like there's some liveable urban architecture. In others, it looks like a continuation of Straftat's abstract level mash-up ethos, with blocks jutting from mist.</p>
<p>The tech is less 90s than that of Straftat or Babbdi, with softer, diffuse lighting and shadows. I'm not sure which aesthetic I prefer. VHOLUME is a handsome beast, but it's sort of like they rubbed Straftat down with scented oils.
</p>
<p>
Expect "movement-centric gameplay where the player can jump, run, climb and slide with great freedom". True princes of parkour "can exploit momentum, discover shortcuts, and break the labyrinthine design, making each run a test of skill and efficiency as they chase target times."</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, and no trailer, but you can find some gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">Steam page</a>. I imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> fans who can live without the radiance of that game's City of Glass might enjoy this. As will people who relished last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p>

<p>"The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> Rally physics engine continues its evolution with the introduction of all-new Snow Physics and support for studded tyres," Supernova wrote in their <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-ea-0-2-out-now/">announcement</a> of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/514103843981624359?l=english">update 2.0</a>. "Rally drivers must now adapt to a dedicated layer of technical challenge, where control and precision are pushed to their absolute limits under low-grip conditions."</p>
<p>Despite that snow chat, there aren't any full snow stages in the game just yet, with this update instead bringing the Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit - an ice and snow track you can use to get some practice in via AC Rally's time attack and free practice modes. The other addition's a fresh car, the iconic Alpine A110 group 4 coupe, which won the Monte Carlo rally in 1973. It's an utterly beautiful blue machine, and I can't think of many better cars Supernova could have picked to look good as they slide past the snowbanks.</p><p>Anyway, my petrolheading aside, this update also brings a number of handy tweaks. "Based on new field research and validation from professional rally drivers, the gravel and tarmac physics and tyre models have been improved across the board," Supernova wrote. "The force feedback system also sees several fixes and refinements, including better consistency and improved behaviour under braking." The likes of general wheel support and car sound mixing have also gotten attention. Finally, there are 25 new events to give a go.</p>
<p>I'll definitely be making time to give AC Rally another extended go over Christmas, having not currently been back to see how I find it now Supernova have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/803457048228397793?l=english">deployed a fix</a> for the Logitech G29 wheel-specific issues that marred <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-looks-the-part-as-it-heads-into-early-access-but-ive-found-its-driving-a-numb-struggle">my pre-release rallying</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to make sure you have power no matter what, a power station is something you should absolutely invest in. It doesn’t matter if you’re dealing with a storm or another type of emergency, it can help you ensure you’ve got enough power to at least keep food warm, make sure you have a phone to use, or other small electronics that you need to survive.</p>
<p>That’s why the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro is a great choice. Not only is it a compact and versatile power solution that brings reliable energy to almost any situation, but it’s made even more affordable with the recent discount we found at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, it’s just $315, down from its usual price of $530. That’s a discount of $215 and 40% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable power station perfect for emergencies</h2>
<p>This power station has enough capacity to keep things like phones, laptops, lights, small appliances, and even medical devices running when you need them. You get a full suite of outlets, including AC ports for larger electronics and USB ports for smaller gadgets. That means you can charge or power several things at once without needing a bunch of adapters or cords.</p>
<p>Once the power station has been depleted, you can charge it up super quickly. All you have to do is plug it into a wall outlet, use a car charger while you are on the road, or hook it up to compatible solar panels if you are off the grid. Fast recharge means you are not stuck waiting for power to come back after it drains. It also gives you more flexibility to adapt to different situations no matter where you are.</p>



<p>Another practical benefit is the LCD screen on the front that shows how much power you have left. You can check battery levels quickly and easily, so you can plan how long the unit will last for your devices.</p>
<p>The RIVER 2 Pro also feels sturdy and well made. The case is easy to grip and looks like it can stand up to road trips, camping gear, or daily use in a workshop or garage. It does not matter if you are an occasional user or someone who really needs power on the go, the build quality gives you confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro offers a lot of useful features in a compact package. And it’s really a solid deal for anyone looking to add reliable portable power to their gear list. For this price, you’ll get something you can keep and use in an emergency. And if you just need it for an inconvenience, it’s helpful for that as well. Now that it’s time for cold weather that could culminate in emergencies, you might think about grabbing one just in case.</p>

"There will be some more character/social stuff; it's also traditional to add a new farm type," Barone replied. "Lots more, but I don't want to reveal much yet." The upcoming update for the farming/life sim was revealed in August, with Barone noting in September that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-1-7-update-is-going-to-take-a-while-before-it-releases/1100-6534909/">it's going to take "a while."</a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001186320765583409%7Ctwgr%5E582585bacf9f74c2140b1ebd03be3b1f4eee0cb2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Ffirst-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more%2F" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Redfall Review - Half-Staked</p>
      </div>
<p>For Arkane Austin's closure, Smith said the "shock" was that Arkane--as a wider group that also comprised Dishonored studio Arkane Lyon--made well-received and commercially successful games.</p><p>"Creative efforts are unpredictable," he said. "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p><p>Naturally, Smith said he did not agree with the choice to close Arkane Austin, saying he believed "very much" in the studio's future. "We were working on something super cool," he said.</p><p>As for Redfall's struggles, Smith said the game's 1.4 update--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shuttered-studio-arkane-austin-releases-ambitious-final-patch-for-redfall/1100-6523830/" data-ref-id="1100-6523830">released after word came that Arkane Austin would close</a>--delivered a lot of improvements that might have saved the game had they been there at launch.</p><p>"If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/" data-ref-id="1900-6418062">Redfall review</a> scored the game a 4/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Ultimately, Redfall is a game that should not have been released yet."</p><p>Arkane Lyon is now working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-is-bullish-on-microsoft-disney-partnership-for-indiana-jones-and-blade/1100-6527810/" data-ref-id="1100-6527810">new Blade game with Marvel</a>, but it's been some time since we've seen or heard anything about it. </p>

            <p>When Microsoft decided to pull the plug on its Perfect Dark reboot earlier this year, we weren't the only ones to be taken by surprise, with Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan stating she was "absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded".</p>
<p>In fact, Wilton Regan - who has just been announced as the new Lara Croft - said when she was told the project was cancelled, she was "as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">adding she found out at the same time as the rest of us</a>.</p>

<p>"I did not see it coming," Wilton Regan told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/">TheGamer</a>. "We were basically recording bits and bobs throughout '23. We were also doing lots of performance capture for it in '24, and we were even recording more stuff for it in '25. To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe."</p>
<p>According to the actress - who has also had roles in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three - the Perfect Dark reboot had "delivered several milestones that the client was really happy with", though she was unsure how far along The Initiative was in terms of the game's overall development.</p><p>"It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded," Wilton Regan continued. "There was an ecosystem of creativity and collaboration that was in place that we lost overnight. It was really difficult, really difficult for everybody."</p>
<p>For a little while after its cancellation, those close to the project hoped it may survive. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two. Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>. However, it did not.</p>
<p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton Regan said. "Initially, when it made it to the press that Perfect Dark was being defunded, a lot of people reached out for comments about it, both in the media, as well as personally, friends, and professionally, colleagues.</p>
<p>"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><p>Wilton Regan said Perfect Dark's shock cancellation was like nothing she had experienced in her career to date. "And I guess now that I know that it can happen, you become really frightened that the same thing could happen again," she admitted.</p>
<p>While losing the role of Joanna Dark was understandably devastating for Wilton Regan, the actress was able to move her focus to other projects, notably as Lara Croft in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, which she called her "saving grace". But, there are clearly still some scars leftover from Perfect Dark's cancellation, and Wilton Regan admitted she is "frightened about losing Lara" like she lost Joanna.</p>
<p>"I was playing Joanna over here, and I was playing Lara over here, which was wonderful and genuinely one of the most creatively exciting times of my life," Wilton Regan closed. "And I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara." Let's all hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Wilton Regan is taking over the role of Lara Croft from Camilla Luddington, who played the globe-trotting Tomb Raider lead in the rebooted Survivor trilogy. Wilton Regan's first outing as Lara will arrive next year, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. She will then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">reprise the role in 2027's Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, which will take Lara to Northern India.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Luddington <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">shared a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>, writing: "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>
<p>For more from Wilton Regan, she recently spoke to our Ed about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">how AI is impacting the future of voice acting</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/powerwash_simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> racked up some pretty impressive crossover DLC in its time, and its sequel looks like it'll start doing the same next year.</p>
<p>FuturLab has today lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>'s first DLC pack, featuring none other than a handful of locales from the beloved Cartoon Network series, <strong>Adventure Time</strong>. We don't have all that much information on what areas from the Land of Ooo will need a scrubbing, though the developer has confirmed that there will be <em>five</em> of them, each of which can be tackled with up to three pals.</p>
<p>Here's all of the information we have on the DLC so far from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4173830/PowerWash_Simulator_2__Adventure_Time_Pack/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clean Up Distant Lands</strong><br>
Who wants to play video games?! Clean up five new levels from the Land of Ooo. Don’t worry, everything stays right where you left it, but just a little bit cleaner.<br>
<strong>Grab Your Friends Or Adventure Solo<br></strong>Homies help homies, always. So, brave the filth solo, grab your BFF to clean through the campaign together, or grab your 4-man band to shred schmutz in free-play.<br>
<strong>What Time Is It?<br></strong>It’s not quite Adventure Time… yet! UNACCEPTABLE, we know, but we’re still putting the finishing touches (aka: dirt) on everything. Right now, you have only an approximate knowledge of what’s to come, so be sure to Wishlist, join the Discord and follow our socials to stay up to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no precise release date on this one just yet, outside of a vague 'Spring 2026' window, so we'll be keeping an eye out for more details in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion update December 18th patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We’ve fixed an issue which would prevent the “Special Attack Assemble” achievement from triggering in online modes<wbr></li>

<li>We’ve fixed Annihilus moving out of view if his armor is broken by She-Hulk’s Spinning throw<wbr></li>

<li>We’ve fixed missing subtitles for Spider-Man’s first post-Annihilus battle dialogue<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed a blocker that meant the last player couldn’t pick an already-selected Super Hero in Arcade Mode (even if the Doppleganger modifier was turned on)<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve fixed an issue where move lists were displaying incorrectly in multiplayer, if Player One was using a keyboard<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also had a chat with Hela to ensure she doesn’t get bored and go idle if host players leave a multiplayer game during the fight<wbr></li>
<li>We’ve also fixed achievement-related freezes on Windows and Xbox, as well as various crash issues on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2<wbr></li>

</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has denied that it has any kind of partnership with controversial streaming service Kick, following a string of social media posts by the latter that could be construed to mean otherwise.</p><p>Yesterday, the official Kick X account <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001095322265862315/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">posted an image</a> of two people shaking hands, one of whom is holding a package that bears both the Xbox and Kick logos. The image was accompanied by text that simply read "kick (handshake emoji) xbox".</p><p>That image was preceded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2000732922005848225" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an animation</a> that resembles the original Xbox's startup sequence (but with the Kick logo replacing the Xbox branding, of course), and was succeeded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001458279126532297" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a video</a> showing someone unboxing a Kick-themed original Xbox. It's not hard to see how all of this could have been interpreted as an official partnership between the two brands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Kick's recent social media posts seem to strongly imply a partnership with Xbox.</figcaption>

<p>In response to <a href="https://x.com/SnarkingIsLegal/status/2001124399596937292" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an allegation</a> that Microsoft had partnered with Kick, Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/2001399524238020705" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> that it has no partnership with the streaming service, and that a Kick app was instead "independently published" on Xbox's platform. The app is currently being "actively evaluated", and if it's found to breach Xbox's policies, it will be removed.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66044165" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">garnered controversy</a> since its foundation in 2022, partly due to its close links to the gambling industry; while Twitch has banned gambling-related content from its platform, Kick still hosts gambling streams, and its founders, Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani, are also behind crypto casino Stake.</p><p>The platform has also become known for welcoming creators who have been banned or censured by other services, including the likes of&nbsp;Félix "xQc" Lengyel and Kaitlyn "Amouranth" Siragusa, among others.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-new-enterprise-fee-report</link>
            <guid>1387333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has reportedly introduced a new fee that it's asking some of its Enterprise customers to pay, and the "minimum commitment" for which the engine is apparently asking is not small.</p><p>According to <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/unity-risks-fresh-backlash-with-new-fee-demands-this-feels-like-blackmail/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, emails have been sent out by Unity this week targeting "bigger Unity customers" and detailing a new fee that begins at $250,000 and rises to $2 million for the largest proponents.</p><p>The fee, apparently referred to as a "minimum commitment program" by Unity, supposedly "requires that [developers] pay Unity a specified minimum commitment amount at the commencement of each Subscription Year", with the fee based on gross revenue earned by the developer in question.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is just one of the many games that was made in Unity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Mobilegamer.biz's sources, developers with revenue between $25 million and $50 million will need to pay $250,000 to Unity, with the amount rising in direct proportion to revenue. Those who have made over $250 million will need to pay $2 million of that to Unity.</p><p>The engine says that the fees will go towards "your purchase of Unity subscription license and support products", and Mobilegamer.biz's sources claim that developers are threatened with termination if they fail to pay the new fee.</p><p>It probably goes without saying that Unity can ill afford another hit to its public relations right now; the company is arguably still recovering from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2e9dbd5-693e-4701-a45d-1f172ca61b44" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the controversy</a> that was ignited after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d8418f6-6d83-477d-97b7-f18aa50e0a89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the introduction</a> of the so-called "runtime fee" in 2023.</p><p>In that particular case, Unity <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed48a89b-b13e-4d2a-b975-298530ddbc6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reversed its decision</a> fairly swiftly, and then-CEO John Riccitello subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61146301-1035-4016-acad-04d27c632ca1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>. Whether this fee will have a similar effect remains to be seen, but it would seem to be an ill omen for Unity's future direction, at any rate.</p>
<p>Unity hasn't technically announced this new fee in a public-facing capacity, so we'll have to wait and see if it decides to do so and what the reaction will be if and when that happens. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Party Game (Just Dance 2026 Edition) Is 50% Off After 80K+ Sold, Still Arrives Before Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-party-game-just-dance-2026-edition-is-50-off-after-80k-sold-still-arrives-before-christmas-2000654283</link>
            <guid>1387321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="906">With the holiday season right around the corner, many people are preparing to spend long afternoons and evenings gathered with extended family under one roof. While that time together can be meaningful, it can also be challenging to keep everyone entertained for hours on end. After the big meals are finished and the conversations start looping, it helps to have a fun activity ready that can pull everyone together. A lively party game is often the perfect solution, and <strong><em data-start="473" data-end="498">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em></strong> fits that role beautifully. Instead of sitting around scrolling on phones or drifting into awkward debates, family members of all ages can jump up, move their bodies, and share a few laughs. Even better, there’s a timely deal that makes it easier to justify adding it to your holiday lineup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/">Amazon is currently offering the Nintendo Switch version at half off, dropping the price from $50 down to just $25.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="906">A Party Games Everyone Can Enjoy</h2>
<p data-start="908" data-end="1716">One of the biggest draws of <em data-start="936" data-end="961">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> is its impressive music lineup. The <em data-start="998" data-end="1010">Just Dance</em> franchise has been a staple of rhythm and dance gaming since its debut in 2009 during the Wii era, and its longevity speaks to how well the formula still works. Year after year, Ubisoft continues to refresh the experience with new tracks that appeal to a wide audience. This latest entry includes 40 new songs spanning modern pop hits, beloved throwbacks, and internet-fueled favorites. Players can dance along to chart-toppers like “APT.” by ROSÉ &amp; Bruno Mars and “Houdini” by Dua Lipa, as well as classics such as “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic and Madonna’s “Hung Up.” I’m personally most excited by the inclusion of “All Star” by Smash Mouth.</p>
<p>If you already own older versions of the game like <em>Just Dance 2024 Edition </em>or<em> Just Dance 2025 Edition</em>, you don’t have to worry about splitting your content across different menus. All your songs are accessible in one unified platform. Online play is also streamlined, allowing friends to dance together regardless of which yearly edition they own. On top of that, players can subscribe to Just Dance+, which unlocks hundreds of additional tracks and rotating in-game events.</p>



<p>Beyond being a crowd-pleasing party game, <em>Just Dance</em> also doubles as a surprisingly effective fitness tool. For those looking to stay active during the colder months, Workout Mode offers a fun way to build movement into daily routines. Instead of forcing yourself through a repetitive exercise plan, you can burn calories while dancing to music you enjoy. It’s a great option for players who want something more engaging than traditional workouts, whether they’re dancing solo or with others.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the physical version of<em> Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> doesn’t include a game cartridge. Instead, the box contains a download code that you redeem on your Nintendo Switch, after which the game is downloaded directly to your console.&nbsp;If you don’t want to wait and just want the code, you can order the digital version. Though it is still full price at $50, so it might be better to just wait for the empty box to ship.</p>
