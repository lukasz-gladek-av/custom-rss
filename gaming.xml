			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 VS GTA 5 GRAPHICS AND DETAILS COMPARISON" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ih0mVAGQfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

            <p>Physical games remain vital to Nintendo players and developers should not "underestimate" this, an exec at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has said.</p>
<p>CD Projekt is currently getting ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">launch Cyberpunk 2077 on the Switch 2</a> and, unlike many games set to be released on Nintendo's new console, on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch Cyberpunk 2077 will offer a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it.</p>
<p>This puts CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios are instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>

<p>But while there has been a general lean towards digital media over the past few years, CD Projekt says it has used its learnings from releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the original Switch when deciding upon a physical Switch 2 release for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do",   CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>. The exec noted the original Switch's internal storage was "way lower than it is now", and a "game like The Witcher 3 would take up to 80 percent of your internal memory if you don't have an external memory card".</p>
<p>Nintendo players "are quite receptive" to that "plug and play experience", Rosner furthered, and so CDPR knew having a physical cartridge version of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 with no download required was "a goal that we wanted to achieve" from early on.</p>
<p>"Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere," he said, adding he doesn't see "a reality where we're just having all games digital" for a while yet.</p>
<p>"It's especially important for the Nintendo audience," the exec continued. "We maybe could have got away with [a key card], but is there a point? The right thing to do was to have it out on the cartridge with a plug and play experience."</p>
<p>Rosner advises other studios to "not underestimate the physical edition", saying this form of media is "not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the same conversation, Rosner said he believes that we will see "more and more third-party titles on the [Switch 2], which we may not necessarily expect" on the original Switch.</p>
<p>"The previous generation has proven to be so successful, and there [are] so many more players to be reached with that, and I think that the [console's capabilities] will surely allow it," he said.</p>
<p>This seems like a more than reasonable assumption. After all, along with Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Hazelight's Split Fiction will also be a Switch 2 launch title</a>. Other third party titles also confirmed for the platform include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a>, although these won't be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date">available on the console's release</a>.</p>
<p>So, with all that said and done, does it seem likely we will also see a Switch 2 version of The Witcher 3 further down the line? Well, the studio is skirting that question for now and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077">CD Projekt told Eurogamer it is "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with Nintendo goes back to the original Nintendo Switch, where we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We were happy with how that game was received by players so, when we heard about the more powerful Nintendo Switch 2, we immediately thought it would be the perfect platform for Cyberpunk 2077," CD Projekt's gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar told Eurogamer, adding that the studio was "thrilled" to be working with Nintendo again.</p>

The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions." A paid-for expansion, The Edge of Fate will reintroduce us to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, as two characters "step into the spotlight" — new ally Lodi and Warlock Vanguard, Ikora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion will take place on new destination Kepler, described as "inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." Expect new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific abilities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, on July 15, "major core game innovations" will roll out, including revised armor and gear systems "to create richer opportunities for buildcrafting" and a new activity selection screen called the Portal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to easily choose between Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and the newly introduced Solo Ops," Bungie explained. "Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem.

In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">speculation that <u>Starfield</u> would soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5</a> ramped up after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website. The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans were left wondering whether Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game would soon make the jump to PS5.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-starfield-companions-and-crew" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to forget about Starfield given all the attention on Oblivion Remastered, its players are hoping that Microsoft and Bethesda go big on Starfield at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Xbox Games Showcase broadcast</a> on June 8.

            <p>EA won't be raising the price of its games, as the company aims to "deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase".</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson responded to a question on whether it would be following the likes of Nintendo and Xbox in raising the price of its new releases this year.</p>
<p>Wilson noted how the "pricing power" of the business is very different today than a decade ago, with physical releases a "significantly smaller" part of the business and a range of price points from free-to-play to deluxe editions "and beyond".</p>

<p>"At the end of the day whether we're doing something that costs a dollar or we're doing something that costs $10 or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p>
<p>EA CFO Stuart Canfield surmised the company has "no changes in the current strategy at this point".</p>
<p>The company's latest financial report states EA's net bookings for the last financial year totaled $7.355bn. It's essentially flat, with FY24 totalling $7.43bn and FY23 totalling $7.34bn, evidence of the resilience Wilson spoke of.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live services represented 73 percent of total net bookings for the latest financial year. Further, EA's American Football franchise exceeded expectations by reaching over a billion in net bookings, helping EA Sports to its biggest net bookings year ever.</p>
<p>The Sims also had "double digital growth" in the most recent quarter, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">Split Fiction has now sold almost 4m units</a> since its release in March.</p>
<p>In short, the company is doing very well. And with the continued success of its annual sports games and high revenue generated from live service games, there's clearly no need to raise the price of its games just yet.</p>
<p>Speaking to wider economic factors, Wilson said: "Even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macro-economic downturn, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by fans for raising the price of its games with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, as its flagship launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will cost £75/$80. The company has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">stated this is not a new "benchmark"</a> but an example of "variable pricing".</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">raised the price of its Xbox consoles</a>, with some new games rising to $80 by the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sponge away the dross and ephemera of my life and you're left with a series of moments in which I wonder: is <em>now</em> the right time to get into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-heroes">Legend of Heroes</a>? I've been planning to play Nihon Falcom's 17-part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series ever since a respected peer gently suggested that my enthusiasm for Final Fantasy and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> marked me out as a Basic Bitch, and that if I ever want to experience a <em>real</em> role-playing game, I should give LoH a go.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I am held back by a number of things: 1) the Legend Of Heroes games are mega-normous, possibly 2) because they're meandering and overstuffed, for all their quality, and 3) nobody I've spoken to can agree on which I should start with. I did have a breakthrough recently, coming to the conclusion that I should get the ball rolling with The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, the sixth game from 2004 - it's the one I see most often in GOAT threads, and the first in a distinct subseries. But now Nihon Falcom have ruined everything by plotting to remake it. Titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</a>, the remake will launch on 19th September (as revealed in Famitsu, via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19">Gematsu</a>). Here's the most recent trailer.

<p>
If you're familiar with Trails In The Sky, the key differences here are: new HD visuals, new voiceovers, and "the choice of traditional turn-based combat or all-new, real-time action combat", as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/">the Steam page</a>. Great: not only do I now have to decide whether to play the original game or the remake first, I also now have to pick between old and new flavours of battling. Why do you vex me, Nihon Falcom.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I consistently hear about the Trails games is that the NPC and world writing are absolutely excellent: generous to the point of exhausting, with every NPC worth returning to. If you've played it, please do not leave a comment expounding upon these or any other virtues. It will only add to my choice paralysis. I've read that anger freezes into depression if left unexpressed. Is there a point where FOMO metamorphs into a full-on midlife crisis?

It’s a black version of the otherwise almost identical white ROG Ally 2, with a small button in the top-left corner bearing an engraved Xbox logo. That button is blacked out on the regular ROG, though will likely be replaced or removed in its production version.</p><p><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/"><em>91mobiles</em></a> found listings for the ROG Ally 2 at the Indonesian certificate, and <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked"><em>VideoCardz</em></a> linked those to an <a href="https://device.report/fccid/msq-mt7922a12l">FCC listing</a> for the Wi-Fi module included in the two devices, which includes photos of the hardware.

That leaves the hardware as a whole looking thicker than before, but perhaps it’ll be more comfortable to hold.</p><p>With certification already under way, it’s likely that a release is around the corner.

            <p>
One of the programmers behind the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> has praised Rockstar for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gets-a-second-trailer-but-theres-still-no-date-for-a-pc-version">delaying </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s initial release to May next year, observing (not in so many words) that the developers could have rushed out an early release consisting of a city's worth of T-posing NPCs and whitebox freeways, and people would still have paid top dollar for the game. 
</p>

<p>
Posting on social media, DMA Design founder (and former Lemmings developer) Mike Dailly also suggested that the Miami-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s latest trailer is a bump in animation quality over the announcement video from 2023. I know, I know: video game looks better as it gets closer to release - more at eleven. Still, I have a certain amount of nerdy interest in how, exactly, GTA 6's animations may have come along.</p>
<p>Let's rattle through those trailers again. Here's the one from 2023.

Dailly had this to say on <a href="https://x.com/mdf200/status/1731946221030252614">Xitter</a> of the announcement trailer. "Looks pretty, but the animations...bloody hell guys. Can't you animate things properly? No one moves like that!" Ooft, paging the burn ward! Flash forward to this month, and Dailly's open-ended concerns appear to have been addressed by the second trailer, below.

"Now that's more like it," Dailly wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj2dmckgs2v">Bluesky</a> yesterday. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better... Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it."
</p>
<p>
I am not a computer wizard equipped to conjure sweaty screenfuls of buttock from the sexless insides of a PS5 using the power of maths, but I'll be honest, I don't see an enormous gulf between trailers, beyond the differing presentation and music choice.</p>
<p>Well, I think the bit in the first one where Lucia waves her arms around while standing up in the roofless car looks a bit... impressionistic, like she's trying to conduct an invisible orchestra. But come now, Mike, I don't think it's fair to body-shame an ex-con fresh out of jail because she looks a bit unsteady while sticking her arms out of a moving vehicle. She's trying to blow off some steam, Mike! Besides, perhaps there <em>is</em> an invisible orchestra in the game.</p>
<p>Here are some other arbitrary micro-comparisons: Trailer 1 has flappier bottoms. Trailer 2 has more impetuous playful shoving. Trailer 1 has more heartfelt soul brother handshakes. Trailer 2 has... no crocodiles. Perhaps that crocodile walk cycle can serve as a critical yardstick once GTA 6 releases on console next year (PC release date, as ever, to follow). In the meantime, I welcome your mealy-minded feats of frame analysis.

            <p>
Photos of the upcoming Xbox-branded handheld made by Asus have been spilled online.
</p>
<p>
The images show two versions of the Asus ROG Ally 2, with a a regular white-coloured version as well as a black-coloured variant that includes a dedicated Xbox button. 
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, this leak comes direct from the US FCC's official certification of the hardware, and appears to be our first look at Microsoft and Asus' "Project Kennan" handheld plans.

<p>
Microsoft is set to officially reveal Project Kennan in the coming months - the company's annual June showcase seems a fair bet - and detail more about the system. 
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how powerful the hardware's technical specs are, and to what extent it will be able to play the full Xbox back catalogue.

<p>
On the surface, however, the device looks somewhat similar to the Steam Deck and other existing handheld PC hardware. Analogue sticks sit at either side of a screen, with a D-pad on one side and ABXY face buttons on the other. The black-coloured model's small Xbox button can be seen on its upper left side.

<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/xboxs-project-kennan-pc-gaming-handheld-leaks-in-new-photos-alongside-the-rog-ally-2">Windows Central</a> reports that the device is now being tested openly at Microsoft's US headquarters, ahead of its public unveiling. 
</p>
<p>
But with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Xbox prices going up worldwide</a>, the big question is - how much will Project Kennan eventually cost?

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em><br>
<em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration.</em><br>
<em>Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em><br>
<em>- Account suspension</em><br>
<em>- In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em><br>
<em>- No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em><br>
<em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>
<p>This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a>, which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>
<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>
<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>
<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>
<li>Required to comply with COPPA, including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</em></p>
<p>The popular free-to-play action RPG <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being updated today to patch 5.6</a>. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.</p>

            <p>A new video with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi suggests the full <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> remake series is heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At the reveal for Nintendo's new console, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade would be released on Switch 2</a>, though there's no release date just yet. However, that's just the first part of the planned trilogy, with Rebirth (part two) already out on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The latest Creator's Voice video from Nintendo features Hamaguchi expressing his excitement at developing for a Nintendo console. But what's most interesting are his frequent references not just to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, but to the whole series.</p>

<p>Discussing the new console's technical specs, Hamaguchi states he felt "it would have enough power to run the Final Fantasy 7 remake series" he's creating. Later, he notes this is his first time creating a game for a Nintendo system, adding: "And the fact that it happens to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, considering the original game gave me the opportunity to pursue a career in the games industry, makes me feel like it was fate."</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Hamaguchi gives the closest comment yet to confirmation of the full trilogy coming to Switch 2: "And with the release of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series on Switch 2, it would make me very happy if two generations connect and share a bond over the characters."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a console exclusive on PS5, but it would appear a port for the Switch 2 could well be in development. Finally, Queen's Blood on the go!</p>
<p>It begs the question though: what about Xbox? And further: what does this mean for part three? Will that also be a timed console exclusive on PlayStation, or can we expect a simultaneous release on other consoles too?</p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" in 2024 after both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 failed to meet sales expectations</a>.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 is the more popular, could Final Fantasy 16 also be released on Switch 2 in future?</p>
<p>As for part three of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">Yoshinori Kitase confirmed at the start of the year its story has been completed</a>. However, it's still unknown when it will be released - and on which platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> publisher EA has praised the game's "hugely successful launch", as developer Hazelight celebrates another sales milestone.</p>
<p>As part of its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">report for the 2025 fiscal year</a>, EA said Split Fiction was a key part in leading the company to a "strong finish" alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>

<p>"Q4 marked a strong finish to FY25, with broad-based momentum across the portfolio positioning the business for accelerated growth," said EA CFO Stuart Canfield. "As we enter FY26, we remain focused on disciplined execution as we build toward a slate of groundbreaking upcoming releases."</p>
<p>Soon after EA released its report, Hazelight announced Split Fiction has now sold 4m copies since its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>"So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it’s amazing…" the <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">studio wrote on social media</a>. "Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight."</p>
<p>It also made a playful wink wink, nudge nudge remark about "so many hot dogs made", but I won't say any more about that right now... It really is a moment best experienced first hand (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hazelight</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>.</p>
<p>Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>And, it doesn't seem likely Split Fiction will lose any moment any time soon. A film adaptation of Split Fiction is already in the works, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Sydney Sweeney set to both star and produce</a>. The upcoming film is being directed by Jon M Chu, whose previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction will be a Switch 2 launch title</a> when the console releases next month. So, we can pretty much guarantee that the game will sell even more pretty darn soon.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Imagine the most generic video game setting that you can. It’s sci-fi, of course, with an abundance of chrome-plated, neon-soaked, space prisons bursting with grotesque slobbering mutants, vicious cyborgs and pistol-toting, visor-wearing punks. It’s all big swords, big guns, and even bigger biceps. Envisage all of that in your mind and you will be seeing the world of Kiborg.</p>
<p><iframe title="KIBORG - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pPyCAro1gE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kiborg is an old-school third person action brawler, a game ripped straight out of a bygone console era. Though, unlike the early noughties games it mimics, Kiborg exists within the most populous genre of the 2020s, a roguelike. You take on the role of Morgan Lee, a bald, burly, gloriously moustachioed amnesiac who is stuck in a SMASH TV-like game show. You fight your way trough a vast prison, your gory exploits broadcast to the violence loving audience, in an attempt to reach the shuttle on the roof and your freedom.</p>


<p>Of course, this being a roguelite, you’ll die numerous times in the process, starting from the beginning of the game again, but this time you are slightly more powerful thanks to spending your hard-earned collectables on some permanent upgrades.</p>


<p>Borrowing from the classic Arkham Asylum combat style, Kiborg is a surprisingly punishing and gruelling roguelike, thanks to having far too many enemies who will gladly wipe out most of your health bar with just one hit. Matters aren’t helped by an obtuse parrying system, one with input timing that never really clicks. Sometimes you’ll counter like a master, other times you’ll get obliterated, even though you’re convinced you are tapping the right button at the correct time. In the mindless third person punch ‘em ups that Kiborg apes such inconsistencies didn’t matter, but in a roguelite, controller precision is everything, and Kiborg is far too rough around the edges in this regard.</p>
<p>Take dodging, which rarely sends Morgan in the direction you want him to go, resulting in a hefty health bar deduction as the usual punishment, particularly if you’re trying to escape an area attack. Gun play is dodgy too, quick firing often auto-aiming at the wrong target, resulting in a waste of the very limited ammunition you possess. Then there’s the combos, which thanks to the inconsistent input timings usually result in Morgan doing something you didn’t expect, so you just stick to the far more effective three-punch combo and spin kick to see you through.</p>
<p>If the difficulty wasn’t so grindy, these issues could be forgiven. But having to trudge through the cheap first-level boss and repetitive enemy types and samey environments again and again to make any progress soon gets tedious.</p>

<p>Yet, there is some old-school charm to be found here. The cybernetic implants you collect on every run are fun, each one radically changing Morgan’s appearance, bestowing him with a robotic head, a cyber-heart, or blades for hands. You can even summon allies to help to take off some of the pressure – even if your intimidating spiked wheel minion thingy gets stuck on the scenery all the time, the big hammer-totting goon is a lifesaver.&nbsp;Character builds are varied because of this, resulting in some hilariously over-the-top special attacks that resemble something straight out of the WWE.</p>
<p>The game’s reliance on its gunplay in later stages is frustrating, as this is by far the weakest aspect of its gameplay. Shooting rarely satisfies, resulting in a minor health bar reduction on most baddies, rather than sending them flying across across the room in a spray of gore as you would expect from the massive shotgun you are wielding. Bosses are walking difficulty-spikes and eminently frustrating, but levelling up Morgan until he can hack through an army of regular baddies in a visceral ballet of violence is undeniably thrilling.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is when the game is at its best, mindlessly punching your way through a room of foes. If only there was more of that, and less of the lacklustre roguelite elements, then Kiborg could have been a worthy contender for your time. Instead, this is likely only one for the curious.</p>

			<p>A combination of leaks has provided the first look at the Asus ROG Ally 2 and the Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Project Kennan. Indonesian publication 91Mobiles <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a certification for a new ASUS handheld at the local certification company for two different models: the RC73XA and the RC73YA.</p>
<p>With the model numbers, this was subsequently linked <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Twitter user Huang514613</a> to a United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing that included pictures of both models. The white one seems to be the regular Asus ROG Ally 2, while the black one appears to feature an Xbox button and could therefore be the Xbox branded handheld.</p>

<p>The same Twitter user also <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919970354363064533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> some of the specifications from the back labels. The RC73YA should be equipped with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-preps-faster-aerith-plus-soc-higher-clocks-lpddr5x-possibly-for-steam-deck-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's AERITH Plus</a>, a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and up to 20 watts of TDP. The RC73XA, on the other hand, is reportedly more powerful, being equipped with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme, an 8-core CPU, 32GB of RAM, and up to 35 watts of TDP.</p>
<p>There have been rumors that Asus <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had partnered with Microsoft</a> to make an&nbsp;<span>Xbox-branded handheld. Later, Asus teased that they were 'cooking' something new, and the Xbox social channel&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-keenan-teases-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> with a not-at-all-subtle</span>&nbsp;meme hinting that it would be about Xbox.</p>
<p>This portable device made in collaboration with Asus will be just a stepping stone in Microsoft's handheld plans. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> by Windows Central, a proper Microsoft-made Xbox handheld will debut in 2027 alongside the successor to the Xbox Series X, featuring direct-to-cloud connectivity, among other things.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in a talk at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem Jason Ronald <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated </a>that the goal of the future Xbox handheld is to combine the best of the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) ecosystems for an optimal user experience.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/polar-star">Polar Star</a> is, basically, rock paper pistol, but with a few dab-handed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> twists that make it instantly compelling.  You're a saloon dwelling varmint sat at a table with nothing but your six shooter and a glass of whiskey for company, and you're accosted by a chain of ne'er-do-wells. Perhaps there's a bounty on your head. Perhaps it's their whiskey you're drinking. It's not clear, but it seems nefarious. You know what ne'er-do-wells are like.</p>

<p>You have three options: drink, prepare, or shoot. Shoot once successfully - while your opponent is drinking - and you win. But if you shoot and fail, you have to use up your other options before you can shoot again. Prepare counters shoots, and drink counters prepare, preventing your opponent from shooting the next round. But, if your opponent also drinks, <em>you</em> can't shoot next round, and if you both shoot at the same time, you both lose. Or, just you lose really. I assume the game doesn't care.</p>
<p>So, simple enough, but then it throws cards into the mix. One reveals what your opponent is going to do next, one resurrects you both the next time you die, and so on. I had to play the tutorial three times to fully grasp that the game wasn't completely chance-based - it doesn't explain itself perfectly - but I went on a nice journey of realising just how neat Polar Star is during those three attempts. The demo is a bit limited, but it does feature an endless mode with card modifiers unlocked.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is how stylish the game is. Low poly smokiness with neon flourishes and nicotine hues, and some southern-fried electronic OST bangers.

            <p>Last month, Blizzard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-big-collab-is-berserk-yeah-ok-that-ones-pretty-good-i-guess">announced the first of their planned collaboration events</a>/themed cosmetic greed-jamborees for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Kicking things off is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> - Kentaro Miura's dark fantasy manga about a large man swinging a large sword at demons, full of panels that are very good at conveying thrilling duels with a bunch of slash marks and captions that say 'snick' a lot. I'm no superfan, but I do own a few books, and the original anime is one of my favourites - even if its <a href="https://youtu.be/9TRemrRaPjc">brilliant theme song</a> lied to me re: having zero problems in life as long as I'm wearing my glasses.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The cosmetics - four armour sets, a mount, and a pet - are now out, alongside their prices. In brief, buying the whole lot individually (there's no bundle discount or similar available) will set you back 16,500 of Diablo 4's gamerbux, named platinum. To cover that, your best option is the 18,500 platinum bundle. The price? $149.99 US, or £125.99. Cheers <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/diablo-4s-berserk-crossover-dlc-costs-an-insane-usd150">Push Square</a>.</p>
<p>Now, far be it from me to tell you what your money's worth. But (just picking a random example out of the infinite other potential uses for that small fortune) if you popped over to <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/berserk-multi-volume-books">Dark Horse Publishing's website right now</a>, you could pick up the first four deluxe hardbacks of the actual manga for £107. You'd have a few quid leftover too. Perhaps you could buy a very large sippy cup and several gallons of your favourite reading beverage. Yum! Tastes better than a fake fucking horse, anyway. Or, shell out about eight extra quid for volume 5, and you've got the entire Golden Age arc - Guts's origin story, effectively.</p>
<p>Horrific, honestly. Apropos of nothing, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 workers across Activision Blizzard</a> and Xbox early last year. <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/26/video-gamemaker-activision-blizzard-laying-off-400-workers-in-irvine-la/">Activision Blizzard later laid off a further 400</a>. Was this my fault? Please, Blizzard, stop. I'll buy more horses, I promise. I'd ask how the C-suite sleep at night but I already know the answer: without a single dream in their heads that doesn't involve Smaugish wealth hoarding.</p>
<p>If you're new to Berserk, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-guide-to-loving-berserk-the-manga-inspiration-for-the-souls-games">Giada Zavarise's guide to loving it</a>. In other 'everything is Ready Player One now and I want to go take a nap on some train tracks' news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Destiny 2 is doing a Star Wars crossover</a>. Why, if I was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">staffer who got laid off</a> after working hard on establishing the series' expansive lore only for Bungie to squat a fat log on my creative legacy, I'd sure be plum miffed right about now! Sweating, wiping my brow, can't work out whether to press the button that reads 'preserving my sci-fi universe's atmosphere' or the one labelled 'tauntaun reference'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
