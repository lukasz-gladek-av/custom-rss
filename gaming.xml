		<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is a game that stands out for a number of reasons, not least because it shone as one of 2024’s only true exclusive releases for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series consoles</a>. It’s also a spin-off to a beloved film franchise that, instead of being a tie in treads treads its own path and narrative through this character’s ongoing adventures.</p>
<p>It’s an undeniable success, with Troy Baker’s turn as Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones proving to be nothing short of remarkable. The story is classic Indy, with a mysterious set of events putting Dr Jones in the direct path of Adolf Hitler’s obsession with the occult, while menacing German archaeologist, Herr Voss chews up the scenery in vicious style.</p>
<p>It’s a game that could easily drag you in from beginning to end, consuming all of your gaming time for a week, but for whatever reason – eating more than my body weight in mince pies at repeated family gatherings being one of them – I’ve not been able to play huge swathes of the game, instead diving in episodically to beat a puzzle, take a few pictures of historic buildings, or indulge in the excellent cutscenes. I’ve been loving it, and if anything this is how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> makes the most sense, with the game mimicking the beats of the very movie serials that inspired Geroge Lucas to create Indy in the first place.</p>

<p>Serials rose to prominence in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, with movies broken down into weekly episodic releases, tempting audiences to return time and time again to the theatre. In a lot of ways, they paved the way for TV series and episodic content that have come to define the way we consume television.</p>

<p>They were often action-packed, with a binary vision of good and evil, making stars of the stalwart heroes and the helpless maidens that they rescued, and each episode came to a close with a cliffhanger designed to bring you back a week later, the hero dangling from a precipice or seemingly destined to die at the hands of a nefarious villain.</p>
<p>These beats exist within Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and, playing it like a serial, they work incredibly well. An early pause comes beneath the Vatican, trapped in a chamber with two potentially deadly routes to navigate. Rather than continue straight through, this was where I left the game, mulling over the fantastical catacombs hidden beneath Rome, and dwelling on what the possible solutions might be.</p>
<p>By the time I returned, I was thoroughly invested in continuing Dr Jones’ adventure. Arguably, even more so than if I’d just hurtled through it as we’re so often keen to do, and particularly as a games writer who plays things to a deadline.</p>

<p>Even just the opening tutorial, a lavishly recreated rendition of the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark, is a perfect serial episode, introducing us to our hero and, in the film, our antagonist. It’s packed full of action and drama, lasts fifteen minutes, and in the movie it ends with Jones’ dramatic escape via seaplane, setting us up for the further adventures we’re about to take part in.</p>
<p>Lucas’ obsession with serial movies stemmed from his childhood, where Saturday-morning matinees revisited the format that was already starting to dwindle in popularity thanks to the rise of television. Here, serials like Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and Zorro cemented his love for swashbuckling heroes, and of science fiction, which he famously had some small success with as well.</p>
<p>If anything, episodic content is the perfect delivery format. The first instances of it can be traced back to the serialised fiction that authors like Charles Dickens and F. Scott Fitzgerald made their name with, releasing a steady stream of serialised chapters in the newspapers of the day. Novellas like A Christmas Carol built their audience organically, gaining popularity, notoriety and success long before water coolers had been invented to talk about them over.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this worked, and continues to work, in terms of distributing content to the masses, but in the case of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle it’s because it gives you time to think. It gives you time to mull over the things you’ve seen, the places you’ve visited, and roll them over in your mind, picking away at the layers of art and storytelling that MachineGames have crafted.</p>

<p>Games have adopted more episodic formats in a variety of ways, though it’s come at a price. Live service games are the most significant example running through the industry right now, their constant need for new activities, more battle passes, higher player engagement metrics leading to a massive churn of creative effort that all too often feels doomed to failure. A better parallel would be the episodic narrative adventures of Telltale Games, though they famously struggled to meet production deadlines, the gaps between episodes being too long and interest waning – thankfully their most recent effort, The Expanse, from the reborn studio had a faster cadence.</p>
<p>And on a more simplistic level, we often see games designed with a more bitesized narrative approach in mind. That’s especially true of games for handhelds like Nintendo Switch or even PC handhelds like Steam Deck, where games that let you pick up and play for 10-20 minutes at a time can mesh better with the free time windows we have for gaming.</p>
<p>While Indiana Jones and The Great Circle doesn’t explicitly stop and start, nor pushes you to do so, the beats of serialised fiction and cinema run through it. I urge you, perhaps for a second playthrough, or if you’re waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">the game’s eventual release on PS5</a>, consider playing it like the serials that inspired the character. Step away at the cliffhanger, leave Indy dangling from a zeppelin, because, just like the artefacts he cherishes, the passage of time changes things, adding value where there wasn’t any before.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wartorn-is-a-fantasy-real-time-tactics-game-with-roguelite-elements-set-for-spring-debut-in-early-access.1083771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wartorn-is-a-fantasy-real-time-tactics-game-with-roguelite-elements-set-for-spring-debut-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Dallas-based game developer Stray Kite Studios announced Wartorn, an upcoming real-time tactics game with roguelite elements. It will be set in a fantasy realm devastated by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds and follows two elven sisters as they fight to survive and reunite with their family. Stray Kite promises tough decisions for players, such as deciding who gets fed or which lives can be saved, all while confronting the eternal moral dilemmas of violence and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Paul Hellquist (BioShock, Borderlands 2), Creative Director and Co-founder of Stray Kite Studios, said:</p>
<p><em>Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness. We’ve poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us.</em></p>
<p>Shovaen Patel (Orcs Must Die!), Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Stray Kite Studios, added:</p>
<p><em>Our vision for Wartorn is a game that seamlessly blends artistic expression, tactical depth, and emotional resonance. We want players to feel like every choice matters, both on the battlefield and in the story.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Wartorn - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, we're promised a dynamic combat system that emphasizes taking advantage of elemental forces like fire, water, and lightning. Players may ignite tar to engulf enemies, amplify electric shocks with water, or douse flames if it suits them. The environments are also destructible, ensuring additional layers of depth and unpredictability to the encounters. The roguelite-inspired progression will reward persevering players by offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that can be carried to the next run. There's also a slow-time feature that lets players pause combat and issue precise commands, adapting gameplay to suit their pace.</p>
<p>Visually, Wartorn adopts a peculiar painterly aesthetic that might not be to everyone's liking. We'll see what the reaction is from the public. The game is set to debut this Spring in early access via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/dollars-for-dlss-is-nvidias-rtx-50-series-gpu-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dollars-for-dlss-is-nvidias-rtx-50-series-gpu-worth-it.1083768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/dollars-for-dlss-is-nvidias-rtx-50-series-gpu-worth-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the unveiling of the RTX 50 series of graphics cards, Nvidia has effectively crowned itself the king of high-end gaming GPU designers. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82RwXqZHY8" rel="nofollow">Nvidia's CES 2025 keynote, CEO Jensen Huang showcased what he believes the future will look like</a>, starting with the implementation of "AI" into Nvidia's next generation of GPUs. Indeed, "AI" seemed to the the word of the day for Nvidia as most of their keynote was centered around autonomous vehicles and robots, concepts that were once limited to the realm of science fiction.</p>

<p>If Nvidia were to be believed, true artificial intelligence is just around the corner, waiting for the chance to kill all the humans and take our jobs. For now, "AI" will have to be content with rendering more reflective puddles in games via DLSS.</p>

<p>DLSS itself is basically a fancy term for "rendering technologies that uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and improve image quality" and has been supported by Nvidia GPUs since the RTX 20 series. The RTX 50 series will be utilizing DLSS 4, which is "backed by an Nvidia AI supercomputer in the cloud constantly improving your PC's gaming capabilities."</p>

<p>Putting aside the marketing buzzword salad, Nvidia's RTX 50 series seems like a great leap forward for GPUs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" rel="nofollow">Digital Foundry's demonstration of the RTX 5080</a> appears to echo this sentiment, showing that at the absolute highest level the RTX 50 series can make a game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run like it was originally advertised.</p>

<p>Therein lies the conundrum with the RTX 50 series though. With a price tag ranging from between $550 to $2,000, this next generation of GPU is likely going to be wildly out of reach for the average gamer, bringing up the question, "Who is this for?"</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: The Best GPUs For A Game That Doesn't Yet Exist</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-specs.jpg?itok=oHsOx03A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-specs.jpg?itok=_uUWFO_H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bigger number equals gooder</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" rel="nofollow">according to Steam's own end-user survey</a>, only about 20% of the participants are using RTX 40 series GPUs. Most are sticking to the 30 series and below, and it's reasonable to assume that lower end hardware is far more prevalent as casual gamers are probably not shelling out hundreds of dollars for a newer GPU. For that matter, it's doubtful that casual players would be particularly inclined to take part in the survey to begin with.</p>

<p>If anything, it seems irresponsible to recommend the RTX 50 series to most people because it is complete overkill for the vast majority of games. Perhaps in 10 years we'll get games that "need" DLSS, but the RTX 20 series and above supports DLSS anyways, so it's kind of a moot point.</p>

<p>A look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers" rel="nofollow">Steam's top sellers list</a> reinforces this notion as it shows that the most popular games are not exactly hardware intensive. As an example, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow">Helldivers 2</a> </em>are both perfectly content with Nvidia's RTX 20 series GPUs. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> recommends a GTX 1070. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow">Balatro</a> </em>can be run on a toaster.</p>

<p>As you go down the list, <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> status as an outlier becomes more and more apparent, making it simultaneously the best and worst game to use to show what a graphics card is capable of. The average game simply isn't going to need state-of-the-art GPUs to look good, doubly so if it's a decade-old game like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: Do You Guys Not Have Phones?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zzz-ps5-ray-tracing.jpg?itok=A9nL8J-G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zzz-ps5-ray-tracing.jpg?itok=Srx7lEJx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pour one out for all the janitors who died to make sure that golden toilet remained reflective after the apocalypse</figcaption></figure><p>Things look even more dire when you throw in the fact that the mobile gaming market is actually the same size as the combined PC and console gaming market. According to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2023-pc-games-revenue-increase-newzoo/" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278181/global-gaming-market-revenue-device/" rel="nofollow">Statista</a>, the PC gaming market is the smallest of the three by far, making up less than 25% of the overall gaming market revenue in 2023 and 2024. If Nvidia's RTX 50 series is overkill for "normal" PC games, then using it for PC ports of mobile games would be akin to strapping a jet engine onto a bicycle to make the bike go faster.</p>

<p>As an example, Hoyoverse recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqFkJqHj5U" rel="nofollow">added ray tracing to <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> exclusively to the PS5</a>. It's an improvement to be sure, but you kind of have to know what to look for to notice it, and most people probably aren't going to notice it when in combat. Besides, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow">ZZZ's</a> </em>good looks hinges more on its art style than any particular graphical setting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Nvidia's marketing department, they want you to associate ray tracing exclusively with their RTX GPUs. Yet if it's not noticeable in normal gameplay, or if enabling it causes performance issues, then you're not exactly losing out by buying an equally priced console that can also run ray tracing.</p>

<p>This brings up another issue with such blisteringly high-end GPUs as the Nvidia RTX 50 series. Game developers themselves should and will rightfully target the lowest practical common denominator when it comes to hardware. Otherwise it becomes a never-ending arms race where developers would have to spend more resources for better graphics that only an increasingly smaller percentage of the audience will enjoy.</p>

<p>You can see this play out in real time when it comes to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow">Skyrim</a> </em>on the PC. It's generally a good idea to download some enhanced texture mods for <em>Skyrim </em>so that the game looks somewhat up to date, but it has to be done in moderation. After all, there's no point in downloading a 4K texture pack if it causes you to drop to 10 FPS every time you look at a cloud.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: The Power of Marketing, Brand Recognition, and Hopes and Dreams</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-rtx.jpg?itok=w67qLJcm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-rtx.jpg?itok=b1YrKoRc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"RTX on!" cried the magician, and thus the game became playable</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, DLSS and RTX aren't magic, contrary to what Nvidia wants you to believe. Old games aren't going to look like modern games at the press of a button because no GPU in the existence is going to change a game's texture files. A human being has to manually make new textures then apply those textures to the game, a fact that is always conveniently left out of the "RTX On" marketing materials.</p>

<p>That being said, while Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs are complete overkill now, who knows what the future of gaming might look like in 10 or 20 years. It wasn't that long ago that 30 FPS was the norm. Nowadays if a modern game is hitting 30 FPS, people act like the game should go straight to the dumpster.</p>

<p>Ray tracing itself certainly isn't going anywhere. It's another tool for developers to use, if they feel that it is necessary to use it. A painter doesn't need to use every brush available to them for the brushes to be imbued with value.</p>

<p>The future of "AI" assisted rendering is less clear. The use of "AI" in creative fields rightfully leaves a bad taste in people's mouths, to say nothing of practical performance.<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> might look fine while walking around at a leisurely pace, but at the end of the day if the game starts stuttering when the shooting starts and you have particles and visual effects flying everywhere, people will bump down their graphics settings.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: Who's the Real Customer?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-ces-keynote-ai_0.jpg?itok=EtutvtD1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-ces-keynote-ai_0.jpg?itok=V45imSpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>200,000 units are ready, with a million more well on the way</figcaption></figure><p>Make no mistake, Nvidia's RTX 50 series GPU look like they're great pieces of hardware. Upgrading to a RTX 5070 doesn't seem that unreasonable if (and only if) you're several generations behind or you don't particularly care about what the GPU is actually doing under the hood. At the same time, one should keep in mind that the RTX 50 series is essentially a solution looking for a problem to solve as of now, especially when there's no shortage of alternatives.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is that Nvidia wasn't necessarily marketing the RTX 50 series to the average gamer. Like it or not, Nvidia is setting their sights on something bigger than the gaming industry and the proof is in their own CES keynote.</p>

<p>Besides, who said that Nvidia can only sell GPUs to gamers? Hollywood, NASA, the United States Department of Defense, there's a long list of potential customers with pockets far deeper than those of gamers. As far as their shareholders are likely concerned, Nvidia doesn't even need to sell a single 50 series GPU so long as the line on Wall Street keeps going up. That's the real audience for Nvidia's RTX 50 series, and the concerns of your average gamer are barely an afterthought by comparison.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals devs have warned keyboard and mouse adapter users that they will be banned from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on their website, Marvel Rivals devs addressed the community’s queries about keyboard and mouse adapters. They said they would “relentlessly” battle cheating and call on the community to help maintain a positive gaming atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, keyboard and mouse adapters allow players to mimic controller inputs while using a keyboard and mouse. This behaviour gives cheaters an unfair competitive advantage over players using controllers, as the cheater also benefits from the aim-assist features for the console version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals devs have also released a list of keyboard and mouse adapters, including the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series. They added that any other device that emulates controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse would also be considered an adapter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To combat keyboard and mouse adapter users on Marvel Rivals, the devs have created a “strong detection tool” that, along with their “watchful human eyes, accurately identifies those using keyboard and mouse adapters. They will take steps “to vanquish this nefarious behaviour”, regardless of whether you’re on a PC or a console. Players who use these adapters to cheat could be subjected to temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spiderman-suit-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Spider-Man suits</a> is coming to Marvel Rivals later this month. Also, the game director recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their plans for esports</a>.

<p>In a new statement, the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 developers revealed that they are already looking for the next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the statement about the new Warhammer game comes from their latest <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial results</a>. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Roundtree first acknowledged the success of Space Marine 2, stating that they “recognise the success of these recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games”. Roundtree added that they are clearly “looking for the next one” and are remaining “cautious when forecasting royalty income”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about Space Marine 2’s success, the licensing revenue section of the financial statement revealed that earned income was £26.1 million (approximately USD 32 million), and the increase was “mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. 98% of the total licensing revenue for Games Workshop was contributed by PC and Console game, which was also thanks to Space Marine 2’s release on the platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of a new Warhammer Space Marine 2 game, the game director had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-devs-already-have-ideas-for-a-major-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously stated</a> they had already “proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel”.

<p>Treyarch is shocking everyone in Season 2 by adding The Tomb Black Ops 6 Zombies map. It takes BLOPS 6 up to four Zombies maps, and The Tomb’s release date promises new weapons, Easter Eggs, and much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> isn’t standing around on undead ceremony. Developer Treyarch is making up for disappointing years between Black Ops Cold War and BLOPS 6 by announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-revealed-launches-january-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Zombies map</a>—already the fourth, only three months removed from launch. It is set to sit alongside Liberty Falls, Terminus, and Citadelle des Morts, and give you a selection headache.</p>



<p>More content isn’t a bad thing by any means! It’s even more exciting as Treyarch has hinted at big new incomings from Easter Eggs to a legendary weapon making a comeback.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tomb-zombies-map-release-date-in-black-ops-6">The Tomb Zombies Map Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of room to move and die. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Tomb’s release date is January 28—alongside Black Ops 6 Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>Season 1 Reloaded has been fun, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> is shaping up to be a good one. The Tomb is a day-one drop, and you can tell Treyarch is already excited about it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD Zombies blog</a> about Day 115, the team said, “We’ve crafted The Tomb to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls (by far our most-played Zombies map in recent years!), featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-new-easter-eggs-for-the-tomb-zombies-in-black-ops-6">New Easter Eggs For The Tomb Zombies in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A whole new world to explore. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Treyarch has said it’s “delivering plenty of side Easter Eggs” in Black Ops 6 Zombies’ The Tomb map.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen music Easter Eggs for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a>. Each map has featured a plethora of smaller Easter Eggs to go alongside Main Quest objectives too. Even though we don’t know any of the new Easter Eggs, you can likely expect another triple-set of headphones to find, hidden armaments and goodies, and a fully fledged story Easter Egg to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-wonder-weapon-remake-for-the-tomb-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Wonder Weapon Remake for The Tomb in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p><strong>A “reimagined Wonder Weapon” is being teased for The Tomb in Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>The Tomb currently has four <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a> to use: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>, Thrustodyne M23 (AKA Jet Gun), DRI-11 Beamsmasher, and Bastard Swords. A returning weapon from Treyarch’s past narrows it down, but it could still be one of many Wonder Weapons: The DIE Shockwave from Black Ops Cold War, the Void Bow from Black Ops 3, or Alistair’s Annihilator from Black Ops 4.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed it’s a good one I can use to relive nostalgia and turn Zombies into inedible soup.</p>



<h2 id="h-iconic-weapon-returns-in-black-ops-6-the-tomb-map">Iconic Weapon Returns in Black Ops 6 The Tomb Map</h2>



<p><strong>Another promised Black Ops 6 surprise is “one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride” in The Tomb Zombies map.</strong></p>



<p>I don’t know if this ties into one of Season 2’s new guns in general. Either way, it could be an MP-40, PPSH, or M1927 Thompson—all speculation. Treyarch knows how to keep the community entertained and bring back fan-favorite gear. Here’s hoping the announcement lives up to the hype.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you shocked to see The Tomb announced so soon after Citadelle des Morts? How many more Zombies maps do you think Treyarch adds before all is said and done in Black Ops 6 Zombies?</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has discussed why the company's PS Vita handheld didn't sell well, stating Sony didn't have the resources to split between two platforms but originally it had similar capabilities to Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<p>Since its release in 2011, the Vita handheld is estimated to have sold 10-15m units - that's far less than the 80m of its predecessor, the PSP, and less than either the Wii U or the GameCube.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Yoshida suggested why he felt Vita sales under-performed.</p>

<p>"There are multiple reasons why Vita didn't work," he said. "It worked in a way that people loved playing games, especially indie games, on PS Vita. It was lovely hardware."</p>
<p>"Several technical choices we as a company made weren't really good ones," he continued. "One of which was the proprietary memory cards. That was a mistake, people had to spend more money to get the memory cards."</p>
<p>Further, he admitted the back touch "was not necessary". "Sometimes the team made amazing prototypes that felt so good and that misled everyone involved," he said, noting it added cost to the hardware. Similarly the OLED screen increased the production cost of each unit.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Vita dev kit had a video output to allow the handheld to connect to screens, but this was removed for the consumer release.</p>
<p>"It was really a bad idea," Yoshida joked, in a nod to the Switch's capabilities. "The development team removed that feature just to save a few cents of cost."</p>
<p>Yoshida then concluded: "I think the biggest reason Vita didn't do as well as we had hoped was that we had to spread all of our efforts/resources into two different platforms. And we didn't have that resource."</p>
<p>He added Sony didn't have a big enough talent pool across its studios to support both its home consoles (PS3 and PS4) as well as the handheld Vita. And as the consoles were more popular, they were prioritised.</p>
<p>This, Yoshida believes, is why Nintendo has been successful, as the rival company has pooled its resources into a single platform with dual capabilities. He even joked the Switch is the Vita 2.</p>
<p>Still, PlayStation's legacy, said Yoshida, is providing cutting edge technology at affordable prices, so there was never a discussion of combining efforts into a single piece of hardware as Nintendo did.</p>

<p>In the same interview, Yoshida also touched on Sony's live-service game aspirations and said he likely would've resisted the move towards live-service games had he been in Hermen Hulst's position as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>"For me, I was managing this annual budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make," said Yoshida. "If the company was considering [a focus on live-service games], it probably didn't make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into these service games.</p><p>"However, what they did after I moved on and Hermen [Hulst] took over is Sony added a lot more resources. I don't think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. They said 'these games are great, just continue doing that, and we'll give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it'."</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm sure they knew it's risky. The chance of a game being successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that’s the way they did it. In my mind, that’s great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p>
<p>"I'm lucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> did so well!" he joked, adding: "You cannot plan for success in this industry, that's the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end.</p>
<p>"If I was in the position of Hermen, probably I would've tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party, because they knew I wouldn't do it!"</p>

The Switch eShop is slow, outdated, stuffed with shovelware and needs a drastic overhaul in time for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. But if you don't want to wait, there's good news today! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal</a>? What Switch 2 reveal. No, we're talking about the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/eshop">Better eShop</a>, a fan-made project built by website Nintendo Life.
</p>
<p>
This browser-based eShop offers a super-quick interface that plugs into Nintendo's store back-end. It's a much faster way to browse, filters out the hentai, and allows users to still buy games directly from Nintendo.

<p>
Several fan-requested eShop features have been built in as standard, including the ability to read or submit user reviews, and create customisable game search filters. 
</p>
<p>
Filters enabled by default mean you won't see 6247 games that have already been selected as "low quality, low effort or other kinds of spam", five titles listed as "asset flips" and 156 titles "based around hentai".
</p>
<p>
Other cool features include a dark mode, and the ability to toggle on the iconic Wii Shop Channel music. It truly is update day!
</p>
<p>
Upcoming features include Wishlist functionality, screenshots, additional regions (Better eShop currently supports the UK, US and EU) and the ability to mute specific game publishers.
</p>
<p>
"Better eShop was built in less than a week," the site states. "It's quite possible that Nintendo will start blocking us from gathering the data - but until then, we will continue to build and improve the Better eShop."

			<p>Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida was featured in a lengthy video chat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Greg Miller of Kinda Funny Games</a>. Yoshida worked for over thirty years at Sony's PlayStation division, holding positions such as Vice President of Sony Computer Entertainment America, President of Sony Worldwide Studios, and later Head of the Independent Developer Initiative.</p>
<p>His tenure <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially ended yesterday</a> and that's also when the interview went live, diving into the executive's whole career. However, the most interesting part was discussing <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shuhei-yoshida-replaced-hermen-hulst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his replacement with Herman Hulst</a> as the head of the internal first-party studio organization. Shortly afterward, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed heavily into live service games</a> after many successful single player releases.</p>
<p>When asked if the new business strategy made sense to him, Yoshida replied that the resources were additive rather than replacing investments in single player. However, he also admitted he might have resisted that change in direction, and jokingly added that may have been why he was replaced.</p>
<p><em>I was managing this annual budget and was responsible to allocate resources to what kind of games to make. If the company was considering that way, it probably wouldn't have made sense to stop making another God of War or whatever, like a great single player game, and put all the money into these service games. However, what they did after I moved on and Herman Hulst took over is that they added a lot more resources. I don't think they told him to stop making these single player games. They said, oh yeah, these games are great. Continue doing that, and we give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I'm sure they knew it was risky and that the chance of a successful game in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company knowing that risk gave Herman the resources and the chance to try it. I think that's the way they did it, so in my mind I was, oh wow, that's great and hopefully some games will become successful. Luckily, Helldivers 2 did so well. No one would have expected it. You cannot plan a success in this industry, that's the most fun part</em>.</p>
<p><em>I thought if I was in the position of Herman, I would have tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me (laughs).</em></p>
<p>It was definitely a risky move for Sony with more than a few missteps, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Online</a> (canceled after Naughty Dog decided it wouldn't want to become a live service studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a> (shut down just a few days after launch with the subsequent closure of the studio). As Yoshida said, luckily there was one success, albeit the least anticipated among the bunch, with Arrowhead's Helldivers 2, which became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-selling PlayStation title ever</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least another major tidbit that's worth reporting from the interview: the executive's take on the whole Bloodborne situation. Fans have been clamoring to get a sequel or at least a remaster for years, but Sony and FromSoftware appear deaf to those cries. Here's what Yoshida believes is the main obstacle:</p>
<p><em>I have only my personal theory on that situation. I left first party, so I don't know what's going on but my theory is... I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, if Miyazaki is busy with an Elden Ring sequel, he certainly doesn't have time to work on Bloodborne 2. However, Sony has recently become the largest shareholder of FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Corporation. They might have more sway in choosing his next big project.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-expected-to-announce-a-new-game-this-year-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1083729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-new-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios is seemingly gearing up to announce a new Halo game this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/524254/article/halo-will-have-a-new-game-announcement-this-year-says-industry-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1879364933630251302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a> recently spoke about the imminent announcement of an upcoming Halo game. His tweet revealed that the studio has been playtesting future games for the franchise “on a weekly basis”. Rebs Gaming added, “Since they are this far in development, I expect at least one new Halo game announcement this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details about this unannounced Halo game come from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvbaB-n8cro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> video Rebs Gaming posted earlier this week, in which he discussed the new Halo Studios Playtest Lab. This new initiative was revealed through a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xbox_how-do-you-create-the-best-possible-game-activity-7282199996127453185-lYFF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post about a “centralised testing space” that can host staff from different departments so they can playtest games together, share ideas, and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebs Gaming also mentioned another hint about the unannounced Halo game in the same post. The Support, Safety, and Playtest Manager, Susan Bunch, stated that the teams have hosted “a playtest session for the artists and designers to come in and play similar maps in production.” Based on this, the insider speculates that we might receive a reveal pretty soon if maps for the upcoming Halo title are already in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, last month’s massive Halo leak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed dev builds, unreleased content, and more details</a>. Also, OpTic Gaming has assembled a Halo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“super squad” for 2025</a>. What are your thoughts on a new Halo game being announced this year?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The recent deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> details will have left Nintendo "really mad" and prompted time-consuming investigations into where information has leaked from.

That's according to former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, who worked at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> for more than a decade and experienced the company's processes when leaks erupted previously.
</p>
<p>
"This really does have a disruptive impact in what the company's trying to do now, which is to announce and launch a new console - which is hard enough as it is," Yang said on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRh5csh7mI&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta</a> podcast.

<p>
"[Nintendo]'s been disrupted daily, for months, with these leaks, and I'm 100 percent sure they are really mad, to the most severe level. We joke around but... they are very, very, very upset by this."
</p>
<p>
While leaks of information from Nintendo's manufacturing supply chain - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance">such as the Switch 2 motherboard</a> - may be dealt with overseas, the duo discussed information they felt may have trickled out from within Nintendo itself, from the team working on the Switch 2 launch. And when this sort of leak happens, Nintendo always investigates internally.
</p>
<p>
"They do have very good people that investigate these things," Ellis said. "They will eventually get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and it takes a lot of just talking to everybody involved. 
</p>
<p>
"This is hard work, this is a lot of work and the people working on this - and it's not the whole company, it's a small group of people, at this point, who are allowed to know this information - need to focus all of their efforts onto [Switch 2].
</p><p>
"But now... half of their day is going to be eaten up by [questions like] 'I have to talk to you about every step you have taken at this point, who have you talked to, where do you think this could have happened?' And, quite frankly, that's time they don't have."
</p>
<p>
Yang said the pair had been through similar processes during their time at the company, and that teams "basically have another full-time job of being part of the investigation into these leaks". 
</p>
<p>
"It's extremely disruptive, it's a high-stress situation as well because you really feel like you're in the hot seat," Yang concluded.
</p>
<p>
Leaks also limit Nintendo's desire to grow the teams working on under-wraps products, Ellis added, so as to avoid leaks spreading further. This then meant more work, as product launches neared, on a smaller circle of people.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 has been widely-tipped for an imminent reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">reports the console could be unveiled later today</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The expectation is that Nintendo will first show off its long-awaited Switch 2 successor via a brief introductory video focused on the console hardware itself, before a longer look at a later date showcasing Switch 2 games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-2-monster-hunter-wilds/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems insane to me that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is sitting second in our Most Wanted rundown. Not because it’s going to be bad – I’m fairly certain it will be the best Monster Hunter game since the last one – but because for years and years, Monster Hunter was this weird, niche co-op series that was huge in Japan and played by a minimal number of weirdos (like me) everywhere else. Monster Hunter is now Capcom’s biggest franchise, and it’s fair to say that the hype surrounding Monster Hunter Wilds is so big, it probably had something to do with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows moving its release date back yet again</a>. That’s right — Assassin’s Creed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 5th Trailer | The Black Flame" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahy0AO8WwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was an epic sojourn back into Nintendo-centric Monster Hunter games, it was technically limited by arriving natively for the Nintendo Switch. Monster Hunter Wilds though is fundamentally a direct successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-world-iceborne">Monster Hunter World</a> – an incredible, era-defining action RPG that I awarded a rare <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review/">10/10 to back in the day</a>. Add in the benefit of this console generation, with the game set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC all at once, and we’re already lined up for what will be the most technically advanced Monster Hunter ever.</p>


<p>That’s not to say that some of the advancements from Monster Hunter Rise have been forgotten. While we can bid farewell to the flashy Wirebug moves – I don’t know how long it’s going to take me not to try and airdash out of trouble in Monster Hunter Wilds – we are getting an all-new mount to speed us around the open world of Wilds. This time out, rather than those good-boy Palamutes, we’re all going to be riding massive feathered creatures known as Seikrets, who, alongside running really fast, can also glide slowly down from great heights.</p>


<p>It feels as though they’re going to help open up the world, which, rather than being broken down into separate stages, will have different hunting areas to explore. It’s an expansion of the idea we saw in the Guiding Lands of Monster Hunter World’s endgame, where the traditional different landscapes of Monster Hunter were all mashed together, though here in Wilds it’s going to be on a scale the series has never seen before. The dev team aren’t totally labelling it as an ‘open-world’ but equally, they’re not shying away from that tag either. You can expect it to be big.</p>
<p>It needs to be big too, when it’s going to be stuffed with huge monsters for you to take down. If you’ve never played a Monster Hunter game, the loop goes like this: find your target monster, attack them, chase them down, try not to die, capture or kill them, carve off pieces from the carcass, use those pieces to make better weapons and armour, find a bigger monster, repeat. Any story the series has ever had generally stands as an excuse for you to do this over and over again, and, as someone who’s been doing it for twenty years, it’s a loop that doesn’t get old.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will also continue the series tradition of being better with friends, and you can form a party with three other Hunters to take down Monsters in an even more efficient way. Then again, they scale in difficulty and health with more Hunters, so you might just as easily be making things more difficult. There’s nothing better though than working together to bring a monster to its knees, coordinating attacks, focussing on specific limbs or wounds, or laying traps for you all to lead it into. For the first time in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds is going to be cross-play, meaning you can hook up with fellow Hunters across whatever platform they’re playing on. This alone is an epic improvement. If only we could get cross-save too, and then I’d be utterly content.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to be one of the biggest games of the year, and it’s also nearly within reach as it’s set to launch on 28th February for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

A remaster (Sony loves a remaster)? A sequel? A next-gen update? Fans of FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece have begged for more ever since the game launched to critical and commercial acclaim a decade ago. So, what gives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from the reveal of his first voice acting gig following his exit from Sony, PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory. And we must be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Kinda Funny Games</a> he stressed is not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack Shuhei’s comment here. Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">it’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, then 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> for Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Shuhei is touching on here is a potential desire from Miyazaki to do something with Bloodborne, but he doesn’t want anyone else to do it. And Sony, Shuhei suggests, respects that wish, despite owning the intellectual property. Certainly Miyazaki has earned that respect and the ability to pick and choose his projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Sony, some Bloodborne fans feel a tad… trolled by PlayStation. For example, last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-freak-out-again-as-playstation-anniversary-trailer-ends-on-bloodborne-and-the-phrase-its-about-persistence">Bloodborne fans freaked out over a potential announcement</a> after Sony ended its special PlayStation 30th Anniversary trailer with a clip from the beloved FromSoftware game and the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, given Shuhei’s theory, fans will need plenty of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>It has been many years since we last heard anything about a new Bloodborne game, despite there clearly being demand for one. And I am not just talking about a brand new game under the Bloodborne banner. There hasn't even been word of a remaster, despite several other PlayStation games such as The Last of Us and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile">Horizon Zero Dawn receiving a console refresh in the last few years</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and God of War (including sequel Ragnarök) have also seen a PC release, following their time as a PlayStation exclusive. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wants-to-know-what-your-favourite-playstation-game-is-as-long-as-it-isnt-bloodborne">the same can not be said for poor old Bloodborne</a>, even though this is many a hunter's dream.</p>
<p>So, why is that? Well, former Sony Interactive Entertainment exec and PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has a theory.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Yoshida was asked if we will ever see Bloodborne again, and with a nervous chuckle, Yoshida acknowledged this was a hot topic.</p>
<p>"Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X," he replied. "And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?" He joked some fans have become "frustrated" by how many games PlayStation has remastered, and yet Bloodborne has not been one of them.</p><p>Yoshida then continued to state he thinks a very key factor in Bloodborne's lack of a remaster or similar comes down to one quite simple thing - the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> is "so busy", it has just not been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," Yoshida reasoned.</p>
<p>Yoshida therefore believes the PlayStation team is simply respecting Miyazaki's wish, and doing just that - not touching it.</p>
<p>Yoshida stressed again this was just his own personal theory as to why news regarding anything Bloodborne-flavoured has been non-existent, but it certainly seems a reasonable assumption. Miyazaki has, after all, been rather tied up with the phenomenon that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> in recent years.</p>

</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Miyazaki spoke to Eurogamer about Bloodborne</a>, stating he was "very happy" to see so many passionate fans calling for a remake to happen.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p>
<p>As for Yoshida, just yesterday it was revealed the former exec had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">landed his first voice acting job following his departure from PlayStation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>

        <p>There are several surprise nominations and absences this year</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last year's defining indie smash hit, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>? Not nominated for the IGF grand prize. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, which turned damn near every games journalist into a tiresome obsessive?

It <em>did</em> get a Grand Prize nomination. 
</p>
<p>I don't disagree with any of the nominees or absences in this year's Independent Games Festival Awards, so I don't mention any of the above to stir up trouble. Instead I look at this list and think: wow, video games are more varied than ever, so much so that there's no longer a dominant cultural narrative even within the specific niche of indie gaming.
</p>

<p>If you're not familiar: the IGF Awards have been running for 26 years and the winners are announced during GDC. The nominees, and the winners, are selected by a collection of developers and journalists. It is one of the few video game awards that doesn't just seem like a straightforward popularity contest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is shaping up to be something special. It’s set to be released worldwide on February 4, but per a recent claim, there’s one country out there that won’t be able to access the game.</p>



<p>It was recently reported by a Saudi Arabian news outlet – VGA4A – that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been banned in the country because it features ‘unskippable gay scenes’ in the story. I’ve already picked up this claim with Warhorse Studios and Plaion for clarification, but the full report is detailed below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kcd2-banned-in-saudi-arabia">Is KCD2 Banned in Saudi Arabia?</h2>



<p>It’s not far-fetched to imagine that Saudi Arabia would ban a game for featuring LGBTQ sequences. That has happened before – and it can easily happen again.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <strong>does </strong>feature sexual sequences and nudity, but so far during my preview of the game, I’ve yet to stumble upon any LGBTQ themes bar a couple of romantic conversation options with a same-sex character. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, of course – just like it doesn’t mean that the report published by VGA4A is legitimate, and as such, it should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>



<div><article><p><span>عاجل ورسمي: 

حظر لعبة Kingdom Come Deliverance Il في السعودية، بسبب وجود مشاهد شذوذ غير قابلة للتخطي في طور القصة ❌❌❌</span></p></article></div>







<p>Most recently, Saudi Arabia banned The Last of Us Part II for depictions of a same-sex relationship and the inclusion of a trans character. Those elements were pivotal to the unfolding of the story, so for the censorship agencies in Saudi Arabia, that ‘made more sense’ than a cutscene in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>I’ll also stress that I’ve not come across a single cutscene in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that couldn’t be skipped, which casts further doubt upon this claim.</p>



<p>Again, I’ve reached out to both the developer and publisher for clarification and will update this article when I have more information.</p>

            <p>I adore <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>, to the point that I've finished the uplifting, playful mountain ascent three times. When I tell this to people, one of the most common responses is: hey, you should play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lil-gator-game">Lil Gator Game</a>. I have played Lil Gator Game, and yep: it's good, too. A similarly knockabout outdoor adventure with a cast of vibrant characters. Now it's getting a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1586800/view/509568716255527704">"game-sized"</a> expansion called Lil Gator Game: In The Dark.

<p>Seemingly following on from the events of the original, In The Dark takes place in caves underneath the island you've explored so far. There are new characters to meet and toys to play with, but even underground it seems like you'll be climbing and gliding just as before. I suppose it makes sense, given the original took obvious influence from Breath Of The Wild, that this followup might take some influence from Tears Of The Kingdom - at least as far as an underground setting goes, anyway.
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet.
</p>
<p>I haven't finished Lil Gator Game, but I intend to. It has that CoverGirl energy in that it's easy, breezy, beautiful, with Lil Gator trying desperately to get their older sister's attention and having adventures around an autumnal island in the process. Every corner of it seems stuffed with something playful to do, and there's combat (with cardboard weapons) but very little sense of risk or challenge. Just a good time, from what I played.
</p>
<p>Hayden (RPS in peace) agreed, giving it a Bestest Best in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lil-gator-game-review">Lil Gator Game review</a>. Hopefully In The Dark follows in kind whenever it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205060/Lil_Gator_Game_In_the_Dark/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Making a game about emotionally wayward 20-somethings in a band? You have my sympathies. Night In The Woods nailed the assignment so thoroughly, and is so beloved, that you're in for some tough comparisons. Afterlove EP has plenty going for it that makes it seem like it might be able to hold its own, however. It's set in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, for one. It was conceived of by the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>, another beloved game, for another.

<p>Maybe I'd have released it the day <em>after</em> Valentine's Day.
</p>
<p>Afterlove EP tells the story of Rama, a musician dealing with the unexpected passing of his girlfriend, Cinta. Rama is working on finishing an EP of music he promised he'd make for her, while struggling to get his band back together and grieve his partner. It's described by its creators as a mix of "narrative adventure, visual novel, rhythm game and life/dating sim", which yes, means there's rhythm game segments where you're playing with your band.
</p><p>The game is being developed by Pikselnesia, an Indonesian indie studio founded by Mohammad Fahmi, the creator of Coffee Talk. Coffee Talk was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/coffee-talk-review">mellow visual novel</a> about making hot drinks and chatting with customers in a coffee shop, and several RPSers fell for its cosy atmosphere. Fahmi passed away during development of Afterlove EP in March, 2022.

<p>We hope to have a review of Afterlove EP near to release. In the meantime, you'll find more screenshots and trailers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599780/Afterlove_EP/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kick.com surfaced in 2022, emerging as a legitimate competitor to platforms like Twitch and YouTube. After a rocky and controversial birthing period, Kick stabilised, pulling in many users thanks to a lucrative revenue-sharing scheme that promised to reimburse creators for their time spent on the site.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and Kick has secured 50 million users, proving it’s not just a flash in the pan and it’s most likely here to stay, controversy or not.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-consistent-growth">Consistent Growth</h2>



<p>Kick was a stigmatised platform from the outset. It was plagued by issues such as a lack of content moderation and the adoption of controversial creators, some of whom were responsible for the platform receiving a negative brand very early on.</p>



<p>Things have more or less turned around for the site, and while it’s not yet as powerful as Twitch, it’s trailing just behind the Amazon-backed streaming site.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Kick revealed that 50 million users have found their way onto the streaming platform, which is not a number to be scoffed at. It’s always tough to build a <strong>new </strong>site like this, as the first people to make their way on board will be streamers, which means you inevitably build a user base made up entirely of <strong>creators </strong>and not <strong>viewers</strong>.</p>



<p>That doesn’t seem to be the case with Kick.com.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed an intention <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/">to purchase TikTok US</a> from ByteDance, a shocking revelation that could have drastic implications for the content creation market. TikTok is the number one ‘shorts’ video-sharing platform in the world, and it has access to 170 million users in the United States.</p>



<p>Have you got a Kick.com account, or are you not interested in the platform? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us-from-bytedance-it%E2%80%99s-suggested.1083654/</guid>

<p>It has been revealed on social media – perhaps in jest – that the Stake-backed streaming platform, Kick.com, intends to procure TikTok’s US assets from ByteDance Ltd. This revelation was uncovered in an image uploaded in response to Mr Beast suggesting he and ‘some billionaires’ are preparing to buy TikTok’s US platform ahead of the application’s nationwide ban.</p>



<p>Kick.com emerged in December 2022 as a competitor to YouTube and Twitch, and it has grown pretty quickly in a relatively short time. Is there enough in the platform’s coffers to purchase a US ‘version’ of TikTok? This post suggests there is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-proposal">The Proposal</h2>



<p>On Twitter (X), Kick’s social media team shared a semi-redacted image of a ‘letter of intent’ to purchase a business. In this case, the business is ‘TikTok U.S.’, and it’ll be acquired from the grip of ByteDance Ltd, the Beijing-based tech titan that owns the TikTok application, amongst many others.</p>











<p>The image suggested the document is 69 pages long and that the transaction would include ‘real estate’ in California in the form of a 120,000-square-foot campus.</p>



<p>The amount Kick.com would be paying for TikTok wasn’t disclosed, but judging from the length of the redaction, it looks as though it would be in the billions of dollars. It’s also noted that the purchase is for a ‘percentage ownership interest in the business’, which suggests it might not be an outright acquisition.</p>



<p>The full document was kept hidden, with Kick.com sharing only the top page.</p>



<p>Do you think this is legitimate, or is it just Kick’s social media team having fun with Mr Beast and everyone involved? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> and learn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/">what the TikTok ban means</a> for US application users.</p>

<p>A recent report published by Epyllion sums up the state of the games industry in more than two hundred pages. This gargantuan analysis examines everything from consumer spending to hardware records, giving readers critical insights into the last decade or so of gaming knowledge.</p>



<p>It reveals that, based on key data points from multiple sources, PC gaming has become increasingly powerful over the last decade or so, breezing past console platforms and generating more content spending and revenue.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pc-power">PC Power</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">Epyllion’s report</a> (tracked down by <a href="https://fictionhorizon.com/pc-gaming-outsells-consoles-and-becomes-the-industrys-bright-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FictionHorizon</a>), the cold, hard facts are made clear.</p>



<p>One slide revealed that since 2011, PC’s content spend has dominated ‘living room’ console revenue by more than 65%, and it has earned 225% more than ‘combined console’ spend. That’s a total of $30 billion if you want to put a number on it.</p>



<p>Those numbers <strong>exclude </strong>hardware and accessories.</p>



<p>The report also showed that mobile gaming is leagues ahead of both PC and console platforms, representing the number one money maker in the games industry.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: Epyllion</figcaption></figure>



<p>This stat has been recorded despite an $18 billion increase in spending on console platforms in 2024 compared to 2011. That 75% increase is still trumped by content spend on PC platforms.</p>



<p>But why is PC becoming increasingly popular and much more profitable?</p>



<p>Epyllion suggested it boils down to a few core reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC platforms have a much larger library of games and ‘near-full backwards compatibility’</li>



<li>On a PC, you can multi-task (stream, communicate, alt+tab, multiple monitors)</li>



<li>Lower entry price point than consoles</li>



<li>Higher top-end performance</li>



<li>Better for esports and competitive gaming</li>



<li>Able to play more early-access games</li>



<li>More annual game releases</li>



<li>Console ‘exclusives’ are now finding their way to PC</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s easy to see where some of the money comes from. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘skin market’, which debuted in 2013, is now worth around $5 billion, and it’s tied exclusively to PC.</p>



<p>Home console sales have slumped somewhat in this generation compared to previous ‘eras’, while PC gaming continues to consistently show growth. With the rise of content creation, streaming, and UGC, everyone wants to play on a PC, and technological leaps are making hardware more readily available, powerful, and in many cases, affordable.</p>

Your journey will take you across a wide, diverse world… Just don’t forget that your true goal is to get filthy rich!</p><p>Money is everything! Anything goes, as long as it lines your pockets…and as long as you’re cool with it! Will you walk the path of thievery and plunder, or will you hold firm to your morals? Will you join hands with your friends, or plot to betray them? It’s dealer’s choice around these parts!</p><p>Play even with faraway friends in Online Mode, and feel free to pause your adventure anytime with the Autosave function; it’ll be ready and waiting for you whenever you’re available again!</p><p>There’s also a full range of display settings on offer, including HD and widescreen support, allowing full immersion like never before! Game too slow for you? No problem! Speed options up to 5x ensure you can always keep things moving along at your own pace. A virtually endless array of options allows you to play the game your way: you can substitute in battle background music from earlier titles, set the number of weeks to play, adjust game balance, and more! You can even give yourself an advantage if you’re new to the <em>Dokapon</em> experience; come one, come all, as this game’s for everybody!</p><p>The Iron Sword of Rage returns to cut through all the nonsense of the 2020s in style.

Will your opponent be able to read you?

(Lost them all to <em>Dokapon</em> fights?) No problem! Online multiplayer’s got your back. The world’s your oyster now!</li><li>Best of all, you can stop playing anytime you’d like (you swear!), then jump right back into the fray later on by loading up your save data!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Utilize the speed multiplier and up the game’s tempo to your liking!</strong><ul><li>Yes, you can even speed things up to make the game match your pace.</li><li>At 3x or 5x speed, even the busiest players have no excuse not to give <em>Dokapon</em> a try!</li><li>The speed multiplier can even be used online, cutting down wait times and making the sparks fly faster than ever!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Add some sugar and spice to make everything twice as nice!</strong><ul><li>Call them X-factors or secret ingredients; either way, you can access them in the System menu and rebalance the whole game as you see fit!</li><li>Just give it a pinch of this and a dash of that—only as much as you’d like.</li><li>Maybe turn down the number of rounds, for example, if you’ve got a busy schedule and can’t quite handle the usual length?</li><li>Or fine-tune the gameplay experience by giving yourself infinite magic, or limiting the number of times Wallace appears!</li><li>You can even change the background music to some classic battle themes from past <em>Dokapon</em> games, for that little extra kick of nostalgia!</li><li>What would a remaster be, after all, without that certain “je ne sais quoi” that gives this series its edge?</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just weeks after publicly releasing the Liberty City Preservation Project - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - its developers have confirmed the project is being taken down following conversations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Liberty City Preservation Project - which modding team World Travel has been working on since 2018 - generated significant interest when it launched earlier this month, giving GTA 5 players a chance to explore GTA 4 protagonist Niko Bellic's old stomping ground. It featured the entire Liberty City map -  complete with traffic, pedestrians, weather, and more - alongside improvements such as overhauled lighting, better textures, and new scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the mod's enthusiastic reception also set it on a collision course with Rockstar, and the Liberty City Preservation Project is now officially no more. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/">Insider Gaming</a>, lead modder nkjellman announced its end on Discord, writing, "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project."

<p>
"We appreciate all the support the project has received," nkjellman continued, "and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."
</p>
<p>
Nkjellman didn't specify what had drawn Rockstar's ire, but the studio has frowned on similar mods before. Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. So it seems likely that's where the Liberty City Preservation Project has fallen foul of Rockstar's rules.
</p><p>
Perhaps notable, too, is the fact an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">official GTA 4 remaster</a> was reported to have been in the works back in 2022. At the time, the project was said to have been shelved due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">poor reception</a> of 2021's GTA: The Trilogy remasters - but the report also referenced a supposedly canned Red Dead Redemption remaster that did eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">show up in 2023</a>. It's possible Rockstar's rumoured GTA 4 remaster is also alive and well, which might have contributed to the Liberty City Preservation Project's swift slap-down. But regardless, 2025 is a massive year for the long-running series, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">currently expected to release this "autumn"</a>.

And some mods, like the Vice City mod, were taken down only for Rockstar themselves to announce remasters of those very games. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't to say Rockstar is working on a GTA 4 remaster, by any means, but there's certainly precedent. Still it may be years away before we get an answer as we know Rockstar is currently hard at work trying to ready the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 for a 2025 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
