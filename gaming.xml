            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has clarified that Switch 2 Edition cartridges will contain both the original Switch version of the game in question and the Switch 2 upgrade, meaning you won't have to download anything extra to play them.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to Australian Nintendo news platform <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vooks</a>, Nintendo said that physical Switch 2 Edition games will "include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card".</p>

<p>Nintendo goes on to say that "no download code" will be included in Switch 2 Edition packs and that the cartridges therein will be "exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards". Good news if you were hoping to resell your Switch 2 Edition games at some point, or if your internet connection is spotty.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=__wNfzGO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=2EilFBrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several games, like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, will be getting Switch 2 Edition versions with console-specific upgrades.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, however, Nintendo then says that "some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging" if they choose, and that such releases would contain "no game card".</p>

<p>In essence, then, first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will always contain both the original game and the upgrade code, but that might not be the case for third-party publishers. Caveat emptor, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just in case you've somehow missed the hubbub, the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced in full last week</a>, with a worldwide release date of June 5th and a US price (for now, at least) of $449.99, jumping to $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>Though the console is still on track to launch on June 5th, pre-orders have been delayed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">the US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> due to President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs. Nintendo also appears to be weighing up whether releasing the Switch 2 in China <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">will be worth its while</a>.</p>




<p>Games confirmed to be getting Switch 2 Editions so far include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Not all of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launching alongside the console</a>, though.</p>

How? By encouraging people to interact with an AI chatbot while in a theater watching a movie on the big screen. Does this sound like a good idea? Nope!

The idea is that people in the theater will be able to use their phone to chat with a <em>Megan</em>-themed AI chatbot, answer trivia questions, and read behind-the-scenes tidbits. </p><p> I don’t care how much of a boomer this makes me: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935">don’t use your phone in a movie theater</a></span>. If you are worried about an emergency, leave it on buzz and exit the theater before checking your device. Otherwise, mute that shit and enjoy two hours in a dark room separated from the nightmare that is the internet in 2025. </p><p> “The question we always ask ourselves is why can’t every day be Halloween? So Halfway to Halloween brings us one step closer, and I couldn’t be happier that this year we are going nationwide,” said Jason Blum, founder and CEO of Blumhouse, in a statement. “In that same spirit of trying new things, we’re excited to give <em>Megan</em> fans an all-new experience in theaters from the team at Meta.” </p><p>I do find it very funny that Meta and Blumhouse are pitching this tech as “new” despite second screen experiences being a thing that companies tried over a decade ago. Remember Xbox SmartGlass? That was an app you’d open on your tablet or phone and then use while playing games or watching movies on your Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690">It had some uses</a></span>, but wasn’t really a thing anybody cared about. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So Xbox killed it and moved on</a></span>. Yet, here’s Meta bringing the concept back, while making it <em>more</em> annoying than before by cramming in AI and encouraging people to use their phones while in a movie theater. </p><p>I can only hope that, like most new ideas big tech has these days, this Movie Mate thing quietly fails and is never mentioned again.

<p>Marathon developers have confirmed that players will not need a PSN account to play the game on PC and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-doesn-t-require-psn-on-xbox-and-pc">Marathon Doesn’t Require PSN on Xbox and PC</h2>



<p>With Marathon being a Sony-backed project, many players worried they might need a PSN account to play the game on other platforms. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted, Bungie has removed these worries through a message on the game’s official Discord channel. The developers have explicitly stated, “Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox.”</p>



<p>Several of PlayStation’s initial releases on PC came with a PSN account requirement. Many might remember the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing fiasco with Helldivers 2</a> when it was released on Steam in early 2024. Since then, PlayStation has learned that players on other platforms do not wish to use a PSN account and have made the sign-up optional and also tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivise </a>it for their recent releases like The Last of Us 2 Remastered, God of War Ragnarök and more. And now, with the latest confirmation, Marathon can be added to the list of games that don’t require a PSN account.</p>



<p>Marathon has been under wraps since its initial reveal, but players will finally learn more about the game on April 12. Bungie has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-showcase-announced-for-april-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal showcase</a> for their upcoming PvP extraction shooter. In 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the loot system</a> works in the game.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marathon not requiring a PSN account on other platforms? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider TV series from Amazon and Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks to no longer be happening.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html">Daily Mail</a> sources, the project is - much like many animals and people that Lara Croft crosses paths with - "dead". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to reports that Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">Sophie Turner was set to star as the series' globe-trotting lead</a>, a source said that "this is not going ahead".</p>

<p>The Mail's report comes after <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jennifer-salke-steps-down-as-head-of-amazon-mgm-studios-segues-to-producing-with-first-look-deal/ar-AA1BNwen?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Jennifer Salke announced she was stepping down as head of Amazon MGM Studios</a> after seven years. Salke was a driving force behind getting Phoebe Waller-Bridge on board with Amazon.</p>
<p>According to an interview with Puck, and reported by <a href="https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-show-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-no-script-report/">Screen Rant</a>, Waller-Bridge is yet to even produce a script for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>"Tomb Raider, which Waller-Bridge has been working on and which Salke was personally overseeing after announcing a series pickup last May, has now gone through two writers rooms and tens of millions of dollars in development costs," reads the report.</p>
<p>While things aren't looking promising for Amazon's Tomb Raider series, the company is yet to officially announce the project has been scrapped. Eurogamer has contacted the company for more information.</p>

<p>We first got wind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Waller-Bridge's Tomb Raider Amazon series in 2023</a>, before it was firmed up further in May last year.</p>
<p>"If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she'd explode,"  <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series">said Waller-Bridge at that time</a>. "Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. </p>
<p>
"Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can't wait to go on this adventure. Bats 'n all."

<p>Along with the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>, but did not elaborate much further than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bloodborne-demons-souls-producer-establishes-new-game-company-sirius-studio-following-departure-from-sie-japan-studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Toriyama's new venture will be called Sirius Studio, and it's been opened under the auspices of Osaka's Gz Group, which is usually focused on creating games in the PC and mobile spaces, as well as VR games.</p>

<p>Despite that, Automaton says Toriyama's Sirius Studio will be focusing on making "high-end console" games, as well as VR and XR (virtual and extended reality) titles. Sirius' efforts will span a range of both new and existing IPs as well.</p>

<p>Toriyama's time as a producer with Sony's Japan Studio includes credits on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>(both in its original form and its remade version),&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and the PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Freedom Wars</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">got a remaster earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>He left Japan Studio, as well as Sony as a whole, in 2020, and his former outfit was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2021</a>&nbsp;(which may be a significant contributing factor in the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake).</p>

<p>After working with Sony, Toriyama moved to&nbsp;<em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>developer Thirdverse, but according to a Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/38560" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> (with Automaton's translation), he left when it became clear Thirdverse was shifting away from higher-end console and PC game development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=kEcz4bBA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=Y5pYAc2r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>studio Thirdverse wouldn't prove to be Teruyuki Toriyama's permanent home.</figcaption></figure><p>What Toriyama will do with Sirius Studio remains to be seen, but the studio enters the industry at a time when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">many</a> are finding it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn" rel="nofollow">difficult</a> to secure or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">maintain funding</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, layoffs are still sweeping across the industry, affecting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">bigger</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">smaller</a> studios alike. Toriyama certainly faces a challenge in founding a new studio and creating a high-budget game in this climate, so let's hope he and Sirius can surmount that challenge.</p>

            <p>Just in case you were getting anxious about needing a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - on PC and Xbox, I have good news - you won't!</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message:</p>

<p>The conversation around the PlayStation Network - which is an online gaming and media content distribution service - kicked off last year, when Sony announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">retroactively making accounts mandatory for Helldivers 2 on PC</a>. At this time, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> publisher said this was all to do with safety and security, adding it was always meant to be a requirement for Helldivers 2 players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period of time.</p>
<p>However, the company's decision was met with intense backlash from the community, which included the game getting an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">influx of negative reviews on Steam</a>. Sony ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned its-then plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on PC</a>, and has since softened its PSN stance further afield.</p>
<p>In January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">Sony announced it was going to be removing those mandated PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its PC releases, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered.</p>
<p>It still wants to give players an incentive to sign up to a PSN account, though. On the PC release of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered earlier this month, the team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">Sony used the promise of 50 in-game points to activate bonus features</a>, along with a new Ellie skin featuring<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion"> Jordan A. Mun's jacket from Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> to entice players to login.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unknown if Sony will do something similar to encourage players to use a PSN account while playing Marathon. We have asked PlayStation for a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 pricing pressure in the United States has eased thanks to the pausing of the tariffs announced last week, and the console will likely be widely available at its announced price when it launches on June 5th.</p>
<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDI2Mzk0NywiZXhwIjoxNzQ0ODY4NzQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVUg2WTRUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZEIyQWKfjdHBpVs7zO7eZStqT-Y5Xj20QhPKsgOroaw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> suggests there should be more than enough units available to meet demand, as per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">company's plans</a>. According to new customs data provided by NBD, Hosiden Corp, one of the three main Nintendo Switch 2 assemblers based in Vietnam, shipped a total of 785,700 units in February, 725,200 of them to the United States in February, more units than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. With the looming threat of the tariffs, Nintendo can focus all the production in Vitenam to the United States, suggesting millions of consoles can be shipped from the country in time for the June launch.</p>
<p>As for how the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 could be impacted by the tariffs after launch, there's more uncertainty. According to Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu, if the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo will probably keep the announced $499.99 price and take a hit on the margins, given how the company will want to have a thriving system that could expand its user base and make its diversification strategy centered on its iconic IPs even more successful. If they are raised to 46%, however, the system's price is expected to increase between $50 and $100.</p>
<p>Considering the latest developments, there's a very good chance Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will finally begin in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">Canada</a> after having been delayed last week in preparation for its June 5th launch. Not every Nintendo fan in the world, however, will be able to get the system on that day, as it has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely in China.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft's lawyers have responded to a legal action from players of defunct racing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> by insisting that those players never owned the game in the first place. The players made their lawsuit to complain about the game being made unplayable when servers were shut down last year, but Ubisoft have now responded to argue that the game was only "licensed" to those playing, and players should never have expected the game to be useable in perpetuity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft's legal team made the argument in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon">a motion to have the case dismissed</a>, as seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"The Crew's ordinary, intended purpose was to provide consumers with a revocable, limited license to access its content pursuant to the unmistakable warnings on the product packaging and Ubisoft's Terms of Use," reads part of the filing. "Plaintiffs received just that for years, and Ubisoft therefore provided The Crew consistent with and fit for its ordinary, advertised purpose."</p>
<p>Ubisoft go on to argue that the game being under a non-permanent licence was clearly stated on some of their packaging. They also say that the statute of limitations to make this sort of complaint is up, and that the shutdown of the game caused no "cognizable injury" and therefore the case should be dismissed by the California district court which is looking at it. The plaintiffs make a counter-argument that some vouchers for the game had an expiry date of "2099", which implies the statute of limitations is not up.</p>
<p>Ubisoft made The Crew unplayable when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">took the servers offline</a> last year, ending 10 years of support for the open world racing game. It started disappearing from game libraries shortly afterwards, making any hopes of a fan preservation movement (as sometimes happens with defunct MMOs) more unlikely. Eventually, some players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-is-being-sued-over-the-crew-in-a-lawsuit-that-compares-the-server-shutdown-to-a-bumperless-pinball-machine">launched the class-action lawsuit</a> which Ubi are now trying to get dismissed. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p>
<p>It may be a significant legal case in the event it's brought to court proper (although these things are often settled or dismissed before it gets that far). Valve make similar "it's only a license" arguments about all those unplayed JRPGs clogging up your Steam library, and now show <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">a more prominent warning</a> that you're actually only buying a digital license when you buy a game on their store. This is also the reason why you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-leave-your-steam-backlog-to-someone-else-in-your-will">won't be able to legally pass on your Steam library</a> after you die in that terrible go-karting accident, at least according to Valve. </p>
<p>Our worries over whether or not you actually own anything you download can be traced back to time immemorial (or at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thought-do-we-own-our-steam-games">back to 2012</a>). And Ubisoft's latest comments are a further digging in of corporate heels on this legality. As for The Crew itself, it was an OK racing game - nothing very special in my book - but I do have fond memories of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-free-road-trip">a cross-country road trip</a> in the game with Adam (RPS in peace).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A port of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD on Nintendo Switch 2 is still a possibility, despite the original GameCube release being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/">Nintendo Switch Online library.</a></p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinda Funny Games</a> during last week's press event, which allowed media to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD could still be released on the new system, as all options are on the table. While the port hasn't been confirmed, it has been highlighted how games being available via the Nintendo Switch Online service hasn't prevented other versions of said games from being released on the original Switch, so there's still hope to see the remaster breaking free from the Wii U captivity it has been since its release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 Reviews Are In! - Kinda Funny Games Daily 04.08.25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=2477&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, we have been hearing rumors of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD getting ported to Nintendo Switch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">quite some time</a>, but neither game has ever materialized, leaving fans no other option than playing the Wii U releases. While both games feature plenty of improvements over the original releases, Zelda: Wind Waker HD definitely sports the most significant changes, with plenty of gameplay improvements that make it, together with the enhanced visuals, the definitive way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series to date.</p>

<p>The clip kicks off mid-quest. We're on what looks like a mining planet, all sandstone cliffs and crystalline bunches. Indulging in a little showcasey arsenal appreciation, we admire our knife, a slimy slime pistol, and a glowing Toys R Us does Art Deco Scythe. Art Deco's the theme, actually. We soon approach an open plaza overlooked by a mythologising mural that evokes similar art from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a>'s Talos I.</p>
<p>"Everything must become nothing, before it can become everything," blasts a tannoy. Distinctly meaningless middle management motivational slogan tier as far as proclamations of evil go, that, but I don't mind a "we must first punch the world to bits before making it good" villain, done well. We sneak up through the plaza, followed by our companion Aza. She's also a cultist, and she keeps calling the other cultists "traitors". We approach an enemy, select our knife, and Aza says "It's killing time!". That is my third least favourite thing a companion can say, Aza.</p>
<p>We stealth stab one cultist, but their body is immediately spotted by another. No matter! We have guns, grenades, and slo-mo - a combination that makes us too pathologically impatient to wait for grenades to create an honest god-fearing explosion on their own time, and so we shoot ours mid-air. Yep, that'll do it. A bit more shooting, and we're inside.</p>
<p>We follow bloody footprints inside the building until we meet a science lady named Exemplar Foxworth. We can immediately tell she's a science lady because she starts breathlessly babbling calculations, as all good pop culture scientists are contractually obligated to do. Whoa! Slow down there, braniac! Can you say that again….<em>in English!</em> She's been left bleeding out via slapdash exsanguination, but it looks like we either don't have high enough medical skills or a kit to patch her up. Conversational skill checks, check.</p>
<p>She fills you in on the situation. The cult has been going billy bear blood sausage nutso around the facility. "Is there any science around here we use to find and kill them?", asks your companion, quirkaciously. What a delightful whackadoodle whose shtick certainly was not worn out halfway through her very first sentence. Science lady points you to a scanner to locate the invisible cultists. She calls them "visibility impaired".</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry. Just headbutted my keyboard six times in a row then blacked out for a moment. We pass over some electrified corridors and locate the scanner in another room. It's a mask that, indeed, reveals the cultists through infra-red bug vision. We find a few cultists and whack them with the Toys R Us scythe, which looks nicely chunky. "Homicide always cheers me up!", says Aza, evidently unsatisfied with only coming third on my shit list previously.</p>
<p>We return to science lady for some more advice on opening some doors, solve a lever puzzle, then it's off to locate and kill a cultist named Victor. Before that, we take a quick jaunt to show off killable NPCs by putting an end to science lady's calculations for good. Murderable everyone, check. Murderable everyone as a crowdpleasing feature without the branching quest design that would make that feature interesting to begin with? Unconfirmed!</p>
<p>And that's curtains, or hastily shut blinds anyway. Well! I like the art direction. The melee combat looks neat. But can I bank on these enough to buy me a fresh pair of unground teeth each time a character opens their mouths? Starting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">miss Avowed already, honestly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Content Warning: This article includes references to extreme sexual violence, please read on at your own discretion. </strong></p>
<p>Valve has removed a Steam game which contained explicit sexual violence from sale in various countries, including the UK, following media attention. </p>
<p>The Steam page for No Mercy described the game as "a 3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on incest and male domination". Gameplay footage seen by Eurogamer included non-consensual sex.</p>
<p>When No Mercy first came to our attention, Eurogamer contacted Valve for comment regarding the game's themes and graphic content, and asked why it had been allowed onto the PC storefront, but we did not hear back. Now, Valve has quietly removed No Mercy from sale in the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle berated Valve for allowing No Mercy to be sold. "We expect every one of those [tech] companies to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it," Kyle told <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/tech/steam-violent-misogyny-video-game-no-mercy/">LBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-minister-slams-valve-for-explicit-game-promoting-non-consensual-sexual-contact-and-sexual-violence">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "That's what the law requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do."</p>
<p>While No Mercy's Steam page did warn that the game included violent, graphic imagery and themes, Valve's storefront allows anyone to view product pages by simply inputting a date of birth via a drop-down menu, with no further checks necessary. </p>
<p>The Game Ratings Authority, which administers the PEGI system in the UK, stated "games on Steam can optionally apply for a PEGI age rating via our classification process", however this is "not mandated by the platform" ahead of a game's release on the storefront.</p>
<p>It added the Games Rating Authority had "not classified this game" prior to its release on Steam, and nor had it been requested to do so since.</p>
<p>In an additional statement shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO of Women in Games Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman said the organisation was "appalled by recent reports surrounding a Steam game, which encourages players to 'become every woman's worst nightmare' and 'never take no for an answer'."</p>
<p>Isaaman said the availability of games such as No Mercy on Steam was "utterly unacceptable", as it "sends a clear and distressing message: that violence against women is not only tolerable, but playable".</p>
<p>"That message has no place in our industry, our communities, or our society," Isaaman said.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz has also now reported that No Mercy is unavailable for sale in Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has again reached out to Valve for comment on No Mercy, asking why it was ever allowed on Steam, and about its subsequent removal from the platform.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Stellar Crown is back in stock (finally), and Amazon also has the Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection if you're feeling like a true Tera master. Meanwhile, Lenovo quietly dropped Xbox Wireless Controllers to $39.99, and I’m just over here trying to convince myself I <em>don’t</em> need one in every color.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Stellar Crown Boxes and $25 off Xbox Series X/S Controllers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s a new Humble Bundle that looks like someone dumped every neon-drenched game into one lineup, and somehow Fallout fans are getting a $200 Pip-Boy replica that actually works as a clock.

Terapagos ex, Lapras ex, and Cinderace ex look gorgeous, and the display-worthy gear (card protector, playmat, deck box) makes this feel like more than just another TCG drop. It’s overstuffed, overpriced, over the top and exactly what I want from a premium Pokémon box.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-stella"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stella">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218495"><div id="218495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the Stellar Crown ETB is one of the best recent Pokémon releases, and not just because it includes a full-art Noctowl.

You get six booster packs from the latest set, which is hard enough to find in stores, and I appreciate not having to overpay a reseller just to get in on the new pulls. For anyone trying to keep up with the expansion, this is as straightforward as it gets.</p></div><p id="iniu-140w-power-bank"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU 140W Power Bank">INIU 140W Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218399"><div id="218399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 140W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the <strong>INIU 140W 27,000mAh Power Bank</strong> is the backup battery I actually trust when I know I’ll be away from an outlet for more than a few hours. It’s currently <strong>$74.56</strong>, which isn’t exactly pocket change, but for something that can charge a MacBook Pro or a Steam Deck without breaking a sweat, I’d say it’s well-priced. The digital display is genuinely useful, and having three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) makes it easy to keep everything charged without doing the cable shuffle.</p></div><p id="fallout-lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack">Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218400"><div id="218400" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually get excited about merch, but the Fallout – Lucy’s Vault 33 Backpack from the IGN Store actually feels like something I’d use.

This isn’t a cheap cosplay throw-in, it’s got a full 20L capacity, a 16-inch laptop pocket, and more compartments than I know what to do with. Plus, it comes with that massive yellow fleece blanket for the full Fallout-core vibe. I’m not planning on trekking across a wasteland anytime soon, but it’s good to know the bag is ready just in case.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-20000mah-65w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W">INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218401"><div id="218401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use on-site coupon for full discount</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU 65W 20,000mAh Power Bank is the one I reach for when I need power without the bulk.

The extra port flexibility is nice, and the built-in phone stand is one of those small features I didn’t think I’d care about until I started using it constantly.

The lineup is solid, the value is obvious, and part of the money goes to Girls Who Code and Girls Make Games, so I don’t even have to justify it to myself.

Unfortunately for the folks who made it, the answer is pretty likely to immediately be, “Pokemon with guns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because when the game first exploded into popularity, that’s the shorthand everyone on the internet used for it, likely contributing to its rise thanks to the odd combination of two unlike ideas. Heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-snaps-up-pokmon-with-guns-game-palworld-for-game-pass-release-date-confirmed"><u>we at IGN</u></a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-insists-that-its-pokmon-with-guns-survival-game-is-not-a-scam"><u>guilty of using the phrase</u></a> too, just like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1008US1008&amp;oq=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMgYIBRBFGEAyBggGEEUYQDIGCAcQRRhA0gEINDU1NGowajSoAgCwAgDxBSg3gEcuecCb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>everyone else</u></a>. It was convenient and easy for those who had never heard of the game to immediately understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But according to Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, “Pokemon with guns” was never intended to be the takeaway. In fact, he says that Pocketpair largely doesn’t <em>love</em> the moniker. He said this in a talk at the Game Developers Conference last month, when he discussed the initial rise to fame of Palworld in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We revealed the game to the world in June of 2021, so quite a few years ago. We posted a trailer at what's called Indie Live Expo, which is an indie gaming event in Japan. We showed this off to the Japanese audience initially, we had a really, really good reception. But very quickly, Western media got eyes on this little game, and we were very quickly branded, as early as 2021, as a ‘certain franchise’ plus guns. This would be something that has stuck with us to this very day, despite our best efforts to shake that off.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After his talk, I spoke with Buckley in an interview and asked him to elaborate on this. Buckley responded that Pokemon was never really part of the pitch to begin with. Sure, the development team is largely composed of fans of the game, and they clocked the monster-collecting similarities. But the goal was always to be more like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK,” he said. “So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things about ARK, is that everything’s about the dinosaurs. Some are cute, some are cool. But we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing. And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Buckley if he thinks the “Pokemon with guns” label helped Palworld become as successful as it was, and he acknowledges it did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I mean, that was big,” he said. “That was definitely a big thing. Dave [Oshry] from New Blood [Interactive, publisher of Dusk, Fallen Aces, and others] messaged us because he trademarked the website, ‘Pokemonwithguns.com’ and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But still today, 2025, if people want to say [“Pokemon with guns”], that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit, is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Buckley also doesn’t feel that Pokemon is even a meaningful source of market competition with Palworld. “I don’t think the audiences cross over that much,” he said, again pointing to ARK as a neater parallel. Even then, though, he doesn’t feel Palworld is fighting with anyone else in particular for an audience of players. Not even Helldivers 2, which he said a “very significant” portion of Palworld players also bought on release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1881483215208329464" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gotten in trouble for ranting about the ‘console wars’ before</u></a>, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it,” he said. “Almost like a meta-marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with the timing [of releases] more than anything, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if “Pokemon with guns” is out, what tagline would Buckley have had go viral, if he could have had his way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I probably would've called it, ‘Palworld: It's Kind of Like ARK if ARK Met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends’ or something like that. That’s how I might’ve said it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I told him it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the same, to which he agrees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough"><u>Buckley and I also spoke about the</u></a> possibility of Palworld coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>, and much more in our interview.

During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve already run a number of shorter stories on some of the highlights of our conversation with Buckley, but given the depth of insight he provided on Pocketpair’s community struggles and triumphs, we decided to publish the full extended interview here as well. If you’re looking for something a bit shorter and easier to follow, you can read at these links on Buckley’s comments about the possibility of Palworld <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the studio’s reaction to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-arent-fans-of-the-pokemon-with-guns-moniker">the game being called “Pokemon with guns”</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity:
<strong>IGN: I'm going to get the really annoying one that I know you can't really answer out of the way first. You talked so, so lightly about the lawsuit in your GDC talk. Has that lawsuit made it harder for Pocketpair to move forward and update the game, having that still pending?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Buckley:</strong> No, it hasn't made it harder to update the game or to move forward. It's just kind of something that weighs over you all the time. It's something that everyone's always thinking about, but it hasn't made the game harder to update. It hasn't affected development in that regard. It's just kind of affected the company's morale more than anything else. And obviously, lawyers have to be hired and stuff like that, of course, of course, but I'm not involved in any of that, and really no one else at the company is other than the top, right? It's just morale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, real conversation time. I was fascinated at the start of your talk when you talked about, sort of cheekily, the ‘Pokemon with guns’ moniker. I was surprised that you didn't seem to like that. Can I ask why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of people don't believe us when we say this, but I think a lot of people think that was written on a whiteboard before the game development started, like, “This is the goal," but it never was. We always wanted to make something that was kind of like ARK: Survival Evolved, but with a lot more automation and with a bit more personality to each of the creatures, because a lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK. So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things that ARK, everything's done with the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs, some of them are cute, but we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said in the talk that you didn't understand why Palworld took off the way it did, you couldn't explain it. And I'm not a market analyst, so I certainly couldn't tell you, but I do feel like I specifically remember when "Pokemon with guns" came into the conversation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. No, I mean, that was big. That was definitely a big thing. I mean, Dave [Oshry] Dave from New Blood messaged us because he trademarked the website, Pokemonwithguns.com and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough. But still today, 2025, if people want to say that, that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, how would you have phrased it? What would've been your "moniker" for this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I probably would've called it, “Palworld: It's kind of like ARK if ARK met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends, or something like that. That's how I might've said it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It doesn't quite roll off the tongue the same way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, it doesn't, does it? Maybe that's why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that you brought up in the talk were the criticisms people made saying the game was AI slop. How did that impact folks internally at Pocketpair?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Massively, massively, massively, massively. That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, "I hate this company. They use AI," and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting. It's something that upsets everyone, but at different levels. It's the artists especially who really, really take it the worst, especially our Pal concept artists. We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn. I talked about that. The easy idea is to put everyone in front of a camera and have them talk about it, but none of our people want to be on camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, when you gave your talk you mentioned people not wanting to be super visible online because the internet is bad.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, they don't want to be visible. And I'm not using it as an excuse, but the vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things. But like I said in my talk, we haven't really cracked how to properly refute this yet. We released an art book, and it definitely, definitely made a big impact, but not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We are having this industry-wide conversation about generative AI and generative AI art, and people think that they're really good at spotting it, and you can't always. If something has seven weird fingers, it's probably pretty obvious, but less so in other cases, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of the arguments for ours, I think, again, I'm obviously biased towards this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ai-palworld-accusations-are-currently-based-on-vibes-a-social-deduction-game-and-the-ceos-past-tweets-about-machine-generated-fakemon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I think they're pretty hollow</a>. I mean, it all comes from comments that our CEO made in 2020, 2021-ish. There was a very famous Kotaku post. Before GenAI really became a thing, Kotaku made an article about it, and our CEO commented, "Sugoi," the Japanese word for amazing. People see the word amazing, and they think his reaction's like, "Whoa, this is incredible. I love this." And I think his intention was more just like a, "Look at this thing." I don't think he was too gung-ho on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, I think the thing that really kind of tipped it for people is in 2022, 2023, two people... So Pocketpair is what we call an open development company. So you join Pocketpair, and then you work on the game you want to work on rather than we're hiring you to specifically work on this. We check that you can do the work. You join the company. And then, you want to work on Craftopia? Cool. You want to work on Palword? Cool. You want to just do your own thing? Okay, we'll let you do that for a period of time, and if that might become something, maybe we can help you make that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Never Grave, another game we're doing, actually came from that model of people having this idea, they pursued it, and we let them do it. Two or three members of Pocketpair made a game a few years ago called AI: Art Imposter, which is a party game. [<em>Author's note: AI Imposter does involve players generating AI images in a social deduction game format where the "imposter" isn't told the theme of the generation</em>.] Well, that didn't go down the way we thought it would go down. I think we all thought it would be a funny, ironic kind of a thing. Here's a party game where you're trying to catch out the person, but it didn't matter. People take that as our declaration of "We love GenAI." It'll be quite the opposite, but again, it is what it is. Art Imposter was popular in Japan, so like a lot of our games, we're happy that somewhere enjoyed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's your overall take on the state of, not your community specifically, but online gaming communities in general? You're talking about getting all that harassment and stuff, is social media broadly useful for you all anymore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Well, social media's big for us. Funny enough, I went to a publisher roundtable yesterday, and it was very split in the middle, actually. The same question came up. Some of us think, yes, that's the way to go. Some people think it's not the way to go anymore. It's big for us. It's big for us because we are primarily an Asian market game. All of our games have been big in Japan and China and stuff, and these are places where social media is like people live and breathe it. You can't ignore it. Whereas over here, I know there's a bit more pushback. Online gaming communities, yeah, they can be very intense sometimes. I think people get very emotional sometimes and they get very swept away in those emotions, and I understand that. I mean, I used to play a lot of MMOs, a lot of PvP MMOs. That used to be my big thing before I got a real job. The communities, but I understand that people get swept away in things and you kind of lash out, and I get that. And there's a lot of people that lash out at us that I just kind of take on the chin. I'm like, "That's fine."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's all this death-threat stuff. It's when it reaches that point where you're like, "How could you be this upset?" It's never that serious. And it's usually very illogical death threats. Maybe we release a patch that breaks something, and, "I'm going to kill you and put a knife in your neck." And I always just want to say, "Do you think we're not going to fix it? I mean, we'll obviously fix this, right? We didn't do this on purpose. We're not breaking your game on purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think the big thing that a lot of people don't sympathize with is you might play a game, you might play our game for three hours in a row, and then you experience a critical bug, and it crashes. That's a super frustrating experience. I 100% agree, I sympathize, I get it. But then you disconnect from it, and you go and do something else. We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen. So, I wish people would be a bit more sympathetic to these things, that we don't like it as much as they like it, and we're trying to fix these things. So, a bit of heat is fine. Spur of the moment insults is fine. I get it. We're all people, but it's the death threats that really get to us the most because it's so dumb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you feel like social media is trending worse lately?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think, especially these days, there's a lot more people on social media who just say the opposite thing because they know they'll get the reaction now. And it's trending a bit and there's a few big accounts that have become quite notorious for always seeming to be on the opposite side. A new game comes out and everyone's like, "This is great." There's always that crowd now that go, "Nope, this is not. It's bad," for all these reasons that have nothing to do with the game, basically, always. And I think that, I don't know, maybe social media is encouraging that recently. It gets the clicks, it gets the trends. Yeah, luckily, we don't get much of that. Palworld, weirdly enough, kind of has avoided a lot of these, I don't know, I don't know what you say, political and social stuff. We just get a lot of "The game's broken" kind of requests. That's what we get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I thought it was really interesting in your talk that you said that the majority of the heat came from the Western audience. I guess I just assumed it would be equal across the board. Do you have any insight as to why that was?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, no, no. We've tried to figure this out too. We are quite a divisive company in Japan. It's a 50/50 in Japan of whether people love us or whether people really hate us. I don't know. I think not a lot of game companies in Japan make games for the overseas market. They make a game for home, and then it blows up overseas, whereas we always try to strike overseas first with the kind of Japanese flair to it. And we call ourselves indie a lot, which a lot of Japanese gamers don't like, unfortunately. Even though we firmly believe we're indie, but yeah, that's always contested back home. I don't know why we get a lot of heat overseas. Maybe it was just easy pickings at that time. It's simmered down a lot. It's very manageable now. But a lot of that, especially the death threats and stuff, were very much in English. We didn't get a lot of that in Japan or China.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Palworld was extremely successful, and I get the sense, perhaps in a way that was maybe unexpected for you all based on your talk. Has that changed anything about how the studio runs or what your future plans are or anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: It's changed our future plans, yes. It has not changed the studio. For better or worse, we remain basically unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said the community team did not get bigger in response. Did the studio get bigger in other ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. I mean, our server team has grown. We're hiring more developers all the time. We're hiring more artists all the time. One of our sore points as a company is just making things quicker for the fans. So we're always trying to onboard as many developers as we can to kind of speed up development time. But the company culture hasn't changed that much. It's obviously bigger now, but we haven't reached that kind of tipping point yet. And our CEO really wants to avoid that because he's a very homebody kind of guy, so he wants to keep it small. I say small, it's 70 people now. That's a lot of people. He doesn't want to get into the hundreds, he says, anyway. But no, I mean, this level of success was unexpected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You knew it was a good game, but you didn't know that it was going to be </strong><em><strong>this </strong></em><strong>big.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, a million sales for anyone, I think you've made it. Well, sorry. I said anyone. I mean a million sales for an indie game. You've made it. Congratulations. You're a platinum standard. Two million? Unbelievable. You should be screaming that from the roof. When you get into the 10 millions is when it just gets very surreal, and you don't really know what's happening anymore. And Steam is sending you, "Here's your monthly sales reports, and here's your monthly impression reports," and it's just numbers that don't make sense. And then you get a bit, not reckless, but you get a bit free with how you spend it and nothing happens. Yeah, it all gets very weird and surreal, and it's still hard for us to kind of get a grasp on it, basically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you anticipate that Palworld is something that Pocketpair is going to support for a really, really long time to come?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea, but it's definitely going to be something that we're always sticking on. But we do want to kind of go back to making other stuff, too. We're still working on Craftopia. Even though everyone says we're not, we are still working on Craftopia. And there's people at the company who want to do their own thing as well, so we're trying to find ways to support all of that while also maintaining this machine that is Palworld. Because Palworld's kind of split into two things now, Palworld the game and Palworld the IP, and they're both kind of going on different trajectories right now.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. You talked about that partnership that everybody misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley:</strong> Yeah. No one understands. Someone, literally yesterday, said to me, "Why aren't you wearing a Sony jacket?" And I said, "Because we're not owned by Sony at all." No, that'll be forever misunderstood, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you think you guys ever would get acquired?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley: </strong>No. Our CEO would never allow it. He'd never allow it. He'd never allow it. He would never, never allow it. He likes doing his own thing and he likes being his own boss. He doesn't like people telling him what to do. So I would be shocked. Maybe when he's old, and he might just sell it off for money. And that would be sad, but in my lifetime, I probably won't see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, it'll be interesting to see where the two paths go. We, Pocketpair, are obviously only involved in where the game path is going. Palworld as an IP, we've given, not given, but we are involved, but very much in the hands of Aniplex and Sony Music who are steering that ship right now. We are just kind of offering our advice and thoughts as they take that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know we talked earlier about the Palworld comparisons to a Pokemon, and that you actually feel it's more like ARK. ARK is not actively releasing brand new games every one to two years and has an anime and merch like the way Pokemon does, but Pokemon is gearing up. They've got a release this year. They're constantly doing stuff. Do you see that being competitive in any way or meaningfully impacting you all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't think the audiences cross over that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Really?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: And the systems are totally different. I mean, the systems are completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sure, but you all released after Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which people including me were very critical of, and I remember seeing a lot of fans going, “Why can’t they just do what Pocketpair did?”</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't know. I think a lot of that's just people trying to stir the pot online. I see some of those comments all the time and I always think, "Come on, guys. Don't be silly now." I think they're just stirring the pot. I mean, we don't consider that as any kind of competition, or we don't want to be involved in that kind of dispute, basically. Ironically, we released alongside two other survival games, and we were more focused on them than we were anyone else, Nightingale and Enshrouded. And we very playfully back and forthed it together, because we are very similar games more than anything else. ARK. I mean, we don't see ARK as a competitor. We love the ARK guys. [Studio] Wildcard are sweethearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know. Competition in games is, I've gotten in trouble for ranting about the "console wars" before, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it. Almost like a meta marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with kind of the timing more than anything, I think. I mean, we pull a lot of telemetry and we work with a lot of data companies for these things. I don't know. The one that surprised me the most was a very significant portion of Palworld players bought Helldivers 2 on release. And that was a crossover that I was very surprised about…I think it's the co-op element, the kind of goofy element, having fun with your friends. I think Steam is really good at driving those big game releases as well. So, it's a perfect storm, really.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever release on the Switch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld's a beefy game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Switch 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buckley: Well, we haven't seen those specs yet, so we're like everyone else, we're waiting. I mean, I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them. If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we were very happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>My big takeaway from your talk is that outside of the existing Palworld community of people who have played and enjoyed the game, you feel that Palworld is extremely misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is your singular takeaway message for people who have not played it and you think misunderstand it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think a lot of people who only know of Palworld from the news and the drama and stuff, in just my opinion, probably completely misunderstand what the game even is. So I would say play it. I mean, I think we should do a demo at some point. Something that I campaign for a lot internally. At some point we should release a demo or some kind of free hour or something if we could figure it out to do it properly. But I think a lot of people who have never played it and only know it from the drama would be surprised if they played it for one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't think it's anything like what they imagine it is. We are nowhere near as seedy and scummy as people seem to think we are. I think it's the double-edged sword. We hid from the public to protect our developers, and at the same time, I think that made us look a bit inaccessible, which makes you look bad inherently. If we'd have been more public, maybe we wouldn't have got that reputation. It's two edges to that, but we have to protect our team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That’s also just the way the internet works. Whatever other things there are to do in Palworld, what’s funny is a meme video of what is effectively distilled down to Pokemon with guns. So that's what everyone's sharing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, I think we're a very nice little company. We've done very well for ourselves with every game we've ever made, and we'll continue, hopefully, to always do well. I think last year was just such a crazy year for games. I think people don't appreciate how crazy last year was. I think people will write about 2024 five years from now. There were just so many unbelievably successful games last year. [Black Myth:] Wukong, Helldivers [2], Palworld, games that just hit numbers that are not normal. So I think emotions were high last year and people got swept away in the fun, maybe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</u></a>. Now, Shawn Layden, who used to run PlayStation in the U.S., has offered his thoughts, pointing to the fear of missing out on Nintendo exclusives as justifying price hikes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/pSu0BQFTFPA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayerDriven YouTube channel and podcast</a>, Layden highlighted the contrasting strategies of Sony and Microsoft, and Nintendo, where Sony and Microsoft are downplaying exclusive games as they move to PC and rival consoles, but Nintendo is keeping its games on its own consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But right here you see, ‘wow, that’s kind of a hefty price hike from Switch 1 to Switch 2 and, wow, 80 bucks for a game?’ " Layden said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if it’s the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 pricing in the U.S.:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden also talked about the price of video games generally, which, he insisted, have actually gone down over the years when you take into account inflation. Layden said console manufacturers should have hiked the price of games by $5 with each new console generation so that they would cost around $90 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was in it at the time — probably every generation they should have baked in a $5 software price hike, and make that the typical, 'well every generation it's another five bucks.' And you would have been up to $90 already by now."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, Trinen insisted Mario Kart World justifies its $80 price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this"><u>some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</u></a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Log into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> at any point over the next week, and you'll unlock a free in-game loading screen showing the game's stock market crashing. 
</p>
<p>
The well-timed stunt comes as economies around the world react to the ever-changing impact of US tarrifs in real time - though the giveaway is primarily designed to highlight the current storyline in Epic Games' battle royale.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's giveaway of The Big Dillbits Crash loading screen is live now, and lasts until next Tuesday, 15th April. Maybe everything will be fine by then.
</p>
<p>
The image shows Fletcher Kane, the villain of Fortnite's current season, reacting in shock as his BitCoin-esque virtual currency suddenly collapses, ruining his financial hold over the Fortnite Island. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/a29d9e01-c7f3-4b0d-8406-cfcb59020faa.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Fortnite had raised some fan eyebrows by introducing the concept of a planet-burning virtual currency, DillBits, to its storyline. In-game, players can obtain DillBits by robbing vaults, and spend them in nearby Black Market stores for exotic weaponary. 
</p>
<p>
At first, DillBits were presented as the source of enormous wealth, and were being championed by fan-favourite character Midas - someone able to create unlimited gold simply by touching something with his bare hands. Why would he need more money, though, players wondered?
</p>
<p>
Now, it turns out that DillBits was a deliberate hustle by Midas and company, designed to ruin Fletcher Kane and end his reign over the Island by suckering him into a BitCoin-like scam. Nice.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite seasons are planned months in advance, and Epic Games likely had this loading screen ready to  launch for some time. But the decision to release it to all players now, specifically, feels like a knowing nod about real-world events as well.
</p>
<p>
Back in the real world, the impact of US tarrifs on the global economy is still being felt, particularly by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">Nintendo fans in both the US and Canada</a> who are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">still waiting for news on when they will be able to pre-order a Switch 2</a> - and how much Nintendo will now charge.

The years pass and the animals perish and the oceans rise and the wealth gap widens and I repeatedly think to myself through a fug of nitrogen oxide, Steam discounts and microplastic sediment, “man, those Oddworld games were excellent, weren’t they”. If you've yet to have the pleasure, you can scoop up the entirety of the squalid anti-capitalist satire universe on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXjw3">Fanatical</a> right now for a pound or dollar.

Released in 1997 for Personable Computers and the PlayableStation, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a> is the story of a Mudokon meat factory worker with his mouth sewn shut who overhears plans to convert the entire workforce into popsicles. It’s a single-screen 2D platformer in which your skills consist of jumping, pulling levers, communicating by means of a once-touted GameSpeak system, farting, and praying.</p>

<p>Oh, how you’ll pray, for you have all the offensive capacity and resilience of a McDonalds salad. Threats include gun-toting Sligs and their miniature T-Rex guard dogs, handsy herds of Paramites, and the viciously territorial Scrabs. The nearest you get to fighting back is possessing the bodies of other creatures and making use of their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Survival rests on manipulating the puzzle-game workings of each screen so as to bypass or isolate dangers, often by the skin of your teeth.  Death is frequent, and gruesomely funny. Abe might be gaming’s ultimate fallguy. Also funny: watching a crowd of Mudokons squeakily tip-toe past a sleeping sentry. Aside from getting the hell out of Rupture Farms, the game calls on you to play a mixture of local messiah and union organiser – commanding and guiding your fellow labourers to mystic portals formed by flocks of birds, while trying not to get them mulched, eaten, blown up, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-exoddus">Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</a> is in some ways a remake, fleshing out the Mudokon communication aspect and turning in a grander plot involving a ghastly new mind-altering soft drink. Mudokons now have emotional states - they'll get angry, wired, depressed or sick, which means you now have to worry about your allies running around giggling or getting into possibly-fatal slapfights. I think Exoddus is the better game than Oddysee, the one they really wanted to make, but they’re both terrific, with tumid, desolate industrial environments made up of pipes and chasms and LED displays.</p>
<p>The later Oddworld games are more of a mixture. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is the standout, a cult Wild Western shooter in which your bullets are squirming critters. Oddworld: Munch's Oddyssey is an imperfect departure into full 3D platforming. I never got round to playing the 2.5D series reboot <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-soulstorm">Oddworld: Soulstorm</a>, but I hear it's a bit ropey.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I need a new Oddworld game right now, but I’d like to play more games that recall this particular blend of gallows humour, apocalyptic gloom and ingenuity. If you’d like to recommend an Oddworld spiritual successor, I’m all ears.

<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-news-on-kingdom-hearts-4-release-date">No News on Kingdom Hearts 4 Release Date</h2>

<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of original first-party Switch games will have the full game on the card rather than requiring a download - though that may not be the case for third-party titles.</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2's reveal last week, there's been some confusion about what exactly will be included on physical game cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Nintendo previously stated the console will support both regular game cards and game-key cards</a>, with the latter being a "key" to downloading the full game.

<p>However, further confusion specifically arose around Switch 2 Edition games and whether the card would include both the original game and the upgrade package.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said: "Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (ie. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code)."</p>
<p>They added: "Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card."</p>
<p>This confirms the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will be complete on the game card. Third-party publishers may still opt for download codes, though.</p>
<p>These Switch 2 Edition games upgrade the originals with new features to make use of the new console's capabilities, be it improved frame rates or camera usage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">They will cost £65 here in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">Kirby and the Forgotten Land will include expanded worlds</a>, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have mouse control support.</p>
<p>No matter what's on the game card, though, don't lick them - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo has confirmed the cards still purposefully taste awful</a> to stop players eating them.</p>
