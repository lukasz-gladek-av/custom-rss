            <p>
Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation, which drew significant acclaim from critics and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">attention from audiences</a> when it was broadcast back in April, has been nominated for 16 Emmy Awards, across categories including Outstanding Drama Series and Best Actor.
</p>
<p>
This year's 76th Emmy Awards, which are hosted by the US Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences to recognise excellence in American primetime television programming, will be held this September. They'll be the second Emmy Awards in 2024, after the last year's ceremony was delayed due to the writers' and actors' strikes.
</p>
<p>
With votes now tallied and nominations <a href="https://www.emmys.com/emmys/nominations-documents">announced</a>, it's clear Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation has made an impression among academy members, garnering 17 nominations across 16 award categories. It's an impressive number but notably still somewhere behind this year's biggest hitters; FX's Shogun leads with 25 nominations, followed by The Bear at 23, Only Murders in the Building with 21, and True Detective: Night Country at 19.

Fallout has, however, been nominated in two of the more high-profile Emmy Awards categories, scoring nominations for Outstanding Drama Series (where it's jostling alongside The Crown, The Gilded Age, The Morning Show, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, Shogun, Slow Horses, and 3 Body Problem) and for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series. Walton Goggins has secured a place in the latter category for his role as The Ghoul, and he's up against Idris Elba in Hijack, Donald Glover in Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, Gary Oldman in Slow Horses, Hiroyuki Sanada in Shogun, and Dominic West in The Crown.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full list of Emmy nominations Amazon's Fallout TV show has amassed, with the winners set to be announced during the 76th Emmy Awards on 15th September:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Outstanding Drama Series</li>
<li>Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series - for Walton Goggins</li>
<li>Outstanding Production Design - for episode The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes - for The End</li>

<li>Outstanding Stunt Performance</li>
<li>Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series - for The End</li>
<li>Outstanding Emerging Media Program - for Fallout: Vault 33</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unsurprisingly given the Fallout TV series' positive reception (which also helped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">bump the ageing Fallout 4 back up the charts</a>), Amazon confirmed the show had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a> back in April. There's no hint as to when Season 2 might air, but its show runners have already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">teased some of the things viewers can look forward to</a> when it eventually arrives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of today's reveal of EA Sports FC 25, we were able to check a remote showcase of all of the game's new features and improvements. I've talked about the 5v5 Rush experience <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a separate article</a>, so I'll focus on everything else here.</p>
<p>It all starts with FC IQ, a comprehensive overhaul of the game's tactics implementation. The developers claim they want players to channel their inner club manager, dictating exactly how their team plays. FC IQ was designed to complement and benefit from previously introduced technologies like HyperMotion V and Play Styles.</p>
<p>It consists of three foundations: Player Roles, the big one which guides how players behave off the ball thanks to over 50 new roles; Team Tactics, which replicates a team's real-world playstyle more closely and provides more variety from match to match; and Smart Tactics, which allows for real-time suggestions based on the current match and even provides commentary on your tactical changes.</p>
<p>EA Sports used real world data provided by Opta and a proprietary AI model to power Player Roles. This model analyzed the Opta data from the last two seasons of each player: all games, stats, and plays. Jude Bellingham's predominant style turned out to be Half-Winger (75%), with 14% as Shadow Striker and 11% as Playmaker. Kai Havertz, on the other hand, has a more balanced style, with 40% as Playmaker, 39% as Shadow Striker, and 21% as Half-Winger.</p>
<p>According to the studio, the result is a more authentic and intelligent movement of your team. At launch, you can expect three to five Player Roles per position (except the goalkeeper). For example, a Wide Midfielder (RM/LM) can be a Winger, a Wide Playmaker, or an Inside Forward. A Full Back (RB/LB) may be a Falseback, a Wingback, or an Attacking Wingback. A Centre-Back (CB) can be a Stopper, Defender, or Ball-Playing Defender. A Defensive Midfielder (CDM) could be a Holding midfielder, a Centre-Half, or a Deep-Lying Playmaker. Striker Player Roles include Advanced Forward, Poacher, Target Forward, and False 9. Lastly, the Centre-Midfielder (CM) has the most options: Box-to-Box, Holding, Deep-Lying Playmaker, Playmaker, or Half-Winger.</p>
<p>On top of Roles, players will be able to select one to three Focuses per Role. For example, when a Playmaker is set to Roaming, it will move around more freely to find spaces. This greatly increases the amount of possible tactic combinations in EA Sports FC 25. By the way, each combination of Player Role and Focus will provide pros and cons. Moreover, EA Sports added Familiarity, which tells you whether a specific player is fit to perform well in any given Player Role.</p>
<p>There's the base role, and then every player has a Role+, which means they are specifically accomplished in something. World-class players also have Role++, which will be a rarity at launch. Finally, a player can also be put out of position, translating into a simplified version of the Role. An example could be placing Vinicius Jr. as a Defensive Midfielder. Familiarity is essentially the new and improved version of the old work rates (which have been removed in EA Sports FC 25).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_PALMER_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Since the community is fond of sharing tactics, the developers have created a new code-based system. It is generated automatically when you save your own tactics. Since it's a universal system, it can be shared across any mode and platform. By the way, the bench size has also been increased to 9 players on Gen 9 platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) in the Kick Off, Career, Seasons, and Tournaments modes. Lastly, they added three assignments for corner kicks: target player (when attacking) and near post/back post players (when defending).</p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 is also getting improvements to HyperMotion V. Whereas last year they only mapped the upper body motions of players, this year the team was able to do full-body mapping on around 1800 players, including 200 women. Goalkeeper playstyles have been massively expanded: the new game includes everything from Deflector to Cross Claimer, Rush Out, Footwork, Far Throw, and Far Reach.</p>
<p>This year, a new core gameplay mechanic called Positional Foul is being introduced. Regular football watchers are very used to it: it's when a player essentially grabs another rugby-style without any chance of getting the ball, with the sole purpose of stopping a dangerous counter-attack. The Positional Foul can be triggered with the right bumper and A or X, depending on whether you play with an Xbox or PlayStation controller. Like in real football, this is an automatic yellow card, but the developers said persisting with this tactic could even result in a red card.</p>
<p>Dribbling has been refined to look more responsive, and the animation database has also been 'cleaned up' to make dribbling feel better than ever. Passing accuracy has been reduced a bit when doing blind passes compared to last year in an attempt to improve realism. Players will also find five new skill moves: toe drag stepover, big feints, stepover ball, heel nutmeg, and drag turn.</p>
<p>Those who plan to play EA Sports FC 25 in single player, offline mode will also get to select the brand new Simulation mode. This is meant to be a slower and more authentic way to play the game. In this mode, weather also affects the pitch, making players slip when it's raining a lot, and the AI opponent will feel more dynamic.</p>
<p>There's been an effort to make stadiums feel more alive through the introduction of authentic mascots, active sideline moments featuring managers, officials, and substitutes, authentic crowd reactions to what's happening on the pitch, and dynamic elements like photographers and cameras following the action.</p>
<p>On consoles, the game will allow users to pick between two graphics modes: Enhanced Visuals or Favor Resolution. The former mode upscales to 4K resolution while adding ray-traced ambient occlusion, cloth simulation on the shirt and shorts, self-shadowing at all times, rim lighting, 3D pitch divots and puddles, and local exposure, while the latter delivers a native 4K presentation as well as cloth simulation on shorts and default exposure. Both still target 60 frames per second to keep optimal responsiveness. Additionally, there's a dynamic time-of-day progression for the first time in the franchise, so you might start a match before sunset and then begin the second half at nighttime.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_JAMES_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The accuracy of player likeness has been further improved with EA Sports Cranium, a new machine learning-based system that will be rolled out to other sports games in the future. While a lot of players have accurate scans, those who don't used to look very generic in past games. After feeding EA Sports Cranium enough photos, though, the results in EA Sports FC 25 definitely improve the likeness of thousands of less famous players.</p>
<p>Career mode also got a significant revamp. The first key feature the team talked about is Live Start Points, which will take up the unfolding seasonal stories from real-life football competitions such as the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and Champions League. An example from last year's season might be Girona being on top of La Liga last Christmas. You'd begin from a Snapshot, a specific moment in time grabbed from the real season, and continue in the game. Inevitably, Live Start Points will be added post-launch.</p>
<p>Career mode has fully integrated FC IQ. Something you could do here is, for example, bring in a coach to ensure Haaland can learn how to play in the False 9 Player Role, which he doesn't have by default in the game. Of course, another option is to recruit a brand new player who's already familiar with that playstyle from the Youth Academy, which has been expanded to include over 90 new countries to scout in. Youths will also be playable throughout the newly added 5v5 Rush tournaments, and managers will have the opportunity to play either with their current or potential stats. Winning these Youth tournaments, which happen every two months in Career mode, will give those players a big stat boost.</p>
<p>Women's football is also fully implemented now in Career mode as part of EA Sports' effort to bring parity with men's football. While most of it works identically, selecting women's football also means adapting to a different financial model with tighter budgets, shorter contracts, different salary structures, and so on. Career mode also optionally offers a more casual experience, stripped of things like transfers and scouting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_JUDExZZ_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the other hand, those who enjoy the transfer market game will be happy to know that EA signed Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano to be in EA Sports FC 25's in-game social media system. Whenever a club signs a major player, you'll get his classic 'Here we go, confirmed' message.</p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 even features the option to go through a Player Career with icons like Pirlo, Van Nistelrooy, Henry, and Kelly Smith (pre-order icons add Ronaldo, Zidane, and Beckham to the mix), the twist clearly being that these legends would have their careers unfolding much later than they did in real football, against and with current players.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developers discussed the changes coming to Ultimate Team. First of all, the mode fully supports Rush, allowing users to bring their own players and even enter matchmaking if they do not have three friends to complete the team. Ultimate Team's Rush is based on Events, which may introduce certain limitations, like club requirements, to which players you can bring in.</p>
<p>Outside of Rush, Ultimate Team in general will enjoy live updates that tie into FC IQ. For example, if a player performs well in a slightly different role than usual for him or her, their Player Role in Ultimate Team will be updated as a result. If you don't want to get too involved in the tactics, you can now just hire real-world manager who will apply their favorite styles to the squad.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_BONMATI_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Everything can be managed via the Web and the companion app, allowing EA Sports FC 25 players to continue theory-crafting out of the game. Moreover, EA listened to three main community requests for Ultimate Team: players will now be allowed to send up to a hundred items to a squad building challenge storage, which is especially useful for duplicates; Evolutions have been expanded to dramatically increase (around seven times) the number of eligible players; the competitive space will see friendlies and rivals matchmaking decoupled, draws awarding one point for rivals, and relegations are being introduced to the top tier.</p>
<p>For Clubs, the developers created a personalized social space called Clubhouse that connects all players. It's essentially a dynamic, customizable locker room that will show up to 11 players at once. The Club manager can also allocate some budget towards Facilities cards, which provide unique attribute boosts that help define your Club's playstyle. There will be 20 to 30 Facilities cards at launch, each coming with one, two, or three-star variant. Moreover, league relegation is back to reintroduce greater stakes. Losing enough matches triggers a one-off relegation match where players will need to avoid losing to stay in their current league.</p>
<p>Crucially, the season pass in EA Sports FC 25 has been unified so that completing matches across all modes will go towards the same goals. Lastly, the player customization tool is deeper than ever before.</p>

<p>We'll need to wait until we get more time with the game, but on paper, it sounds like a bigger evolution than last year. EA Sports FC 25 is out on September 27 (although early access through the Ultimate Edition starts a week in advance) for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="77931a3c-3f80-4855-9ad5-3f76e5fbcb32" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/2024/04/10/the-fallout-tv-show-is-good-season-1-review">us included</a>) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.</p>

<p><em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like <em>Shōgun,&nbsp;</em>which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portrayal of The Ghoul. This is his second Emmy nomination – the first being for Supporting Actor on the show <em>Justified </em>back in 2011.</p>

The individual, unidentified by Sega, will pay unspecified damages to the employee, as well as “delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future.” </p><p>Yeah, we too are dying to know more details, but Sega has made it clear this is all that will be said on the subject. “As this is a case related to a court proceeding,” the company writes, “we ask that you refrain from making any inquiries regarding this matter.” The statement continues (again, via Google Translate):</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We consider slanderous acts against employees, such as announcements of violent acts, threats, and intimidation, to be serious human rights issues that damage the dignity of employees and lead to a deterioration of the work environment. We do not tolerate any harassing behavior, and in order to respect all employees and protect their human rights, we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behavior to be malicious. Please review our Customer Harassment Policy and refrain from any behavior that damages the dignity of employees.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, given the scant information, it’s incredibly hard to know what to think about this. The description given by Sega could be of anything from a series of unpleasant insults, all the way to specific death threats, and while neither is welcome, laws do tend to rule rather differently at either extreme.</p><p>It’d be lovely if everyone could just stop being a colossal asshole on their socials. It would also be splendid if there could be some sort of karmic consequence for those who spend their lives trying to destroy others because they’re scared of girls or what have you. However, it does seem tricky to think the solution is courts granting personally identifying information to corporations, so they can take people’s money in secret. That...doesn’t feel quite right.<br></p><p>Sega makes clear it’s not done, and intends to repeat these actions should others go after their staff, pointing the entire world to its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sega.co.jp/customer_harassment_policy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sega.co.jp/customer_harassment_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Harassment Policy</a></span>, which it appears to believe it can legally enforce on the planet’s population. I love the energy, not so much the method.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, a growing trend saw AAA video game publishers offering early access to new games if you pre-ordered a pricey special edition version. I worried then that if some publishers were successful in locking games behind a ransom fee, many others would do the same in the future. And here we are, in 2024, and most upcoming games have multiple release dates now and it all sucks. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,192712,191487" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While it didn’t <em>technically </em>start last year, in 2023 we saw an increase in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357">number of games offering “early access”</a></span> for a price. <em>Mortal Kombat 1, The Crew: Motorfest, Starfield, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422"><em>Diablo 4</em></a></span>, and a few others all offered players an option: Pay the standard price to play the game at launch or pay extra to play a few days “early,” assuming the servers are working properly. </p><p>To me, it all seemed like an obvious ploy by publishers to milk gamers for even more money than they already do via in-app purchases, cosmetics, battle passes, and XP boosters. I hoped that people would realize that all these publishers were doing was holding back a game’s release for a few days just to make some extra money. I hoped that gamers would see this was a scam and that these early access perks were worthless. </p><p> I was apparently wrong. Looking ahead at the rest of 2024, it’s clear that publishers big and small have seen other games making lots of money via early access launches and are following their lead.</p><p>Here’s a list of games scheduled to release in 2024 that offer early access via a pricier special edition, how much that version costs, and how early you can play:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>College Football 25</em></strong> - 3 days - $90</li><li><strong><em>Madden NFL 25</em></strong> - 3 days - $90</li><li><strong><em>Monster Jam Showdown </em></strong>- 3 days - $70</li><li><strong><em>Star Wars Outlaws </em></strong>- 3 days - $110</li><li><strong><em>Age of Mythology Retold </em></strong>- 7 days - $50</li><li><strong><em>Visions of Mana</em></strong> - 1 day - $80</li><li><strong><em>Space Marine II </em></strong>- 4 days - $100<br></li><li><strong><em>Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream</em></strong> - 3 days - $85</li><li><strong><em>Undisputed </em></strong>- 3 days - $80</li><li><strong><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</em></strong> - 3 days - $100</li><li><strong><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em></strong>- 3 days - $60</li><li><strong><em>Life Is Strange Double Exposure</em></strong> - 14 days (Ch. 1 + 2) - $80</li><li><strong><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></strong>- 3 days - $110</li><li><strong><em>Concord </em></strong>- 3 days - $60</li><li><strong><em>Silent Hill 2</em></strong> - 2 days - $80</li><li><strong><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em></strong> - 1 day - $90</li><li><strong><em>Enotria: The Last Song </em></strong>- 3 days - $60</li><li><strong><em>Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2</em></strong> - 1 day - $75</li><li><strong><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Silver Edition - 2 days - $80</li><li><strong><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown:</em>&nbsp;</strong>Gold Edition - 7 days - $90 </li></ul><p>So this is just our future, huh? I know some might say, “Yeah, so what? I get to play games I like early. That’s cool!” But keep in mind that <em>all </em>of the games listed above aren’t actually being released early. I can’t stress that enough. That’s not what’s happening here. Not at all. </p><p>If a company can release a game like<em> Madden NFL 25 </em>on August 12 for <em>some</em>, they can release it for <em>everyone, </em>instead of making players wait three days because they didn’t spend an extra $20 on some special edition. A game launched on July 10 for some players still had to go through all the same certifications and testing that any other game released on a console is forced to complete. So the only thing holding the game back for three days is greedy publishers.</p><p>Basically, publishers are delaying games by three days for no reason, and then charging you more to play early. They have created a fake problem and are selling you a silly solution.</p><h2 id="h4583"><a id=""></a>Gaming gets more expensive and more confusing</h2><p>Let’s not forget that gaming is one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604">most expensive hobbies in the world</a></span> and now it’s getting even pricier, and some gamers will be locked out from playing a game they bought simply because they couldn’t afford to plop down $30 more for early access. </p><p>In multiplayer games this can lead to people arriving well after others have hit the max level and mastered maps and weapons. And for single-player games, it means folks with less money might have stories spoiled days before they can play. It’s just a real mess of garbage and none of it is necessary at all.<br></p><p> And beyond just how nakedly greedy this all is, it also complicates video games even more than before. We already had to check elaborate pre-order charts to see which version of the game to buy, now some people you know will be playing on a Tuesday while everyone else starts playing on Friday. </p><p>I also want to give a special shout-out to <em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown,</em> which seems to be the first game to take this paid early access shenanigans to the next level with two separate tiers depending on which special edition you pre-order. The silver editions of the game include two days of early access while the even pricier gold edition bumps that up to seven days.</p><p>When I was initially writing up this piece I had included a joke about publishers pushing their luck with multiple early access tiers spread across different and expensive versions. Turns out, that’s not a horrible possible future, but our actual reality. <em>Test Drive Unlimted Solar Crown</em> has three different release dates. Welcome to buying games in 2024. It sucks. </p><p>But whatever, apparently this is our future and I’m not sure I or anyone else can change that now. So let’s watch and see just how many days publishers will lock behind paid early access. At the moment three days seems to be the most popular number, however, others are pushing beyond that. And hell, next year, we might see a game with a 15-day early access period and a <em>separate </em>18-day super early access window. Are you all excited for that future, because I’m not.</p><p><br> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, the boon Family Trade, which granted a boon of higher rarity upon the sacrifice of one you already had, is no longer in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-tips-beginner-start-1851459493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-tips-beginner-start-1851459493"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span>. Instead, it’s been replaced by a brand new boon called Rousing Reception, which allows your cast to cause damage to enemies as they enter an encounter. </p><p>A Daedalus Hammer upgrade to the Sister Blades has also been snuffed from the game, which is a bit of a blow. The upgrade, known as Escalating Ambush, would grant a bonus to the Sister Blades’ Omega Attack after using the technique to successfully kill an enemy. Considering the popularity of Escalating Ambush builds, the upgrade’s removal is definitely hurting fans of the Sister Blades.</p><p>Funnily enough, though, not only did the Sister Blades get a buff to their backstab damage, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769">Chronos’ behavior</a></span> in his boss fight has been adjusted to make it easier to stab him in the back. Before, his sequencing of moves made him a bit of a pain in the ass to get behind, meaning it was difficult, if not impossible, to score backstabs, which enjoy a significant damage multiplier, on him. Now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-phase-2-build-boons-twin-wands-1851504444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-phase-2-build-boons-twin-wands-1851504444">the fucker should go down</a></span> more readily as long as you can sneak up on him.</p><p>Otherwise, there have been some balance changes to encourage more build variety. Of particular note is the Golden Rule boon, which got a nerf of sorts. Golden Rule, which granted a flat damage bonus to your attack and special moves based on how much gold you had, now has a lesser multiplicative damage modifier on all types of damage. In essence, you shouldn’t be able to two-shot bosses based on how wealthy you are anymore.</p><p>Here are the entirety of the latest <em>Hades 2</em> patch notes:</p><h2 id="h33814"><a id=""></a>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sister Blades (Melinoë): increased damage striking foes from behind</li></ul><h2 id="h33815"><a id=""></a>Boons &amp; Blessings</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lightning Lance (Zeus): improved targeting while using gamepad controls</li><li>Spirit Surge (Zeus): reworked; now whenever you use magick, a surrounding foe is struck by lightning</li><li>Sworn Strike (Hera): slightly reduced bonus from Poms of Power</li><li>Engagement Ring (Hera): reworked; inflicts Hitch on foes, and any slain in the circle deal area damage</li><li>Family Trade (Hera): cut from game; replaced with…</li><li>Rousing Reception (Hera): new!

<p>Activision has announced full details of Season 5 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone, and with <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-5-essential-maps-modes-zombies-announcement#WWE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it came confirmation</a> of the WWE collaboration for the game.</p>



<p>Coming to the game as operators are WWE stars Cody Rhodes, Rey Mysterio, and Rhea Ripley. Both Rhodes and Mysterio are available as part of two WWE-themed bundles for the game.</p>



<p>The two bundles are as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Tracer Pack: WWE – Cody Rhodes:</strong> Includes the “American Nightmare” Operator Skin plus two stars and stripes-themed Weapon Blueprints, a Weapon Charm, Weapon Sticker, Large Decal, Loading Screen, and the “Cross Rhodes” Finishing Move.</p>



<p><strong>Tracer Pack: WWE — Rey Mysterio:</strong> Includes “The Ultimate Underdog” Operator Skin plus two red and black Weapon Blueprints and a Weapon Charm, Weapon Sticker, Large Decal, Loading Screen, and the “Mysterio Bulldog” Finishing Move.</p>



<p>It appears as though Ripley will just be a skin to purchase as opposed to a full bundle. She will have two skins to choose from as part of the Season 5 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>More details on the bundles will be available starting July 23.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting a big new Worlds update which treats the space sim's gazillions of planets to a sumptuous overhaul, using technology devised for stablemate fantasy sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which only has one planet, albeit a "literally Earth-sized" one with dragons. Catch a deep dive trailer for the Worlds update below.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The Worlds update introduces water features that boast ripples, foam and reflections, clouds that form and disintegrate in real-time, and weather effects such as rolling fog, rain and blizzards - all of them sculpted by a revised wind system. Skies have more colours, iceworlds boast shinier glaciers, and deserts have more diverse vegetation. They've also gussied up the lighting so that objects, from trees to clouds, cast shadows in relation to the sun's position.

<p>
Sparkling ambient flourishes aside, the update brings new solar ships, aka space sailboats, the possibility of sentient walking houses on weirder planets, and a host of new creatures for the menagerie. "We want to do things that people haven't seen before," explains studio boss Sean Murray in a release, bathetically adding "and of course, these new creatures can all be pets and mounts". The Worlds update also introduces a new Expedition, which features a flamethrower-wielding mech, and is "Starship Troopers inspired" - I suspect it also owes something to the recent popularity of a certain squad-based democracy management game. 
</p>
<p>The update also makes a few improvements to performance. "Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance," explains <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/">the full changelog</a>. "Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory."</p>
<p>There’s a lot more through the jump, including details of new cosmetics and underwater base fixtures, though beware that the patch notes are an absolute landslide of autoplaying videos. My laptop began to hyperventilate when I tried scrolling all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>
"Six months ago we announced Light No Fire," Murray comments in the press release. "It's this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we've learnt new things, and we're feeding that back into No Man's Sky. It feels like we're bringing technology back from the future!" If you'd like to know more about Light No Fire, Hello <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">invited me down to see it a few months back</a>. I personally am a huge fan of the kingfishers.

Lightning Emission works as Bunny moves swiftly through an area, dealing electric damage to enemies and inflicting Electrocute. To a low-level mob, it’s typically enough to one-shot everyone. If you move quickly enough, those Kuiper Shards add up.

<p>EA Sports has released its first trailer along with the reveal of the features coming to EA Sports FC 25 this year.</p>



<p>Returning to the game this year are Manager and Player Career Modes as well as Clubs. New for this year is the long-rumored, now confirmed 5v5 Rush mode. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/features/rush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mode is available</a> within Football Ultimate Team (FUT), Clubs, Kick-Off, and Manager Career.</p>



<p>Also new in EA FC 25 is FC IQ, which EA Sports calls an “overhaul of tactical foundations”.</p>



<p>“An overhaul of tactical foundations across the game delivers greater strategic control and more realistic collective movement at the team level, while a new AI model, powered by real-world data, influences player tactics through all-new Player Roles,” EA Sports says.</p>



<p>Within Career mode, there will be a post-launch update that introduces Live Start Points that allows you to “live out the biggest storylines from the real world”. More details on that will come at a later date.</p>



<p>EA Sports FC 25 releases for everyone on September 27 for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Those who buy the Ultimate Edition of the game will get access starting September 20.</p>



<p>For those wondering, the HyperMotionV technology within EA Sports FC 25 is only available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Those on last-gen consoles and the Nintendo Switch will continue to get the last-gen version of the game.</p>

But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters, called Descendants.</p><p>The grind associated with unlocking Ultimate Descendants without paying money is immense, as players face some extreme drop rates for essential items, but that hasn’t stopped players from giving it a good go. One player, however, has taken the grind to extreme levels, putting in 200 hours over the course of just a few weeks to unlock all the Ultimate Descendants. That is, on average, 14 hours of playtime a day.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1e4r116/every_ultimate_descendant_unlocked_without/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor chicha112</a> showcased their eye-opening achievement with a number of screenshots and an impromptu ‘ask me anything’ of sorts as The First Descendant players reacted in disbelief.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/17/tfd-1721230903759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Chicha112 / reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Chicha112, who plays on PC, explained that they are a veteran of Warframe, a looter shooter from which The First Descendant takes inspiration, as well as Korean MMOs in general (Nexon is a Korean developer). Then it was just a matter of “raw grinding.”</p><p>“There's a lot of questions in the whole thread that I have tried to answer, but honestly when it comes to tips, it just comes down to making sure you're strong enough to tackle the content efficiently and then grinding it out,” Chicha112 said. “No special tricks or super tips to get ahead as far as I know.”</p><p>“A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently,” Chicha112 explained. “I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.”</p><p>“My playtime is 200 hours, I'm pretty sure I have some AFK time because of the maintenance day two and leaving the game on. I'm sure it’s a bit late for others, but a good tip to keep in mind is having a good foundation to grind these characters is very important. Having a strong weapon and a decently built character lowers the farming time by a lot! For example, I used my first energy capacitor and a couple crystallization catalysts on my base non-Ultimate Bunny while I was going through the game very early on to minimize my time spent.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently. I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.</p></div><p>Chicha112 did admit they had to buy character slots (yet another part of The First Descendant that is sold for real-world money) to house the Ultimate Descendants they’d unlocked. “Hoping they add a way to obtain them for free,” they added.</p><p>Some players have recommended Chicha112 now take a break from the game, which it sounds like they intend to do. “I’m all tapped out of sanity,” they said. "Yes it's time to touch some grass."</p><p>What does this tell us about The First Descendant and its grind? Nothing we didn't already know. This is a free-to-play game from Nexon, and so the grind to unlock coveted virtual items for the game's characters was always going to be punishing. But at least now the community knows the true time value of the money they're spending, should they choose to splash out on all the Ultimate Descendants in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Somewhat related, this week <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-asks-players-to-stop-afk-farming-please">Nexon asked The First Descendant community to stop AFK farming</a>, or going AFK during co-op missions, after it became a big problem soon after launch. Nexon was also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>accused of copying Destiny 2 icons</u></a> for the icons used in The First Descendant, something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations"><u>the company has now said it will address in-game</u></a>.</p><p>Last week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does"><u>a significant update for The First Descendant</u></a> that makes some big changes to the game, but leaves some aspects that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review"><u>The First Descendant review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Series director Masayoshi Yokoyama said he'll make that game one day, but it won't be the next title.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>While RGG also develops <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">the Super Monkey Ball series</a> alongside a handful of other more random games, it's inarguably most known for the Like a Dragon series (as Ryu Ga Gotoku literally means Like a Dragon) so the studio drumming up interest already likely points to a more mainline reveal.</p><p>That being said, it has suggested fans will be "surprised" by its next game, essentially meaning anything is possible. Like a Dragon has many offshoots itself, so a ninth (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">technically 10th thanks to prequel Yakuza 0</a>) mainline game isn't the only option.</p><p>RGG has previously referred to spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a> as the "first" Gaiden game, for example, and it could even remake PlayStation Portable and Japanese-only games Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō for modern platforms like it did with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-review">Like a Dragon: Ishin</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It has full spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgement</a> waiting in the wings too, its still action heavy but more murder mystery, detective focused series which hasn't seen a new release since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-judgment-review">Lost Judgement</a> arrived in 2021.</p><p>It could also be something completely new altogether, though even this would seemingly follow a similar template or at least be set in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-casting-audition-finalists-for-new-title-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, a public casting competition for RGG's next game is seeking a "Minato-style girl." Minato is an area of Tokyo but "Minato girl" specifically is slang used to describe a well off young woman.</p><p>Fans will just have to wait and see what the next RGG game is, but thankfully the reveal isn't too far away. The franchise's 20th anniversary takes place in 2025, and as RGG released the beloved Yakuza 0 as a special 10th anniversary project, it may be looking to do something just as grandiose next year.</p><p>Though this seems a particularly quick turnaround for a studio that just released its last mainline (and massive) game earlier in 2024, RGG is known for launching myriad games in a short period of time.</p><p>In the last five years, for example, it's released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgement Remastered, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: 12 games in total.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the latest</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Amazon Games is bringing free-to-play Korean MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a> to the West in September, and we now know all the ways the publisher is changing the game's business model to better fit the expectations of western players.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/tl-business-model" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Throne and Liberty website, Amazon and developer NCSOFT outlined how the game's monetization will differ from the Korean version, explaining its goals, the main currencies players will be interacting with, and detailing how its five-day paid early access period will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTA16Vhgzss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HTA16Vhgzss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For starters, one of Amazon's stated goals is to make combat and power upgrades accessible to all players, not just ones who pay real money to get ahead. To further that mission statement, its in-game store won't sell one of the game's core currencies used to craft and upgrade gear, nor will it sell potions or food that may give players who have them an advantage. Quests and rewards exclusive to the paid battle pass will be removed. An optional subscription seen in the Korean version of the MMO that grants players various benefits, the Blessing of Solisium, won't be available (at least at launch), as Amazon is continuing to "evaluate how this offering needs to change to serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming with the western release of Throne and Liberty include a reduction in price for both its premium battle pass and leveling pass. Both will be purchasable with a currency earnable from in-game activities or selling items on the auction house called Lucent, instead of real-world money. The battle pass has been upgraded too, with additional cosmetics and an improved final reward for those who do decide to purchase the premium version. That aligns with one of Amazon's other stated goals for the game's monetization model: The idea that purchasing items from the shop should feel rewarding but not necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty will offer a Early Access Pack prior to the game's launch that will let owners begin playing five days early, causing concern among some players that those who spend money will gain a noticeable headstart and advantage in Throne and Liberty's PvP-heavy endgame over those who opt to wait. To address those concerns, Amazon announced Throne and Liberty will launch with early access servers. All players who purchase early access will start on those servers, and players who join on the free-to-play launch date will have the option of picking new launch servers or joining an existing early access server should they so choose. Those who purchase early access will not be able to transfer a character from an early access server to a launch server for a period of time to ensure fairness, and the auction houses for early access servers and launch servers will not be connected.</p><p dir="ltr">More details about Throne and Liberty's early access offering will come alongside the game's open beta, which will run from July 18-23. Throne and Liberty is set to release on PC and current generation consoles on September 17 or September 12 for those who purchase early access.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty won't be Amazon's only MMO releasing this year. It's in-house developed New World, originally released in 2021, is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-revamps-the-mmo-for-consoles-with-solo-play-and-more-changes/1100-6524219/" data-ref-id="1100-6524219">rebooted for consoles and PC in the form of New World: Aeternum Edition</a>.</p>
