                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's upcoming 11.2 update is bringing with it one unexpected addition popularized by From Software RPGs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-83346">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>--asynchronous social features.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, Blizzard will add new social functions to Delves, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">MMORPG's latest endgame mode that can be played solo or with small groups</a>. Like in Elden Ring or Dark Souls, players within a Delve will be able to see remnants of other players who have journeyed to the instance, see markers where a player may have died from a strong pack of enemies or hidden trap, and leave helpful messages for others to read while inside. I'm sure these messages will always be 100% serious.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an addition players may not have known they wanted, but one that makes perfect sense and should make Delves feel more alive than they currently do. WoW is a MMO, after all, even as it continues to offer new ways to achieve endgame goals entirely solo. Adding asynchronous social elements to the game's main endgame mode for solo players helps to further reinforce the idea that WoW is a game played alongside millions of other players, even for those players who largely stick to themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders said in an interview with GameSpot it's important that players are able to progress at their own pace in Delves and play with the group size that they want, whether that be solo or with a few friends. The new asynchronous social features in Delves are there to support that flexibility, as Blizzard believes the mode has been a huge success and doesn't want to change what's working.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a way of getting back to some of MMO's roots," Sanders said. "Of knowing that other players are around you, in a way, without necessarily grouping players up with other players they might not want to play with…This is a way of capturing some of that magic of MMOs, of seeing other players throughout the environment, seeing memories of where they may have messed up and gotten splattered by a trap or something, without necessarily impacting what we think has been really positive and successful about the feature."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Delve social features are just the tip of the iceberg for the Ghosts of K'aresh update, which in many ways serves as a sequel of sorts to events and lore first introduced in the game's The Burning Crusade expansion. It will transport players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop a cosmic-level threat from returning. Along the way players will unlock a legendary cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to access new content.</p><p>Blizzard hasn't revealed when the Ghosts of K'aresh update will be going live, but it's expected to be available on WoW's public test realm in the near future. Meanwhile, players are still waiting for more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">WoW's upcoming player housing system</a>, which we said already feels full of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/">endless possibilities based on a recent hands-on preview</a>.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has lifted the veil on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next major update, and it's a surprising sequel to the MMORPG's first expansion, as players journey to the shattered homeworld of the mysterious Ethereals.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, brings to mind the Legion expansion's Shadows of Argus update, which also took players to a destroyed planet that has long existed in the lore. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will travel to the Ethereal former home in an effort to stop the resurrection of Dimensius, a powerful void-lord responsible for the destruction of K'aresh and who players may remember dispatching a fragment of as part of a lengthy quest chain in The Burning Crusade back in 2007. Turns out Dimensius wasn't defeated for good and is back in 11.2 with a major glow-up, sounding and looking far more like a world-destroying entity compared to their <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensius_the_All-Devouring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original oversized voidwalker look</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ethereals, strange energy beings who could be found throughout TBC's continent of Outland, have gone on to be a fan-favorite group within WoW's fantasy universe since their introduction close to two decades ago. More recently in The War Within, the Ethereals have had a larger role to play in the MMO's ongoing story of Xal'atath and her powerful void-infused artifact, the Dark Heart. Speaking with GameSpot, associate art director Tina Wang said the team enjoyed looking back at how the Ethereals have been represented in the past in order to inform the look and feel of Ghosts of K'aresh.</p><p dir="ltr">"We really love the old themes from Burning Crusade, the key Ethereal elements, the mana forges, the Eco-Domes, the glowing pink pipes," Wang said. "I think folks who remember and look back at the Ethereals fondly will see a lot of elements that they really connect with."</p><p dir="ltr">To help navigate K'aresh, players will gain a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Reshii Wraps, that will allow players to "phase dive" into an energy form similar to that of the Ethereals. This lets players see the world through a new lens and will allow access to new activities on K'aresh like Warrants, where players will help track down special enemies for lucrative rewards. The Reshii Wraps will also be used for unique mechanics within the update's new endgame content. One example of using the Reshii Wraps given by lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders is how players in the new raid, Manaforge: Omega, will need to swap to their energy form in order to dodge a giant laser that could wipe out the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000" data-ratio="0.56239870340357" data-width="1851" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000"></a><figcaption>The Reshii Wraps will allow players to phase dive into an energy form to complete new activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another major open-world activity coming as part of the update is called Ecological Succession. Players may remember the large Eco-Domes in TBC's Netherstorm region that helped to define the zone's look, where the Ethereals looked to create new, enclosed ecosystems amidst a backdrop of destruction. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will get to go hands on and help manage their own Eco-Dome by partnering with the Broker Ve'nari, who will ask for players to retrieve plants and animals from older WoW zones to bring back to the Eco-Domes in an effort to kickstart life once more. It's part of the WoW's team's efforts to take advantage of the huge amount of content already within the MMO, Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant lead quest designer Stephanie Yoon said progressing Ecological Succession and its storyline will take multiple weeks. It's a slow burn at first, Yoon said, as ecological change doesn't happen overnight. Over time, however, as players introduce new life and meet new characters, the Eco-Dome will change and the fruits of players' labors will become more obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the end of Ecological Succession, I teared up," Yoon said. "So I hope it impacts players as much as it did me."</p><p dir="ltr">A new zone isn't complete without a new raid and dungeon, and 11.2 will have those too. The Manageforge: Omega raid will see players confronting Dimensius, who Blizzard described as the biggest raid boss in WoW history. How big, exactly? According to Blizzard, the new version of Dimensius is equivalent to the size of Stormwind itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players will be fighting against this void-lord, this being the size of Stormwind city, and they'll see him from different perspectives," Sanders said. "They'll be diving from thousands of feet away against lasers and thrown planets, and they'll also be fighting him up close and personal as he's smashing his fists down on the platform next to you that are the size of a school bus. It's going to be an epic encounter."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002"></a><figcaption>Ghosts of K'aresh's pink Eco-Domes will be a familiar site to those who played The Burning Crusade.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the dungeon front, Eco-Dome Al'dani is a new three-boss instance, one where the dungeon's story will actually take place canonically after the events of the raid and dive into how the Ethereals are looking to sustain life on their home planet. For the more solo-minded players, there's a new Delve as well, one that will actually return adventurers to the Azure Vault in the Dragon Isles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Delves are additionally receiving new souls-like social functions</a> like player ghosts, death markers, and the ability to leave messages for other Delvers to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the update is all about the Ethereals and the Brokers, the Shadowlands mega-dungeon Tazavesh, the Veiled Market will return for The War Within Season 3's Mythic+ dungeon pool, split into two instances. Tazavesh will be joined by the new Eco-Dome Al'dani as well as Halls of Atonement from Shadowlands and four War Within instances. On the PvP side of the season, K'aresh itself will have a specific PvP zone, Vanquisher's Wake, earmarked for open-world PvP where players will be able to complete their weekly spark quest to earn rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't yet revealed when WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will release, but it will likely be available for testing on the game's public test realm in the near future. As for what else is coming to WoW in 2025, Blizzard previously announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">Legion Remix event for later in the year</a>, and players are hoping to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's player housing system</a> as well. In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">WoW player housing hands-on preview</a>, we said even in their currently early form, the possibilities offered by the game's housing decoration tools already feel endless.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Switch is many things, but a serious fighting game platform is not one of them. That’s not to say there aren’t amazing fighting game experiences, as proven by the existence of titles like the Capcom Fighting Collection series, and there have been regular ports of premier fighting titles like Mortal Kombat, albeit vastly downscaled to fit them on there. Outside of Super Smash Brothers, though, Switches are not regularly seen at fighting game tournaments. Heck, there are barely any high-quality fight sticks for the system, relying instead on adaptors to make things compatible.</p>
<p>That all looks like it’s about to change though, with the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2, and Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition as a launch title. Not only is this the full Street Fighter 6 experience, it’s also rated as tournament legal by Capcom, making this portable version of the game a genuine challenger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2gsKAoW0sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you’ve spent time with Street Fighter 6, you’ll already know that this sits handily amongst the current crop of best fighting games. It rewrote the pervading negative narrative that circled Street Fighter V, as well as introducing a host of new features to the series which now feel essential. It is a great game, and two years down the line, with the second batch of fighters having just dropped, it’s hit a new peak.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version then immediately sets the tone by including all the previously released fighters, taking the roster to an exceedingly healthy 26 fighters. Besides that, it also benefits from two years’ worth of updates and content drops, and, if anything, loading up Street Fighter 6 at launch on Switch 2 is daunting, giving you so many possibilities, and so many characters to choose from, that it’s hard to know where to start.</p>


<p>The best starting point for most people will be World Tour. Here, you create your own fighter, designing them from the ground up, and then taking them out into the semi open-world to find fame and fortune by running up to people in the street and getting into a brawl with them. For all that it occasionally feels wrong beating up an unassuming old lady, this mode lets you craft and create a unique fighter, building up their personal repertoire of moves by training under each of the established fighters from the series, and it’s just a brilliant twist on the established Street Fighter one-on-one mechanics.</p>
<p>Some may wish it was more like Netherealms’ cinematic singleplayer stories like those found in Mortal Kombat or Injustice 2, rather than a Yakuza-lite brawler, but I love the player agency you have in World Tour, and there’s some serious longevity and customisation for your playable avatar to keep you coming back.</p>

<p>However, in docked mode, the Switch 2 version of the game doesn’t perform as well as the PlayStation 5 or PC editions here, with the open world and emergent battles proving pretty challenging for Nintendo’s new handheld. The frame rate takes significant hits while you’re running around, and that’s with vastly reduced animations on distant figures, or more often than not, characters just popping into existence much closer than you’d expect.</p>
<p>That, combined with the 30fps fights in this mode, take the shine off what is one of the biggest draws of this game. Surprisingly, things are better in hanheld mode, with a reduced resolution helping to keep things smoother, if not perfect. Even so, it’s still a hell of a lot of fun – I’ve spent the entire day today running around in it – and if you don’t have access to the other versions, you likely won’t mind too much.</p>

<p>The Battle Hub is Street Fighter 6’s online component. The twist here is that it’s one giant lobby that you explore in 3D, running up to potential opponents playing at arcade machines, while also being able to watch fights, customise your avatar and more. The Switch 2 version is fully crossplay compatible with the other versions of the game, but that’s a bit of a blessing and a swift kick of a curse. The combination of reduced access to competitive Fight Sticks and Nintendo resolutely steering away from an actual D-pad on the Joy Con 2, make this far from an even playing field, even if the bouts themselves are fundamentally mechnically the same.</p>
<p>You can choose to disable crossplay if you want your online fighting to be limited to Switch 2 players, but then you’re severely limiting your potential opponents. When playing with Joy-Con 2, you can opt for Street Fighter 6’s Modern Controls which make things more accessible, giving players access to set combos with a simplified button layout, but fighting game fans and long-time players will want the full-fat experience. That is here, and the new Pro Controller 2 has a better, more defined D-pad than its predecessor, but there’s a number of ifs, buts and maybes to actually interacting with this game.</p>

<p>Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition is, in and of itself, an awesome port of the original. It’s attractive, with clear, sharp visuals, and the mainline battles are brought to you in smooth 60fps. Performance is choppier during the World Tour mode, with 30fps combat feeling decidedly less polished than those elsewhere, and hanging out in the Battle Hub can bring the odd judder or two. Crucially, there’s no sign of that during online battles, or in the game’s traditional offline modes like Arcade and Vs, but there are signs of where Capcom has had to make cuts to bring it to the less powerful Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6: Year 1+2 Fighters Edition is an impressive port, but it almost feels like its for the wrong hardware. As the system matures, and as third party providers give us Joy-Con 2 with better D-Pads, and maybe Hori, Turtle Beach or Qanba bless us with a new fight stick or two, perhaps that feeling will change. In the here and now, I don’t expect to see many Switch 2 players making it to Evo or the Pro Tour, but they’ll definitely be having fun in the meantime.</p>

			<p>EA has narrowed the release window for Skate's early access launch, which is now due to arrive sometime in summer 2025. The company also <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">showcased</a> the next major update that'll be arriving for players who are already taking to the streets of San Vansterdam, which will provide a whole new look to the city compared to the one players have had in the playtest so far.</p>
<p>Update 0.27.0 arrives on July 2, 2025, and adds a great deal of detail to the city and environments that players will skate through. It also includes more than 140 new challenges for players to test their skills and new character customization features for players to really start expressing themselves in this new Skate, even in the insider playtest.</p>
<p>All of which is shown in the video below, through a few small clips of gameplay from the insider playtest, with players skating around the new San Vansterdam with the 0.27 update live.</p>
<p><iframe title="July Playtest Gameplay Preview | skate." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CA3z4t8iMRU?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you've not yet signed up for the playtest and want to try the game before it launches in early access sometime this summer, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">make sure to sign up</a> before <strong>June 27, 2025</strong>, as registrations for the playtest will be closed after that date.</p>
<p>The before-and-after photos shared by EA, showing how the playtest will change, in environmental detail alone, are another example of just how close we're getting to the game's launch, with players finally no longer skating in mostly grey environments.</p>

<p>EA also confirmed that Skate can be wish-listed on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, so players keen on jumping into the new game can be notified when pre-orders go live.</p>
<p>We're so close to the return of the Skate series, an event that many players and fans of the original trilogy didn't think would happen. It'll be interesting to see how the full game resonates with players, and how EA and Full Circle continue to respond to player feedback as the early access period goes on, which, as of now, doesn't seem like it'll be that long, if the full game is still due out by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">April 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>If you're reading this, it may be too late. The mysterious genius behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s most popular flying car mod has just released its first update in a good while, alongside a fresh work that removes the speed limits the game applies to all of its vehicles.</p>
<p>It looks like the perfect recipe for my next trip to Night City ending with an shattered engine block wedged halfway up a skyscraper, and Keanny Reevhand standing next to it tutting.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=description">Let There Be Flight</a> by modder Jack Humbert, it arrived in September 2022, swapped the wheels of Cyberpunk's cars for working thrusters, and left plenty of folks wondering why dystopian futures are ever allowed to omit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O7qff_ezFE">flying cars</a>. After all, when the world's gone down the corporate tubes, surely you need to balance that out by letting people dream of drifting a futuristic VW golf ten thousand feet above the pavement?</p>
<p>I digress. Humbert's just updated Let There Be Flight for the first time since <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=logs">June 2023</a>, which is welcome news since folks have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk2077mods/comments/1lc5xj5/let_there_be_flight_back_2025/">reported issues</a> getting it to run with the game's more recent patches.</p>
<p>"I've been rewriting some parts of LTBF to better use in-game systems, and this has allowed for better state control of flight and input contexts, enabling native vehicle combat (handheld and vehicle-mounted) while flying," he wrote, "This should also make it more compatible with other vehicle-based mods (in theory), but I have yet to try things out on a wide scale...I have lots of ideas that I'd like to see implemented, and will try to get them finished to a point that you can at least try them out here."</p>
<p>Nice, but here's the kicker, alongside this update Humbert's uploaded his first new mod since 2022. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=description">Vehicle Speed Unlimiter</a> and gets rid of the automatic limits the game puts on car movement speed - as far as I can tell, the ones you'd bang your head against even if you modded or file tweaked a car to go beyond its base top speed value.</p>
<p>The mod's description says speeds above 400mph will be possible, and to make clear what that's done, a user with the handle Oranje3 has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=15695671">said</a> they've already used it to get a modded car up to 1222mph, and posted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=images#lg=3&amp;slide=0">a screenshot</a> to back that assertion up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I now have a new mission in life. I'll have to find the time to get my Cyberpunk load order back to working order since I've not done a playthrough in a little bit, but if I do soon, I'll definitely be trying to better that speed. In a flying car too, assuming that doesn't prove a barrier to engaging warp speed.</p>
<p>If you want to try Vehicle Speed Unlimiter, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, while Let There Be Flight requires that plus <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4575">Input Loader</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">Redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how to make it happen.</p><h2 id="h29649"><a id=""></a>How to set a passcode on your Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>When you’re ready to set a passcode on your Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll first need to boot up the console. I mean, that should be pretty obvious. Hurry up. I want to get back to playing <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>Click the “Settings” icon on your Nintendo Switch 2 home screen, then scroll down and select “System”. Next, scroll through the options until you reach a setting that says “System Lock”. Click this setting to be introduced to a screen where you can create a 4-8 digit passcode.</p><p>The default method of input is using the joysticks for some reason, but you can hold the “+” button down to switch to a keypad layout if you’d prefer. I’d recommend doing so, as entering the numbers with the joystick can be kind of finicky. </p><figure id="" data-id="bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-recommend-id="image://bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-recommend-id="image://bc66c08f28a7061a971d3be93d8e9adc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A setting in the Switch 2's system menus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Either way, once you’ve entered the passcode and confirmed it, accessing your Nintendo Switch 2 from Sleep Mode will always require you to unlock it first. Now your kids can’t get on there and overwrite your save files and max out your credit cards buying <em>Fortnite</em> skins — or whatever kids do these days.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-recommend-id="image://9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-recommend-id="image://9ecf3e8ea8d958abe549bb8fe67d3c82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The lock screen for the Switch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you ever want to remove the passcode, return to the “System Lock” setting and toggle it off. You’ll have to enter the passcode to turn the feature off, though. If you’ve forgotten the passcode, you can press “+” to sign into your Nintendo Account to unlock the system instead. </p><p>Oh, and don’t forget you should share the code with any other adults you feel comfortable using your console — but don’t give it to strangers. You know better than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><h3 id="Two_new_weapons">Two new weapons</h3><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded adds two new weapons to Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision announced the Olympia, a double-barrel shotgun, and the pickaxe melee weapon will arrive sometime during this midseason update.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092"></a><figcaption>Pickaxe melee weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Two_new_events">Two new events</h3><p dir="ltr">Each seasonal update usually includes a few events. So far, the only ones confirmed for Season 4 Reloaded are two community-based Zombies events. These are vaguely described by Activision, so it's not yet clear how these event or reward systems work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>King of the Dead</strong> runs from June 26 to July 3. For this, players must eliminate zombies in any Zombie mode to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Master of Grief</strong> runs from July 10-17. This event is described as collecting Essence in Grief in order to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h3><h4 id="More_multiplayer_maps">More multiplayer maps</h4><p dir="ltr">For Black Ops 6 multiplayer, the Season 4 Reloaded adds two more maps: A brand-new map called Eclipse and a remaster of Fringe from Black Ops 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103"></a><figcaption>Eclipse multiplayer map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision recently confirmed that next season will bring the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final Zombies map for Black Ops 6</a>. This means players won't get a new map for the midseason update, but there will be new limited-time modes for Zombies.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="New_Zombies_LTMs">New Zombies LTMs</h4><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Starting Room LTM</strong> is inspired by the starting room of the classic Moon map from Black Ops 1, where players are limited to only a small section of the map. This mode will be available on all Black Ops 6 maps, with each one giving a limited area for players to survive as long as they can.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Abomination Challenge LTM</strong> is vaguely described by Activision as taking place on "a warped version of Liberty Falls" and players must hunt down and eliminate an ultra-powered-up Abomination.</p><p dir="ltr">Grief mode launched at the start of Season 4, and Treyarch confirmed the mode is permanent. The latest patch notes for Black Ops 6 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-improves-grief-mode-and-returns-disabled-skin/1100-6532410/">several improvements to Grief</a>, and the developer revealed more updates are currently in testing, so it's likely Season 4 Reloaded could include even more quality-of-life changes the mode.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h3><h4 id="More_Ranked_Play">More Ranked Play</h4><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded returns Resurgence Ranked Play to Rebirth Island. The competitive mode will exist alongside Ranked Play on Verdansk and feature a separate ranking system and rewards, so players can progress through both ladders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185"></a><figcaption>Resurgence Ranked Play on Rebirth Island</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to sweaty Ranked Play modes, Season 4 Reloaded includes the Havoc Royale LTM and Resurgence Casual.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Additional_game_modes">Additional game modes</h4><p dir="ltr">The Havoc Royale limited-time mode is described as chaotic 15-minute matches with 44 players on a limited section of Verdansk. Each circle collapse will include a different game modifier to affect the match, and players will need to adapt fast to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">With the success of casual BR modes on Verdansk, Season 4 Reloaded adds the Resurgence Casual mode, bringing bots to Rebirth Island. This mode will still follow the normal Resurgence gameplay, but the lobby is made up of a mix of real players and bots.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The publisher has also confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/" data-ref-id="1100-6532517">Black Ops 7 is a boots-on-the-ground game</a>, squashing the rumors of potential jetpack or wall-running mechanics.</p>

            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> patch has removed the ability to damage other players in PvP by ramming them with your vehicle, killing the popular PvP tactic.</p>
<p>Tactic is perhaps too strong a word. Hordes of players in Dune: Awakening's Deep Desert end game zone were tracking solos down in orniphopters. If they found them in an orniphopter of their own, they'd shoot them down with missiles.</p>
<p>The real problem emerged if they were on foot. Prior to the patch, if you were hit by a orniphopter you'd be knocked down into a revive state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">These pilots then waited for you to self-revive, then crushed you again</a>, leading to a loop of roadkillification.</p>

<p>This trend didn't go down particularly well, with creative director Joel Bylos popping onto Reddit to say the team were working on a fix. This appears to be that fix, and it's going down well among the community. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/myggtgi/?context=3">Ciyeelo on Reddit</a> responded with: "Thank fucking god because so-called beta testers Guild with 🤓 10k hours of game play was abusing this Day 3 of the early release."</p>
<p>Others still desired additional changes. A popular sentiment is that the vehicles themselves should take damage when taking major bumps. As Illustrious-Hawk-898 puts it: "Being able to ride a buggy off the rim of the Hagga Rift to the bottom, and not taking damage; or flying a thopter into a wall at 160km are some of the most immersion breaking aspects of this game".</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future of Dune: Awakening? Well, big groups of orniphopter gangs will likely still remain a powerful threat. Even if they can't ram you, five of them rushing you all at once is a little insurmountable. However this change should allow players to line up shots with Lasguns and Rocket Launchers a little easier, especially once more players get their hands on the tier six materials required to create them.</p>
<p>These twists and turns are to be expected in a large PvP setting like the one present in Dune: Awakening's end game. If it sounds like something you're interested in, why not check out Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>! It covers the end game, describing it as a "weekly political boxing match that I've found endlessly captivating".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This comes with the game itself along with "five in-game wearable masks, five slingshot skins with special trail VFX, a Concept Art Viewer, and a 3D Model Viewer featuring in-game characters, monsters and more".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The debut trailer doesn't look <em>terrible</em> (though it doesn't look amazing, either), but then we clocked who's actually publishing this thing: GameMill Entertainment. You know, the team behind travesties such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/skull_island_rise_of_kong">Skull Island: Rise of Kong</a>. It's not a team known for its high quality, let's put it that way.</p>
<p>Still, we'll reserve judgement for now. Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- SURVIVE AN ORIGINAL GOOSEBUMPS STORY</strong> – Experience a brand-new Goosebumps mystery, crafted exclusively for the game. Encounter fresh terrors inspired by the book series while uncovering the supernatural secrets hidden within Little Creek.</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPLORE THE HORRIFYING UNKNOWN</strong> – Traverse fog-filled streets, creep around abandoned theaters, and sneak through dark libraries teeming with mystery. Every shadow hides a new spooky surprise waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>- <strong>FACE MYSTERIOUS CHALLENGES</strong> – Test your wits with mind-bending puzzles, interactive contraptions, and clever riddles that stand between you and the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>- <strong>STAY AHEAD OF DANGER</strong> – Use stealth and cunning to evade a dreadful menagerie of monsters inspired by classic Goosebumps frights, reimagined for an all-new monster-filled experience. Or fight back with your trusty slingshot!</p>
<p>- <strong>EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE ENDINGS</strong> – Your choices shape the fate of Sloane and her friends. Can you unearth the full truth behind Little Creek’s horrors, or will the town’s mysteries consume you?</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles story script will be significantly bigger than the script of the original PlayStation version in terms of characters, the game's director confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://publish.twitter.com/?url=https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1935191460619718669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, director Yasumi Matsuno revealed that, in terms of characters, the Japanese script of the remaster is estimated to be around 60% bigger than the original script. Matsuno-san added that this figure does not include system-related text, chanting text, brave stories, sound novels, or cutscenes. In terms of actual text, Matsuno-san said that it is difficult to compare the total between the new and old versions, but if the increased characters are of any indication, the script has been significantly expanded over the original.</p>
<p>In terms of new content over the original PlayStation version, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles won't feature much besides additional character conversations meant to enhance the story and characters. In a new interview shared by Square Enix on its <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">official website</a>, director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed that the additional content added to the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile ports are based, won't be included, as the team wanted to recreate the original faithfully. Maehiro-san also revealed that one of the biggest challenges in developing the remaster was doing so without the original game's source code, which had been lost, which is not uncommon for older games. As such, the team analyzed various existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming, and even worked things out by feel alone by playing the game.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">September 30th.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-gen-xbox-hardware-wont-be-tied-to-one-store-or-one-device.1222164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has given us a small sneak preview into the next generation of its hardware, and it sounds as though the multi-device, multi-storefront approach will continue across the next few years, at least.</p>

<p>In a new video, Xbox president Sarah Bond discusses what's next for Xbox and its hardware, and while it sounds like there will be new consoles from the company, they're going to look pretty different from what we're used to.</p>

<p>Bond says that Xbox has formed a "multi-year partnership" with AMD to create chips for its new devices, including "next-generation Xbox consoles". Said machines will also include backwards compatibility with previous-gen Xbox games, by the sound of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pm9HxZPJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pB-fTji8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is teaming up with AMD for the next generation of its consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bond, this is all in service of building a platform that allows you to play games that aren't constrained to a single device or a single store ecosystem.</p>

<p>While we don't know exactly what that means, it sounds as though next-gen Xbox devices will allow you to access stores outside of the Microsoft Store. That could mean PC stores like Steam, GOG, or the Epic Store become accessible on Xbox devices, which would give console gamers a much broader spectrum of games to play.</p>

<p>In closing, Bond says the Xbox team is working closely with the Windows folks to ensure that "Windows is the number one platform for gaming". It's arguably telling that she says "Windows" rather than "Xbox"; that could imply that next-gen Xbox hardware will run on the Windows platform rather than a bespoke ecosystem for consoles.</p>




<p>In recent years, Xbox has been moving away from its own exclusive ecosystem in favor of releasing its games on other platforms; titles like&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><i>Gears of War Reloaded</i></a>, all of which either were or would have been Xbox exclusives, have been released on other platforms.</p>

<p>It's fair to say Xbox has roundly lost the latest "console wars", if such things are still ongoing (which Xbox would like you to believe they aren't); if last year's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-series-xs-sales-are-reportedly-less-than-half-of-the-ps5s-with-microsoft-on-track-for-a-repeat-of-ps4-vs-xbox-one/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales figures</a> are to be believed, then the Xbox Series X|S range is selling much worse than the PS5, which is probably why Bond and her company want to get out of the exclusive business.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still probably a good few years away from next-generation Xbox hardware, so we're probably going to have to wait a while to discover what the company's vision for its new direction is. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>TallBoys and Critical Reflex have announced an open public playtest for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/militsioner">Militsioner</a>, the immersive sim in which you try to escape a town that swelters in the shadow of an extremely large, temperamental policeman. It would be nice to think the premise has gotten less relevant since we first covered the game in 2021, but I suspect that if you are currently living in, say, Los Angeles, you will find much to relate to. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest has yet to kick off, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041689326?l=english">sign up already on Steam</a>. It'll run for two weeks, and will contain "a fraction of the game with most of the mechanics", which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>- Lonely and needy giant with his wishes, attachments and emotions. Learn how to keep his mood in check or to hide when things go south.</p>
<p>- The town's district, packed with a variety of NPCs, items and secrets. All is systematic, interactable and changing based on the time of day</p>
<p>- Flood creeping in from below - when the giant feels bad, the whole town is submerged in water.</p>
<p>- Gifts to build relationships - most items can be gifted, resulting in unique reactions and outcomes.</p>
<p>- Stealth to hide from the giant's wrath - avoid the light and choose the right time to go for illegal options.</p>
<p>- Evading the giant's hand - hide under awnings and pipelines and wait for the right moment to run for it. The hand might not get everywhere, but it's faster than it looks.</p>
<p>- Complete player freedom. Almost every problem has multiple solutions. There are no wrong ways to play the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>The devs caution that this is a test build and as such, subject to change. In particular, you may notice some missing textures. If you're wondering how Militsioner has come along since we covered it last, they also posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041690500?l=english">progress report</a> earlier this month. Amongst other recent changes, the giant now has an inventory (meaning you can pick his titanic pockets) and the ability to take a day off, which improves his mood and may cause new routes to appear. Townsfolk will now report you for breaking and entering, but you can also persuade them to be your alibi if you're under suspicion.</p>
<p>I've been coming and going with imsims, lately. I think the genre needs some kind of shot in the arm. Perhaps by "shot in the arm" I really mean "King Kopper". If you are similarly enthused, please check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-devs-of-surreal-escape-sim-militsioner-explain-how-theyve-shrunk-their-giant-ambition">our interview from 2014</a> for more on what TallBoys are cheekily calling an Orwellian "dating sim", inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Hitman.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ataris-classic-adventure-is-back-as-adventure-of-samsara-and-its-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I really admire the retro throwbacks Atari is doing these days, whether it’s something like Wayforward’s utterly gorgeous and charming Yars Rising or the underrated Lunar Lander Beyond. These games imagine the world around the Atari originals that inspired them, using them to build a base for a new game while celebrating what came before. It’s a neat idea, and something I wish other publishers would learn from. Needless to say, when I got an invite to sit down with their latest retro revival, I took it, even if I didn’t know what it was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I got was Adventure of Samsara, a new take on the Atari classic Adventure on the Atari 2600. Adventure was before my time, but it’s remarkable to go back to because of how simple it is. That doesn’t mean it’s not interesting, though. Seriously, go look up a playthrough of Adventure if you’re unfamiliar; it’s amazing what you can convey with very simple graphics and a little imagination on the part of the player. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Adventure of Samsara Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not what Adventure of Samsara is, though. This game is stunning, with simple yet evocative pixel art that is some of the most visually striking I’ve ever seen; I didn’t appreciate how much it captured the visual vibe of the original game until after I went back and saw it, but once you’ve seen them both, it’s easy to see how Adventure of Samsara understands its visual roots. My demo started with a beam of light striking a planet, resurrecting a fallen hero, and covering him in golden armor. The first thing I had to do was help a guy named Ombro out of a cage. “But Will,” you might be wondering, “how do you translate a game like Adventure into the modern era?” Well, dear reader, I’m glad you asked. The answer, of course, is that you make it a metroidvania with soulslike elements (resting at golden anvils restores your healing flasks and respawns enemies). I know, I know, but hear me out. This actually works pretty well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This game is stunning, with simple yet evocative pixel art that is some of the most visually striking I’ve ever seen.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">See, the original Adventure was about navigating a world and finding the way forward, whether that meant solving a maze, finding a key to open a locked door, or bringing the right thing to the right place. There was a good deal of backtracking and learning how to navigate your environment. Sounds like a metroidvania, right? Well, 45 years later, here we are.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I had to get my guy Ombro out of his cage, but I didn’t have a sword. So I went into a shining room behind me (Ombro was basically like, “Hey, check out that room back there”), grabbed a sword and shield, and came back. And in between, I got my first taste of Adventure of Samsara’s combat. I wouldn’t call it slow, but it is deliberate. Moving, jumping, dodging, and swinging your sword are weighty experiences, and once you commit to an action, you’re going to be stuck doing it until you finish. When you’re in combat, you want to make sure you’re doing the right thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure of Samsara also has a parry, but again, this animation is pretty long, so if you attempt a parry at the wrong time, you’re going to get hit. Get it right, though, and you’ll be treated to one of the most satisfying parries you’ve ever seen, as the Solar Champion (that’s you) uses their sword to knock your opponent back before bringing your own sword down in a giant arc that deals massive damage to stronger foes and kills your basic mooks in one shot. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/d-1750204828984.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I’d used my fancy new sword to bust Ombro out, he told me that our people, the Orphics, were under attack by Necromancers. No biggie, just a regular Tuesday. Sounds like a Solar Champion problem, so I set out for the nearby village.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, this is where I spent most of my time with Adventures of Samarar’s demo. Aside from the combat, which kept me on my toes because of how deliberate each choice was, I was mostly jumping from ledge to ledge (holding on is something you can do manually, which allows you to do some more complex platforming), finding new ways to get to places, and discovering hidden secrets, such as Data Cubes (think pixely murals) that referenced the original Adventure. At one point, I had to help Potisto, the Orphic Crypt Keeper, who was also in a cage (noticing a pattern here?) get a Spoiled Elixir, which meant finding it in a nearby chest. Once I did, he gave me a key to the next area.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was mostly jumping from ledge to ledge, finding new ways to get to places, and discovering hidden secrets.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after that, I fought my first boss. The Fleshless Giant was a good test because I couldn’t just rely on my parry to beat him. I could parry two of his three attacks (the third was a magic spell I had to avoid), but only parrying one of those actually did damage. Parrying the other let me avoid damage, but knocked me backwards. The trick was finding spacing where I could avoid that attack and set myself up to parry the other one. It wasn’t a complicated fight, but finding the right spacing felt good. And better yet, I didn’t have to play it that way. I could have just dodged and whacked away at him. I just wanted to try it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/f-1750204845103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the big fella went down, I got to get down to the whole “finding the Orphic Village” thing, so I went exploring. I found an ability that let me manipulate a ball of fire to light hi-tech torches (that’s one of the fun things about Adventure of Samsara; you wield a sword, but there are automated metal doors and elevators scattered around) and burn away overgrown plants. I got spells that let me push enemies away and teleport back to the last golden anvil I used. And I ran into more enemies. Spiders that ran into me instead of attacking, so I couldn’t parry them! Flying dudes I had to jump to deal with! These really annoying ground worm things that spat poison! No matter what new thing I got, I had to stay on my toes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did eventually find the Orphic Village, and met more Orphics. I only saw an early segment, but I did come to appreciate Adventure of Samsara’s writing as I played it. Each character speaks with a unique voice, and you’d never mistake one of them for the others. Whether I was learning about the Orphic’s sacred tree that I could help nourish to upgrade my flasks (I see you, video game mechanics), learning about the Blacksmith’s lost friend, or just getting the key to the next area, exploring the town was interesting. Other Orphics even made jokes about how I was the strong, silent type. It’s just nice when people really <em>see you</em>, you know?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/c-1750204875606.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe the most interesting thing in my demo happened at the end. After I left the village, I ran into what appeared to be an astronaut with a jetpack fighting a dragon that looked suspiciously like one of the ones from Adventure, just… you know, way more detailed. I got a couple of hits in to help out, but we didn’t get him. He vanished, and the jetpack astronaut warned me that he (and the dragon) was from another world. They weren’t supposed to be here. I needed to be wary of ambushes. My demo ended shortly thereafter, but I had no shortage of questions, and that’s where you want to be when a preview wraps up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing a 45-year-old game into the present era is a challenge. I’ve just scratched the surface of what Adventure of Samsara has to offer, but it feels like it’s doing a good job of staying true to Adventure while guiding it into a new era. I knew nothing about it going in, but I came out fascinated by both the original game and this spiritual successor (and if this sounds cool to you, there is a demo on Steam right now). But that’s the magic trick of a game like this, right? You’re always torn between the present and the future, balancing what you’re seeing with what comes next, wondering what's around the next corner. The only thing left to do now is see if developer Ilex Games and Atari can hold onto that feeling for an entire adventure.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The group gets together upon discovering that a museum is hiding their ownership of multiple antiques in a vault, not even providing a reasoning of public education, but opening them up to having nowhere to report a theft. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Relooted Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ironically, this idea started when my mother visited the British Museum,” states Nyamakop Creative Director Ben Myres. “We met up later and she was wild with rage talking about this one element where the whole front of a temple from the south of Turkey was literally moved to the museum. She said, ‘You should make this into a game.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers wanted to ensure that Relooted uses only real-world examples of items countries have been trying to reclaim.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Myres thought about the mechanics of stealing a building from a museum and work on Relooted began.

In theory, the hacker locksmith should go where you suspect a security door will close, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are indeed wrong choices, but there could also be off-the-wall decisions that may facilitate the retreat in ways not explicitly intended.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If the player put items under the shutters prior to the escape, there should still be a gap to free-run under them when it's time to get out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the player grabs one of the artifacts, the alarm goes off and the escape begins, surfacing a timer in which you can get the other items and get to the getaway vehicle at the far end of the stage. Here is where all your planning comes to fruition; if the player put items under the shutters, there should still be a gap to free-run under them. That is, of course, assuming you placed items that your character can move through. A safe is a big, bulky item but it does not do much good if it is still closed and locked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The level ends as the player makes their way into the van, with promises of many more capers to come. The story promises to expand with not only interesting new heists, but BioWare-style choices along the way to shape the story. I came away from Relooted feeling like it is one of the freshest, most interesting games at Summer Games Fest and I cannot wait to play the full title.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-sets-its-sights-on-reclaiming-the-looter-shooter-throne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With action-packed gunplay, an innumerable quantity of badass guns to loot, and some of the most crass humor in gaming, the Borderlands games have held a special place in my heart since way back in 2009. But it’s also a series that practically invented the looter shooter genre, then saw itself fall behind the curve as a renaissance of RPG-infused multiplayer shooters dominated the space. With Borderlands 4, the team at Gearbox seems eager to take some big swings in hopes of reclaiming the throne of firearms and shell casings they themselves built, and whether it’s the greatly improved shooting mechanics, an interesting revamp to RPG mechanics, an entirely fresh setting, a slew of new characters, or a more grounded tone in its story, the handful of hours I played left me fairly confident that I will find myself pulled back into this wonderfully weird world of psychopaths and extremely irritating robots.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>I Need Guns</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a whole heck of a lot of novel things Borderlands 4 tries, but the first thing that immediately jumped out at me was the focus on movement. I counted no fewer than <em>five </em>additional ways to keep your vault hunter in motion while hunting for treasure and blasting wild animals, including double jumping, gliding through the air, dashing from side to side, pulling yourself around with a grappling hook, and even swimming – which is especially great, because dying every time one of my toes got wet was always pretty annoying in the previous games. Each of these traversal options added an interesting dimension to navigating arenas while sniping mercenaries and lobbing explosives in the faces of the local fauna, and also went a long way to speeding up how quickly I could close distance between me and the baddies in my path. That was a welcome change, because I’d always found myself frustrated by how slowly I move in old Borderlands entries. If there’s anything worrisome about all these extra ways to get around, it’s that there are so many of them I often forgot to use them. Being able to double jump, glide, and grapple hook across a room all in the same motion honestly feels like too much power, at least in the hands of a rookie like me who only had a few hours to familiarize myself with it all. By the end of the demo, though, I felt a lot better about my ability to keep myself in motion while bringing my arsenal to bear upon swarms of monsters, but it definitely feels like it’ll take some getting used to.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be a Borderlands game without the promise of a bottomless cache of weapons to discover, each designed to inject a little anarchy into combat. While I only got a small sampling of what’s in store, there honestly weren’t a ton of things I wasn’t expecting, even with the additional weapon manufacturers introducing some new stufft. One of the new gunmakers, Ripper, seem to have a lot in common with the COV weapons from Borderlands 3, as they need to spin up before they can be fired, but then pile on a heaping helping of lead into enemies, while Daedelus reminded me a lot of the Dahl weapons that offer multiple ammo types to switch between. The only distinct new type I got to try out was called The Order, which have an alternate firing mode – like a pistol I found that could create gravity wells instead of shooting normal bullets. Most of what I played was from pretty early in the campaign, and I only found a single legendary weapon during my travels, so it’s fairly likely there are more surprises I haven’t seen, but at least on the surface I wasn’t too shocked with what I found in that regard.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Get Built</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What seems significantly more distinct are the new buildcrafting options, including a healing item, called a Repkit, that can be used in addition to the usual pickups you find in chests and pick off the sorry corpses of slain foes. These add an interesting dimension to defining your build, as you could just play it safe and equip the item that offers the most healing with the shortest cooldown, but bolder vault hunters might instead favor one that intentionally offers lesser healing benefits to instead grant some other effect every time the item is used. For example, I found one that caused a large explosion of cryo to explode around me whenever I used it, versus another that restored significantly more health and could be used twice before it needed to be cooled down.h Depending on how risky you want to play it, or the specific strategy behind your build, I could see this opening up a lot of doors for clever min-maxers to do some pretty fun stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Borderlands has a different roster of vault hunters to play, and this entry is no different. I got the chance to try out Vex, the magical siren whose main focus (at least with my setup) was in summoning NPC companions to help me fight off mobs, and Rafa, a soldier who had a bunch of high-tech gadgets to unload onto anyone stupid enough to get in his way – including some melee blades that made short work of anyone within arm’s reach, or some shoulder-mounted cannons that automatically helped me lather folks in lead. It’s al  ways hard to tell just how awesome each of these bonafide badasses is going to be after just a few hours, but I was already very much heartened by the number of interesting options to pick from, and I already felt myself transforming into an armed-to-the-teeth instrument of death, even as low-leveled as I was. Also, some of the perks I saw on those trees looked downright spicy, like the ability to disconnect Rafa’s shoulder-mounted turrets to convert them into a stationary battle station, so consider me pretty hyped to try out a late-game build.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Story Time</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting change coming with Borderlands 4 is the new, clearly darker setting and story. Taking place on a new world called Kairos, the world has been dominated by an oppressive, immortal being known as the Timekeeper, who controls the population using cybernetic implants. But naturally, the actions of the vault keepers in recent Borderlands entries (which I won’t spoil here) has ruined the perfect, unjust order on Kairos, throwing the place into chaos, and opening the door for you and your friends to shoot everything in the face and score some sweet new loot. Noice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in tone is pretty clear, and even though you’ve still got the usual cheeky characters, sexual innuendos, and over-the-top gore, there’s also quite a bit of darkness and the beginnings of what seems to be a significantly more grounded story in play, which will hopefully wash away some of the shallowness found in Borderlands 3 – specifically where the antagonists are concerned. It’s also worth noting the intentional shift away from Pandora to focus on this new world. This, combined with the fact that a lot of the cast is entirely new (at least in the sections I played), makes things feel a bit like a soft reboot that gives a fresh start to tell new stories compared to prior games that have mostly leaned pretty heavily on the locations and characters established in their predecessors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 feels a bit like a soft reboot that gives a fresh start to tell new stories compared to prior games that have mostly leaned pretty heavily on the locations and characters established in their predecessors.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m all for this shift, honestly, because although Borderlands was my addiction for many years, it’s also pretty clearly been on its backfoot as a series, as the looter shooter space has both evolved and become more crowded, especially where its ongoing live-service peers are concerned. To be clear, I don’t want to see Borderlands chase the GaaS model and fundamentally change what it is, but it’s nice to see that Gearbox seems willing to take some sizeable risks in pursuit of evolving the series, because I genuinely think it needs to do so if it wants to keep the attention of longtime fans like myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that there isn’t a ton of good, old fashioned Borderlands goodness inside Borderlands 4 – quite the opposite. I still spent ludicrous amounts of time dabbing on loads of enemies who shouted expletives at me after running out of darkened spawn points, watched colorful loot explode out of enemies like fireworks, and ran doglike enemies over with my vehicle, which is now very awesomely available to be summoned anywhere on the map, rather than having to be picked up at a designated spawn point (thank God). There are also perilous vaults to be raided and massive, badass bosses to take down in the name of loot, XP, and bragging rights – which I unfortunately can’t show you today, because of some unfortunate restrictions on what I’m allowed to showcase at this time. But I can say that the one boss I fought a number of times is perhaps the most mechanics-heavy and interesting enemy I’ve encountered in Borderlands, and if it’s at all representative of the level of quality we can expect from Borderlands 4, then we’re in for quite a treat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After several hours dipping my toes into what is sure to be a massive looter shooter, I’m much more optimistic about Borderlands 4’s odds of recapturing my affections after years apart. Stay tuned in the coming days, when I’m allowed to show off some later game footage and a boss fight that I took down a number of times in an effort to grind out some unique weapons – old habits die hard, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What questions do you have about Borderlands 4?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Illustration: Kelsey Short</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Earlier this year, a popular YouTube channel with 648k subscribers was hijacked by the character Stingy from Icelandic children’s show <em>LazyTown</em>. For a few months, the channel would upload various video game remixes, the majority of which were increasingly complex variations of “<a href="https://youtu.be/2dTh3iI0is8?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mine Song</a>,” an abrasive, minute-long song where the character proclaims that everything he sees is “mine.” The channel is SiIvaGunner, an elaborate non-profit community devoted to trolly remixes, elaborately constructed in-jokes, deeply layered storytelling, surprising bangers and, most importantly, high quality rips.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Welcome to SiIvaGunner!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_NFate6AfzU?list=PLL0CQjrcN8D23K_2QVW1dhr5wn5YNaBYA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The basic elevator pitch for SiIvaGunner is simple: a YouTube channel that initially seems to upload regular video game music, but is in fact uploading elaborate edits of those songs. Currently, the most popular upload, at roughly nine million views, is titled “Athletic Theme (PAL Version) - Super Mario World.” It begins almost identically to the SNES classic, but roughly 13 seconds in, it shifts to being a cover of the 1958 novelty song “Witch Doctor”<em> </em>in the style of “Athletic Theme.” Finally, to drive the point home for those who haven’t picked up on the joke, vocals drop in 47 seconds from the 1998 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAr5tzZxdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eurodance cover of “Witch Doctor</a>” by Danish band Cartoons.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Main Theme (PAL Version) - Balatro" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LRoOq9wupg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Explaining the history of SiIvaGunner (spelled with two mixed case “i”s, as in “siivagunner”) is complicated in part because of the sheer amount of kayfabe and lore baked into its premise. “Chaze the Chat, the original founder of the channel, came up with the idea after posting a few ‘fakeout’ style video game music edits on SoundCloud back in 2015,” lead manager Emma (who goes by MtH), told me in a group interview with ten different representatives of SiIvaGunner. “Inspired by the many similar older troll videos on YouTube (think rickrolls and such) he had the idea of pretending to be a video game music uploader, in this case a parody of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22916040/nintendo-video-game-music-osts-youtube-gilvasunner-copyright-takedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giLvasunner</a> [called giivasunner; caps changed for clarity, who] was a popular uploader at the time. And so the idea originally, before both channels were <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1490092359228526592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned due to copyright strikes</a>, was to appear indistinguishable from a popular, real channel.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This infographic was posted to X in 2022 following the termination of GilvaSunner’s account. SiIvaGunner (rightmost) is the subject of this article. Credit: MTH/@emmnyaa</figcaption></figure><p>SiIvaGunner’s existence is also an indirect consequence of the SoundClown movement, a mashup parody scene which focused on increasingly elaborate and absurd joke edits. “Pretty much everyone initially involved with the channel met through SoundClown (or what remained of it at the time),” MtH said, a statement echoed by fellow backroom manager Maggie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The lasting legacy of SoundClown, beyond the touches of it in pop culture now, is SiIvaGunner,” said Morgan Imago, a DJ and producer who was in the SoundClown scene and remembered the rise of SiIvaGunner. “They took the ball and ran with it. SiIva took that bitter, walled garden irony and turned it into a force to uplift rather than tear down. They figured out how to twist the artform into something that made people smile, without making them feel bad in the process, and for that I can't really thank them enough.”&nbsp;</p><p>Founder Chaze The Chat would eventually leave the channel. Though the project would have internal ups and downs like any community, SiIvaGunner would continue to grow over time, exploding structurally into a semi-hierarchical, explicitly non-profit organization for the creation of funny jokes, elaborate lore, storytelling and music. SiIvaGunner is not simply a YouTube channel, it is a community, with more in common with an artist collective, a mutual aid group, or a worker’s cooperative in the service of what they call “High Quality Rips.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dire, Dire Docks (OST Version) - Super Mario 64" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CH97oY2pZpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Being a fan of SiIvaGunner’s output is complicated but rewarding. A part of this is that YouTube makes it difficult to just listen to all of the uploads of a single channel, meaning you have to take a more active role when catching up. Listening to that many game rips will also just do freakish but wonderful stuff to your YouTube algorithm.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Time To Make History (Alpha Version) - Persona 4 Golden" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1scae8YvjiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>But the weirdest effect is when a rip is so appropriate that it starts to overwrite the original song in your head. This has happened to me with a rip that mixes “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be7kbHnxcRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No More What Ifs</a>”<em> </em>from<em> Persona 5</em> with Laufey’s “From The Start,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/1scae8YvjiE?si=ZjbS2nBPLOkseQ4j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time To Make History</a>”<em> </em>from <em>Persona 4,</em> and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PWMiy4RysI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doritos and Fritos”<em> </em>by 100 gecs</a>, and one that mixes “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-S2kKPlkc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pigstep”<em> </em></a>from <em>Minecraft</em> with “Starboy”<em> </em>by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk</a>. “I unironically like this rip to the point where listening to the original actually sounds weird,” one user commented on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mLcv2J-czo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bramble Blast - Super Smash Bros. Brawl.</a>”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How To Survive On YouTube By Making No Money And Taking No Credit</strong></h2><p>SiIvaGunner’s thoroughness in their approach to the complex ethics of fair use is impressive. Copyright is a minefield and trying to make money off of YouTube is a mercenary existence that can destroy the creators who dedicate their lives to it. In the <a href="https://highquality.rip/ripguide/part-0-ethics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ethics statement</a> in their official ripping guide, the SiIvaGunner community is clear: “First and foremost, you generally cannot make money from your edited video game music. Do not sell it, do not ask for donations, and to be honest, you shouldn’t even run ads against it. This is not a hobby you should come into expecting to profit from.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bramble Blast - Super Smash Bros. Brawl" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mLcv2J-czo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>“SiIvaGunner has always been pretty stubbornly non-commercial on pretty much everywhere it should apply, considering we're first and foremost a remix collective,” RHMan, who joined in 2018, told me in our interview. “Our community is pretty set on this principle. Although people have made things akin to us on YouTube, we don't monetize anything we make because our entire model works off the basis that nobody gets paid, and we're all volunteering for fun. The channel isn't monetized (any ads you might see are added by YouTube). On the Bandcamp platform for albums, people have the option to pay, but we expressly discourage this and all the payment we receive is redirected to charity and adding more free download credits. At MAGFests in the past, we've sold limited-order merchandise based off of original artwork from our art branch, which similarly goes to charities and making the convention events possible. However, we're still not ‘incorporated’ in any way; this has always been a loose collective of people doing this for the love of the game.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ievan Polkka (OST Version) - Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Future Tone" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wZz0cMlVx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>“A point that not many people think about is that even if we wanted to make money off of this (which we don't),” circunflexo, a visual artist and backroomer who joined the team in 2022, added, “actually distributing that profit to the rest of the team fairly would be next to impossible with how many moving parts go into most of our projects. Any profit that we incur as a result of merch sales at physical events such as MAGFest goes straight into recuperating the initial investment cost and the rest to charity.”</p><p>Though originally the channel existed under the pretense that a mysterious figure was uploading all of these, this kayfabe has loosened as time has gone on and the structure changed. Still, the channel remains rooted in certain core ideological values. “There are still, and will likely always be, major parts of the channel that keep up the kayfabe, the largest of those being regular rips on YouTube, which we almost to a rule never credit the original ripper for,” backroom manager ChickenSuitGuy told me. While certain original arrangements, artwork, special releases, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0CQjrcN8D37iAA8C5zrpAfkUbyhfKT3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fusion collaborations</a> often give credit, the meat and potatoes uploads are by SiIvaGunner collectively, not individuals. “Ultimately not having credit also keeps us aligned with the core value of the channel, so that people make rips for fun rather than trying to get any sort of clout or value associated with our platform, especially regarding edited video game music.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MAGFest 2024: SiIvaGunner: 7 Grand Years of High Quality Rips" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYt5I55WOp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Keeping up with SiIvaGunner can be a challenge given its upload frequency – it is not uncommon to see 10 SiIvaGunner uploads in a single day. Managing this workload is a complex task done entirely over Discord and involves a tiered management system for editing and quality control. Managers, including everyone interviewed for this piece, are part of what is known as “backroom,” a title you work up to as time goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have a whole system worked out on Discord for submitting rips, whether you're a team member or fan emailer,” backroom member minindo told me, “reviewing them for quality and accuracy, and then putting them into a queue to be uploaded on our bihourly schedule. A lot of this process was developed gradually over the years to make things easier, as the team and the amount of stuff they made increased in production value and just sheer amount.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Spiral Ahead - R4: Ridge Racer Type 4" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNX112YVCi4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Discord emotes are used to denote the current status of a rip in the “QoC” channel, which stands for “Quality of Control,” a chat typo from a member that eventually became canonical terminology. Once final approval is given, the rip is added to the upload rotation in a special program specifically designed for the task, <a href="https://siiva-gunner.com/Ripper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the High Quality Ripper</a> program created by backroomer Moder. Without this specific piece of software, uploading with this frequency year after year would be tedious, if not impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>During a MAGFest panel, the team joked that<a href="https://youtu.be/SYt5I55WOp8?si=1z5HZ-Zok6SskpvF&amp;t=191" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the structure of the organization resembles a Ponzi scheme</a> “with "Rippers" at the base level, "Quality Control/Quality of Control" above them, and then "Backroom" at the top.” RHMan told me that the structure of the organization has changed significantly even in the last year: “We have a few separate branches, each specializing on different mediums. One for rippers, one for art (SG Art Team), and one for arrangements (SiIvaGunner Fusion Records, or SGFR). Backroom serves as a group of managers from all of the branches, as the council that decides the fate of important channel decisions. For the rippers side, the base level is rippers, who can then get promoted to a Quality Control position after showing a dedication to quality in their rips, and then can be further promoted to Backroom given enough dedication for consistently helping and being involved. For the other branches, it also works similarly, but essentially people are promoted when they've shown a lot of interest and willingness to help run the channel for a long period of time.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pigstep - A Minecraft Movie" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VN67qoZVfF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>“I think the importance of voting is that for our management systems, since the founder (Chaze) left, we have used a democratic system for decisions whether that's in quality control, backroom, or otherwise,”&nbsp; backroomer Heboyi told me. “Most major decisions are put up to a vote among the channel managers. This includes organizational changes or fixing problems, but also pitches that come from any members of the team for various projects like channel events, takeovers and major collaborations. Any member of the team is able to pitch an event they want on the channel, and the managers build the schedule around the various events that people in the team are most excited towards.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This level of organization was also reflected in how the interview was conducted. How do you go about interviewing a collective? The solution was worked out in the interview, and reflected the organization itself: I was invited to a newly created temporary Discord for this specific purpose, and 10 representatives of the backroom were chosen. As I dropped my questions for this interview into Discord, different backroomers took turns drafting individual responses while others communicated the status of those responses. This allowed for a collective distribution of work while fairly representing a broad section of different viewpoints. Watching the team figure out how best to answer my questions itself became a shining example of how to democratically run a collective.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Human Music (Extended Mix) - Pocket Mortys" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpVcY3u6TYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Though everyone I interviewed was technically “backroom,” certain members within the organization take on different responsibilities based on their specific interests, such as side projects, collabs, storytelling and even an art team. “The production of artwork for the channel has some interesting facets to it,” SG Art Team director moralem told me. “The direction tends to be more freeform as it tries to adapt to the people who are actively interested in contributing to a specific thing. Despite the size of the team, a lot of channel projects tend to become small circles as writers, editors, musicians and artists refine their finished products, bouncing ideas off each other with reduced input from the rest of the team besides some backroom/lead oversight to ensure a proper pipeline.” Since the art team came from the ripping team, it shares some with how project management is done.</p><p>On top of managing a complex system of “QoC,” collaborations, and artwork, the channel is also a platform for storytelling, much of which is documented in explainer videos and <a href="https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Story_arcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the SiIvaGunner wiki</a>. “The amount of lore on the channel may be surprising, and probably overwhelming to many viewers trying to get into it, but we have playlists on the channel to act as a guide for those willing to (try to) understand it the best they can,”&nbsp; backroomer Grambam36 told me. This began back when the original channel was <a href="https://youtu.be/7DIWZVGWAWY?si=bybGXgLAk0WtF-Fz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted </a>and <a href="https://youtu.be/uNnqzjb6sT0?si=mqZrWmRYjc7VkSA-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooted</a> in 2016 – individual characters and running jokes came to the forefront, and the channel underwent various story arcs. One of these story arcs, a visual novel style pastiche known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCKrU75WCw&amp;list=PLL0CQjrcN8D0lwvLRcGFUJJIeTcZW9Mlq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The SiIvaGunner Christmas Comeback Crisis</a> was originally meant to terminate in 2016, but has taken over 10 years to complete and is only now reaching its conclusion. “It may be strange to have such a large and somewhat complicated story for a channel such as this, but we do these stories to this day because we find it fun and compelling, and we are always coming up with new ideas,” Grambam36 said.</p><figure><figcaption>The Joke-Explainer™ 7000, the helpful guide of SiIvaGunner. Credit: SiIvaGunner.</figcaption></figure><p>“The current face of the channel is an original character dubbed The Joke-Explainer™ 7000,” circunflexo told me. Originally meant to be a side character, Joke-Explainer™ 7000 now serves as a de-facto ambassador for the channel, a helpful voice to onboard new users into a world of increasingly complex lore.</p><h2><strong>For Fans, By Fans, And (Sometimes) Against Fans</strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nuclear (Unused Game Version) - Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FE6RuZuvjMs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Most people within SiIvaGunner started off as a fan of some sort, which is often seen in the comments. “The SiIvaGunner ‘community’ is definitely more complex than it is at first glance,”&nbsp; backroomer Madinstance told me. “There's a group of people in the comments, a group of people in the fan server, there's groups of people that make fan channels (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TimmyTurnersGrandDad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TimmyTurnersGrandDad</a>), and there's groups of people who submit and are part of the team.” It’s a conversational relationship, one which is often playfully confrontational and slightly sadistic. Madinstance cited “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Halation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snow Halation</a>,” a song from the anime <em>Love Live </em>which was included in so many rips that the community eventually turned on them, resulting in dislike bombing. “Snow Halation,” in turn, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B8ADYhE_ms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would lead to an entire narrative arc of its own</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Burning Desires - Zenless Zone Zero" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/blPyHfAA9cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Another recent example: flooding the channel with rips involving the aggressively annoying “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPVDIDUQJdE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burning Desires</a>”<em> </em>by Sān-Z and HOYO-MiX for the character <a href="https://zenless-zone-zero.fandom.com/wiki/Burnice_White" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burnice from the game <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. Spotting negative reactions in the comments and driving the joke into the ground until the community experiences a form of Stockholm Syndrome is quintessentially SiIvaGunner. “Though even though some of the commenters have turned into contributors, we still try and keep our eye out for comment reactions that we can capitalize on to involve our audience... for better or worse,”&nbsp; Madinstance said. This confrontation is a part of the culture. “A lot of the team tends to gravitate towards jokes that objectively suck,” they added later.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Super Bell Hill (Beta Mix) - Super Mario 3D World" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8G8bmGD8K4?list=PLkx3OM5m2wV1vlb9NCvpRA6DBMlfjBOzi" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>The <em>LazyTown</em> Stingy takeover that dominated the channel for a few months is a perfect example of how a joke driven into the dirt can become beloved by the community through sheer insistence. “It's still hilarious how quickly people accepted Stingy into their lives,” circunflexo said. “We got fanart day 1. People falter fast." Madinstance added. The Stingy rips numbered in the hundreds by the end of the takeover, melting the heart of even the most cynical commenter. “You know what, I'm giving in. Everything truly is his. There's nothing we can do. That's all there is to it,” commenter <a href="https://youtu.be/Raoj35qIOyQ?si=WrYy5BeOhgyoYkr6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@jongarfield6508 admitted</a>.&nbsp;Since conducting this interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/3csAfayH1xg?si=8mx7LHdN7G0Lmazc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stingy has taken the channel over again</a> for "the month of June."</p><h2><strong>Everyone expresses themselves differently</strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mice on Venus - Minecraft" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_kMOdftgGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are a shocking number of angles to approach a rip, and everyone has their own favorites. Simply search for YouTube playlists called “SiIvaGunner bangers” or <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ioagziC2VQdcVBrAR5omkseqZHk0MsC&amp;si=x8AaM_uMNYnNOz76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SiIvaGunner Essential</a> and you’ll see loads. I wanted to know the favorite rips of the people who manage the channel. Backroomer minindo prefers rips where vocals are pitch shifted and recontextualized into a new song, but the song still works. “The joke is ‘Somebody That I Used to Know’ (2011) by Gotye, and it's just perfectly combined with ‘Mice on Venus’ in a way that's funny and sounds actually beautiful, in my opinion.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Angel Island Zone (Act 1) (Alpha Mix) - Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRpzErazjo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“One of my favourite things to see in a rip is when someone does a musical joke that isn't necessarily a reference, like looping a repeated section for the whole track or extending an ascending/descending melody to keep going,” MtH said. “A recent favourite in that category is ‘Angel Island Zone (Act 1) (Alpha Mix),’ which adapts the entirety of Herbie Hancock's ’Come Running To Me’ into a seven-and-a-half minute (without looping!) <em>Sonic 3</em> arrangement complete with nods and references to songs from the game.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Boss (Beta Mix) - Plok" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yU4oR-x8gVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“I love arrangement rips,” Maggie said. “There are a ton of good ones and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5danp3qLlg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've even made a few</a>, but my favorite not made by me is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4oR-x8gVk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss (Beta Mix) - Plok</a>, which turns the original song into a cover of ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/qFfybn_W8Ak?si=iJuwgcF-6KoAmmeu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roller Mobster’ by Carpenter Brut</a>. I especially love when there's a certain artificiality or crunchiness that comes from sequenced music, arrangement or not, and I think hearing songs get transferred to that kind of style is fun.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Backroomer Moralem also has a Plok-themed favorite, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnNjlD_qymU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Main Theme (Beta Mix) - Plok</a>, “which is an arrangement of the title screen from <em>Solstice</em>, if you haven't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_gObHt1uZA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listened to the original</a>, you should do that too!”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Koopa Cape - Mario Kart Wii" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSxq0ewQp5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“I really love it when rips do something outside of the original bounds of its sources,” ChickenSuitGuy said. “For example, there are rips that take a song with let's say, a simple trap beat, but in the rip they add on their own extra instrumentation to make the rip fuller and more interesting. There are also rips that take advantage of the original source's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSxq0ewQp5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocals being synthesized</a> and use that to come up with their own lyrics in the rip.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Showdown with the Ultimate Chimera - MOTHER 3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pm40bc0OD60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If there is a SiIvaGunner magnum opus, it is probably the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm40bc0OD60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showdown with the Ultimate Chimera - MOTHER 3</a>, the final rip of a beloved and deceased community member. “Aside from the personal connection of it being made by a close friend of mine who's no longer with us, it is a very impressive rip designed to incorporate every single <em>MOTHER 3</em> battle theme into a singular arrangement of ‘Dancing Mad’ from <em>Final Fantasy 6</em>,” Madinstance told me. “It ended up inspiring a trend of rips in the years since its release, and I think has put a lot of emphasis on SiIvaGunner as a place of artistic expression.” Showdown is indeed impressive: a more than 16 minute long masterwork with fully original, beautiful sprite work that totally recontextualizes the final boss fight against Kefka. It is a final work of a beloved friend, one who passed far too young, and the comments in memoriam are a tribute to the strength and beauty of what is possible in a community like SiIvaGunner.</p><h2><strong>Finding a future in the silliest place possible</strong></h2><p>When I started listening to SiIvaGunner’s channel years ago, I signed up for one thing: High quality rips. That hasn’t changed, but I have, and so has the community that SiIvaGunner represents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We've worked a lot to actively improve the team and its communications throughout the past year, always trying to make sure that we're doing the best we can do for our team and for the benefit of running things smoothly,” RHMan told me. “Like originally, people were just sending things to Chaze to get them uploaded. Now, there's a system for that. Channel events used to be mostly sources backroom+chaze found funny enough to make rips for an entire day with, but now there's a whole system for any ripper to pitch their own event (though sometimes we'll still have a spontaneous funny event because we feel like it). We're very much learning and adapting to a world where SiIvaGunner is increasingly a multi-medium platform where we have to balance creating large art projects while keeping a steady output of rips onto the channel. As backroomers, it's very much a team effort.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Radical Dreamers ~ Unstolen Jewel - Chrono Cross" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBdlOKOxPJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure><p>Workers and artists managing both themselves and each other is an atypical arrangement in the current world. Often you realize that you are workshopping new or forgotten structures as you try them out, like trying to interview 10 people simultaneously. What you come up with is often imperfect, and can take a long time to get right. Aftermath as a worker’s cooperative is a work in progress, and I pray that we are ultimately successful. But when you see something that works, that survives in an otherwise toxic environment, it plants the seeds of something better elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, the salted earth we struggle against is the collapse of a media ecosystem. In SiIvaGunner’s case, it thrives in the foul topsoil of YouTube. They have managed to survive thanks in no small part to a lot of work and because they have each other. It is democratic and constantly trying to be better, with each contributing according to their ability – from lowly ripper, QoC, to art, planning, and everyone in Backroom. And even, or rather because, it makes no money, it represents the best of what the internet can be. It’s a reminder that, to quote David Graeber, “the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.” SiIvaGunner is a song about life, and it’s high quality.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Field of Hopes and Dreams (PAL Version) - Deltarune" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-kS3jEzVeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Recent hits include updates to classic franchises like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Metal Slug Tactics, and Streets of Rage 4, while the company's porting pedigree also includes the Final Fantasy franchise, as well as multiple Neo Geo titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher is double-dipping into nostalgia in 2025, first with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, and then with Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest collaboration between Dotemu and Tribute Games. After getting some hands-on time with the new sidescrolling arcade superhero beat-'em-up at Summer Game Fest 2025, the evolution of what the two companies built in Shredder's Revenge so far seems worthy of the superhero names it includes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | She-Hulk &amp; Rocket Raccoon Character Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">My demo began with me selecting two heroes from a group of seven available choices: Captain America, Nova, Storm, Venom, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Phyla-Vell. The seven heroes have distinct movesets and abilities--which is a step forward from Shredder's Revenge, where outside of little nuances, each Ninja Turtle you could control functioned essentially the same way.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, I took my dynamic duo into the streets of New York, where I immediately began facing off against the hordes working for villain Annihilus. You control one hero at a time and can swap them at will. Each hero has multiple attacks, ranging from quick jabs to slow but powerful strikes, as well as an arsenal of moves they can execute in the air. You can also combine attack buttons for a super attack, at the cost of some health--which is a mechanic steeped in 2D beat-'em-up history that I absolutely appreciated seeing here again.</p><p dir="ltr">Choosing the right combination of heroes in Marvel Cosmic Invasion seems like it's going to be very important, especially because of the previously-mentioned distinct attributes. Nova, for example, thrives on long-distance combat thanks to his energy wave attacks, while Wolverine prefers to be up close and personal with his claws and powerful throw attack. You can also switch between your two heroes on the fly, which allowed me to tailor my offensive strategy to the situation I was currently facing--if my enemies had ranged attacks, I needed to switch to my long-range attacker, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">This adds an extra layer of strategy to each encounter that helps the entire experience drift away from "mindless button-mashing" to a more measured approach, which benefits the game overall. It also allows for tactical decisions--if my inactive character was really low on health, I could instead call them in as an assist for a single attack, which gave me breathing room during a particularly hectic battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4516633-marvel_cosmic_invasion_screenshot_5.png"

dir="ltr">Fighting enemies looks, sounds, and feels great, with each individual strike making a satisfying "thud" when it connects with an unlucky enemy. The super attacks are particularly flashy, filling the screen with effects as every enemy on the screen is wiped out--I like Storm's electricity the most, as it reminds me of her super move in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, but every hero's super attack has a dash of flair to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo also featured two boss battles, one against the villain Beetle under the influence of one of Annihilus's thralls, and one featuring Taskmaster just being his normal Taskmaster self. Both boss fights followed the classic 2D beat-'em-up boss fight formula--battles that played out in stages, with a giant health bar at the bottom, and the boss using powerful moves for big damage--and both offered a nice challenge at the end of each stage.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I did notice one extra wrinkle in each boss battle: each boss's health bar had a blue frame around it, which I had to remove with attacks before the red health bar would decrease. This represented a sort of "shield" that prevented me from dealing direct damage, and which would occasionally refill at different parts of the fight. The shield mechanic added a bit more difficulty to the battle--even if that difficulty only amounted to a few extra seconds' worth of attacks--but I'm now interested to see how Tribute will continue to iterate on the standard boss battle formula in the full release.</p><p dir="ltr">My time with Marvel Cosmic Invasion went exactly how I expected it to go: I beat up a bunch of enemies, fought some cool bosses, and bathed in a wave of 2D nostalgia thanks to Tribute Games's talent for recreating the arcade feelings of old. While there are a few new elements at play here--more varied character abilities, extra elements in boss battles, and so on--this still feels like a game I would have played and loved in my childhood. Getting that nostalgic feeling right is what will make Marvel Cosmic Invasion a hit when it finally launches, and so far, Tribute has nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Cosmic Invasion is scheduled to release later this year on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> bundle, as a series exec has confirmed there's still a big <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield (2025)</a> reveal set to come this summer.</p>
<p>This Mass Effect bundle comes with various N7-themed skins for both specialists and weapons, with a "Citadel Bundle" containing all Mass Effect cosmetics for 3,000 Battlefield Currency. This comes to roughly £22.50 / $25 in value, though you'd have to buy 2,400 <em>and</em> 1,100 BFC separately. </p>
<p>A few days ahead of the bundle's reveal,  Battlefield Studios' Global Senior Director of Integrated Comms Andy McNamara <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934708241810043104">responded to a fan on Twitter</a> to say the team has "some things brewing", suggesting a reveal of a new game was on the way. Then, following the announcement of the Mass Effect bundle, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">McNamara posted</a>: "The community will know when the reveal is coming. We are focused on Labs and preparing for the reveal this summer".</p>

<p>So there's still something to look forward to in the next month or so. We first learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-full-battlefield-reveal-coming-this-summer-as-it-reconfirms-release-window">this summer reveal back in May</a>, as a proper showcase of what the game will look and play like has yet to be produced by the company. The actual name of this new Battlefield is yet to be revealed, an indicator of how much of a mystery the game remains. There have been a series of invite-only playtests, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">though information from those has leaked online</a>.</p>
<p>In response, EA stated that "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">things taking place in Labs may or may not make their way to the final</a>" game as it cracked down on leakers. Aside from that, all we know is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">EA is still aiming to release the game before April 2026</a>.</p>
<p>One would assume that Summer Game Fest would have been a good time to show off this new Battlefield in earnest, but it appears EA is comfortable taking its time with the game still cooking in the oven. Its absence did however allow Call of Duty to take the spotlight somewhat, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 wrapping up the Xbox showcase</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Preview - Co-op Buddies, Assemble!]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been really impressed with Marvel's video game lineup, recently. I'm not even that big on superheroes, but these games coming from Marvel constantly have me excited -- games like&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em><em>'s Wolverine&nbsp;</em>and the recently announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>. Perhaps most of all, though, I'm eager to see the release of the upcoming beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, I was able to play&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;earlier this month at Summer Game Fest 2025. A retro-style beat 'em up with a roster of popular and slightly more niche Marvel heroes, grab a few friends and some brewskies for this one, since you'll be hooked to the CRT all night long.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Diverse Roster to Choose From</h2>

<p>First things first, hero selection. You're not picking one character to play as, but two. You can switch between these in the middle of combat, which makes combat more varied and dynamic. There are 15 heroes in all, so plenty of combinations are possible. So far, Marvel and developer Tribute Games seem pretty tight-lipped on this beat 'em up's roster.</p>

<p>Just recently, we saw the announcement of She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon as new inclusions to the current selection, that being Spider-Man, Captain America, Venom, Wolverine, Nova, Storm, and Phyla-Vell. Clearly, they're going for a nice mix of heroes here, so really, anyone could show up. Heck, Squirrel Girl or Jeff seem just as likely as Iron Man or Thor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my first playthrough, I went with Captain America and Venom. Any duo should be optimal, though, since this is a beat 'em up, after all. Gameplay is really tight. You could theoretically button mash and be fine, but there's a bit of nuance to each skillset to make every hero feel true to their personality and powers.</p>



<h2>Venom and Captain American = BFFs</h2>

<p>Captain America, for instance, throws his shield and has a strong uppercut to take down pesky air enemies. He's an all-rounder with a decent set of moves, if a bit generic. Great for juggling enemies, though, which I tried my best to do at every chance I could get!</p>

<p>Venom, on the other hand, is this chaotic mass of goo that wreaks havoc on the battlefield. He morphs into different shapes and can take down groups of enemies pretty fast. Despite his size, he's agile both on the ground and while swinging around with his web.</p>



<p>My favorite aspect of Venom,<em>&nbsp;</em>though, is his move that grabs enemies. You can pound bad guys into the ground, or throw them. I was always flinging guys around, throwing them off ledges and wherever else I could have them insta-die. He can grab in mid-air too, so flying enemies better look out.</p>

<p>I played with TechRaptor Editor-in-Chief Andrew Otton, and he went with Spider-Man and Wolverine. He seemed to favor Wolverine, who was just an absolute menace on the battlefield, tearing things up. Now, for our second go-around, I went with two new characters as did Andrew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My new team now comprises Spider-Man and&nbsp;Phyla-Vell. She's a character I'm very unfamiliar with, but her toolkit seems to tick all the right boxes. She floats around and uses her sword to attack. What I really like about&nbsp;Phyla-Vell is that she can throw her sword, and once it hits an enemy, press the button again and she teleports to the sword.</p>



<p>This allows you to travel across the battlefield and meet enemies and reinforcements head-on. I could definitely see her being a mainstay to my team. Andrew also took a liking to Storm who, from a gameplay perspective, seems like another mechanically diverse character. Tribute Games does a good job at making every character shine in their own special ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character has a special move you can use once a gauge is full, but there's also a sort of tag-team mechanic. It reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>&nbsp;to some degree, where the one character you have benched can come in and land a hit or two; of course, you can always outright switch and play as them with the click of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;is super fast-paced, and so great to play with others. I like that there's more to it than just simple button mashing, and I can't wait to see what combinations I can make once the full roster is revealed. Really, if you enjoyed the developer's previous beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge,&nbsp;</em>you'll like this just as much, if not even more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion, and if you're a fan of adorably indistinct fox-cat-dog 'mon Eevee, then you're going to love this one.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th, bringing with it new cards based on Eevee and many of its evolutions (colloquially referred to as Eeveelutions, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>The expansion, which follows on from previous large-scale expansions like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, will introduce more than 100 new cards to collect, including an Eevee ex card with the adorably-named ability "Veevee 'volve". All together now: d'awwww.</p>

In short, if you're a fan of Eevee and its subsequent forms, you're going to love this.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just Eevee; you'll also find a new Trainer card in the form of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Penny, who allows you to look at a random Supporter card in your opponent's deck (as long as it isn't Penny) and steal its effect, as well as shuffling that card back into the deck.</p>

<p>A new Eevee Bag item is also being added as a Trainer card, which buffs Eeveelutions and allows you to heal them as well. If you're building an Eevee-centric deck, you'll want this as part of your arsenal.</p>




<p>If you're not a fan of Eevee...well, first, I'd urge you to check your priorities and get the help you need. Assuming you don't want to do that, however, you'll find other 'mons included in this expansion, like Swirlix, Alcremie, and Milcery.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th. Stay tuned for more on all things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/688568/summer-game-fest-2025-los-angeles-ice-arrests<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I love going to Summer Game Fest. It’s a rare opportunity to connect with my colleagues and friends in person, as well as listen to developers talk about why they make their games. In some ways, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">this year’s SGF gave me everything I love about the event</a>. But while I was comfortably ensconced in a happy bubble, the escalating conflict between demonstrators protesting against immigration raids and the Los Angeles Police Department cast a dark and soul-shaking pall that could not be ignored. </p><p>Everything started on June 6th, when it was reported that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had conducted a raid in LA’s fashion district, the same area where most of SGF was being held. I wasn’t around to experience that because I was at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, watching Geoff Keighley announce a <em>Game of Thrones</em> RTS and a Wu-Tang game. But when Ian Proulx, <em>Splitgate 2</em> creator and CEO of 1047 Games, came out with his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684957/splitgate-2-hat-apology">now-infamous “Make FPS Great Again” hat</a>, it punctured the illusion of distance in time, space, and tone.</p><p>In the months since President Donald Trump took office, ICE has ramped up its activities, sending agents to snatch parents from their children and children from their schools, enabled under the auspices that removing immigrants will be what makes America great again. Proulx’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682033/everybody-hated-that">hat became the story of the day</a>, if not the whole event. It was the main topic of conversation at the lobby bar of the JW Marriott hotel, where each night of SGF is capped off with a mixer. How could someone choose to reference such a statement, even in jest or irony, as the very people that slogan has been used to target are being snatched up mere blocks away?</p><p>Saturday was business as usual. Proulx’s hat was forgotten as I settled in to work, flitting between wall-to-wall appointments checking out <em>Escape Academy 2</em>, the new <em>Lego Party</em> game, and <em>Deadpool VR </em>with no time to chat or even eat. I didn’t check my phone for hours, and every TV was playing a video game. I had no idea what was happening both in Los Angeles and in the White House. But when there was finally a lull, I popped online, where I was greeted with a deluge of messages from people who <em>were</em> watching the news, telling me that something (a nebulous, undefined, but nevertheless urgent something) was happening and that I needed to get back to the safety of my hotel.</p><p>Thankfully, my worst fears about martial law declarations and curfews didn’t come to pass while I was there, but they did after I was back home. People had taken to the streets of LA in protest of ICE action and began moving through parts of the city, demonstrating and occasionally clashing with the police (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-waymo/682932/la-protest-waymo-fire-destroy-ice-police">and autonomous vehicles</a>). But at that moment, when I was hearing that insurrection acts were going to be invoked and that the National Guard was being mobilized to sweep the city, I became legitimately scared — particularly for attendees who weren’t citizens and those with immigrant families. </p><div><p>How could someone choose to reference such a statement, even in jest or irony?</p></div><p>One such colleague, Janet Garcia, <a href="https://pentopixels.com/article/summer-game-fest-2025-ice-protests-la">wrote an incredible account</a> of what it was like working SGF and being the child of a Mexican immigrant. Her words right now are more important than mine. SGF also coincided with the BET Awards, and honoree Doechii also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/arts/music/doechii-trump-protests-bet-awards.html">had a powerful message for the moment</a>. </p><p>There had already been several stories of international travelers being detained in the US for weeks, and I was scared that if something was happening, my journalist friends from Canada, the UK, and elsewhere could get caught in the mix. Word began spreading that something (again, what that was, nobody could say, and that uncertainty compounded the fear) was happening, and my friends and I all began to start asking aloud: do we need to leave? Some said yes, and I was ready to do just that, but something stopped me.</p><p>I will never be able to adequately express how weird my job is in situations like this. It’s really hard to write about the colorful pixels on a TV when it feels like the world is seconds away from catching fire. And yet I do it every day. Right when I was about to make the decision to leave early, a Capcom PR rep tapped me on the shoulder. I was late to my <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appointment. And I went, because in that scary moment I still thought, “I have a job to do.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata">I did my best with <em>Requiem</em></a>, plodding along the abandoned hospital, being suitably impressed by how the sound of Grace’s footsteps changed when she walked on the wooden floor vs. the floor covered in bits of broken drywall. But my phone kept buzzing with notifications throughout it all. Midway through the demo, my stress was so high from the ambient spookiness of the game and all the happenings outside the SGF bubble that I couldn’t take it anymore. I made my profuse apologies to my PR contact (who was exceedingly gracious and understanding) and left. </p><p>The mood that night at the hotel was less exuberant. It wasn’t just everything going on in LA: the mood of the event itself was the lowest I’d ever seen it in the handful of years that SGF has served as E3’s smaller, vibe-ier replacement. There were games there, good ones, but nothing big enough to anchor the show. As the industry faces its third straight year of rampant layoffs, cancellations, delays, and studio closures we’re finally starting to see the pipeline of blockbuster games dry up. This was a stark contrast to last year when Sega had <em>Metaphor: ReFantanzio </em>and <em>Shadow Generations</em>, Bandai Namco showed off <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, PlayStation was there with <em>Astro Bot</em>, and Xbox had just announced <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p><p>I’m home now. And despite this year’s strangeness, I look forward to going back to Summer Game Fest. Because if video games have taught me anything over the years, it’s that in the face of overwhelming odds, the best thing one can do is stick together with your friends.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
