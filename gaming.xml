			<p>The flight simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-detailed-pc-requirements-ideal-spec-recommends-64gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has been released today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in September</a>. On the surface, it's only the umpteenth game published by Xbox Game Studios on the platform after the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, and more, with the (once) brand-defining IP Halo <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on the way next year</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an XDA Developers interview</a> with Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise head Jorg Neumann, we learned that it might have been this game that started it all. Neumann had first discussed the possibility internally around two and a half years ago and initially received a no for an answer, but eventually Microsoft came around, kicking off, in Neumann's own words, the avalanche of Xbox games on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p><em>It was my idea, actually. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/microsoft-flight-simulator-leaving-jet-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>, we came out on PC first in August 2020. One year later, we shipped it on Xbox, and we found millions and millions of new fans on Xbox that had never seen the flight sim because they're just not PC gamers. A lot of them thought it was great, and a lot of them stayed. In 2020, it was already 120 GB when we launched as a download. When we were in 2023, I looked at the install numbers, and it was 300 GB. Then we had our content roadmap, and there was so much new stuff that we were doing that we would be over a terabyte. I said, "We need to do something," so we decided to make Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and had the concept of a thin client. Our client is now 8 GB, and instead of putting everyone on your hard drive and making that download huge, we put everything in the cloud.</em></p>



<p><em>That made it possible to go to other platforms, so I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation. It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our President, who then came back to me and said, "Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested." I think that really kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Neumann also adds that the studio worked hard to optimize the game for the PlayStation 5 console and the DualSense controller. Indeed, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 supports the following features on PS5:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adaptive triggers that respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air &nbsp;</li>



<li>Gyro controls to control pitch and roll while flying &nbsp;</li>



<li>Lightbar support to provide visual caution / warning cues &nbsp;</li>



<li>The ability to customize the touchpad to handle a variety of tasks
<ul>
<li>By default, users can control an aircraft’s throttle by swiping across its surface &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The built-in controller speaker plays audio from air traffic control </li>
</ul>



<p>As for his Xbox-to-PlayStation multiplatform claim, there is certainly a grain of truth there in that it might have been the first time Microsoft seriously sat down and considered the possibility of porting one of its games (in this case, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024) to the rival console. However, given the downward trajectory of Xbox console sales and Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-unrealistic-financial-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandate to the Xbox division to increase profits</a> after the expensive acquisitions of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, going multiplatform was really only a matter of time.</p>

            <p>
Cassette Boy is a game that looks to follow in the footsteps of perspective puzzlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a> and Tunic, two games I bring up because of their explicit use of space to hide more, tantalizingly secret space. Out of the two, it's much closer to Fez, being a 2D world you can rotate to gain new, three dimensional perspectives. Where Fez is a platformer that switches between different, still 2D planes, Cassette Boy lets you switch between front on and more isometric views, and in its world, anything that can't be seen, doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
This means different things. Cassette Boy is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> RPG, one that emulates the look of an original Game Boy game, and RPGs typically come with dangers. Perhaps there's some kind of nasty beastie blocking your path, or spikes with no gap to cross through. Simply rotate to a new angle, and poof! They're gone. Rotate some more, and they pop right back into existence. You can see why the developer's referred to it as a "Schrödinger System."

<p>
There are battles to be had as well, with fairly simplistic but solid enough sword-based combat you've seen in any of the 2D Zeldas. I wonder how that, in particular, may come into play throughout the game, but I'm also curious if puzzles go a bit further than just making enemies or NPCs disappear so you can walk forwards, as that's mostly what the game's trailers show.
</p><p>
Still, it's a neat concept, one that I'm curious enough about to make me want to check it out. And I don't have to wait long to do that! As it's currently slated for release in just over a month's time on January 14th, 2026. Aside from the existential fear that comes from the steady passage of time, that's pretty good! You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When all is said and done at the end of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ two-hour runtime, Santa Ragione’s horror game feels remarkably unremarkable. The game has been caught in a shit storm of controversy after it was </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio"><span>banned from PC storefronts like Epic and Steam</span></a><span>, and the reasons for that ban are odd, considering the specific content the storefronts mention doesn’t seem to actually exist in the game. Santa Ragione says Valve refused to list </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>on its storefront due to scenes that “depict sexual conduct involving a minor,” but after playing through the game, I’m not sure what this is referring to. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s also not…that.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is grotesque, unsubtle in its imagery, and underneath all the grit, grime, and gore, it is saying </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. It’s just not anything really revolutionary. Its gruesome imagery paints a fairly straightforward image of the psychological damage of a forced puritanical lifestyle on the self and society, and even through its crude, PS2-style aesthetic, it gets its point across well enough. I just wonder how much we would be talking about it had it not been for Valve and Epic’s actions.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself. I haven’t even talked about the minutiae of how </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets there, but that’s because all those details are less interesting than that hypothetical to me. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>stars a young man named Anselmo who is sent off by his parents to work on a rural, out-of-the-way farm in a small town.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That sounds simple enough, until he meets the horses he’ll be taking care of, who are actually humans stripped naked and forced to wear horse masks while acting as if they are a herd of equine animals. You even ride on their shoulders a few times, much to your chagrin. But the disturbing imagery is gradually revealed to be a way for </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>to explore how the farmer’s stunted sexual growth and sex-negative upbringing have caused him to develop a psychosexual need to control others’ sexual behavior, while finding ways around the mental and physical shackles he’s put on himself.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651444">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>If nothing else, </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets this across pretty well, if unsubtly. The farmer comes from a backwater town in which sexual frustration is forced upon a civilization by a doctrine preaching that abstinence is close to godliness, and so his entire life has become fixated on something he wants but has been brainwashed into believing he’s not allowed to have. This man’s entire mental and sexual development has been shackled like a chastity belt, and so he has created an entire business and network supporting a farm in which he is able to force that same self-denial on any poor bastard found wandering near his land.</span></p> <p><span>A lot is being said about </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ use of graphic sexual imagery as the reason for its being banned on the most popular PC storefronts, </span><span>but even as it takes the cross between humanity’s self-imposed religious chains and its animalistic nature to their horrifying extreme, </span><span>I didn’t find it particularly gratuitous. It was exaggerated, meant to be evocative, and in some scenes, comically amplified, but that felt in line with the game’s wider aesthetic choices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t a good game, and its technical presentation is particularly agonizing. It literally made me sick with its stuttering, choppy jank; it’s pretty ugly, and nearly everything about it looks and feels like the work of a team still getting its feet wet in Unity. Still, I’m willing to buy that the ugliness could be a deliberate aesthetic, as the ugly nature of its story is perhaps best captured in a crude, gross-out paint job. When people talk in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, they get unsettling close-ups as their lips flap, broken up by silent-film-style caption cards. Santa Ragione wants this game to feel gross, and it’s not just in the subject matter.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The game your mom was worried about."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Santa Ragione Game Studio  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Horror game in which you tend to a farm while shit gets crazy.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>It communicates what it's trying to get across pretty well.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Actually made me motion sick it was so jittery, ugly but in an artistic way, probably.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>~2 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Every shot of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ run-down farm is framed to make it look like a place lacking any real heart, soul, or love. It is a small space built solely for utility, and since it’s not a farm designed for taking care of animals, everything about it is small, cramped, hastily built, and only stores the titular horses and tools with no consideration for comfort or care. The fact that the game is just ugly to look at only helps Santa Ragione convey that feeling of emotional desolation. I can practically smell the god-awful shit-and-blood-stained farm through my computer as the sound of flies buzzing echoes through my headphones.</span></p> <p><span>My feelings on </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>largely boil down to “yeah, that was probably what they were going for, and it’s delivered in a clear, concise, and effectively crude manner.” I get what </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is saying at any given moment, but I don’t find any of it particularly powerful. It’s striking, but is it </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>memorable? Is anything in this game that much more objectionable than your average Ari Aster film?</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651445">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>There is one moment that has received </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/horses-the-most-controversial-game-of-the-year-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype/"><span>a fair bit of criticism</span></a><span>: a scene in which the farmer forces one horse to sexually assault another so he can watch, pounding on his chastity belt as it happens. This is certainly one of the more horrific moments in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, and most of the game’s worst moments are rooted in sexual violence of some kind. Much like everything else in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, I don’t feel like I have a grand takeaway from this moment’s inclusion beyond it communicates exactly what it’s trying to. I do disagree with the criticism that </span><i><span>Horses’ </span></i><span>use of sexual violence is just another point on a shock value scoreboard, because when the game portrays these disgusting acts of violence, I see how they flow back into its themes of sexual distortion and the psychological effects the farmer’s experiences have had on him. But a tall, dividing fence stands between comprehension and appreciation for its meditations on the matter.</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is fine. It’s not particularly trailblazing, but it knows what it’s trying to convey, and it uses a pretty concise visual metaphor to get it across. It is gross to look at, but I only really mind that when its jittery framerate makes me queasy. I don’t believe it is as distasteful as Epic or Steam does, and I still am surprised that something that feels mostly tame and along the lines of an A24 horror film has caused such controversy. If </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>didn’t expose anything we didn’t already know about the dangers of a sheltered, puritanical lifestyle, it at least unmasked Steam and Epic as cowardly companies that can’t be bothered to actually vet the work they’re barring from entry. I wish we could’ve had the conversation those bans sparked about a better game, but </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, at the very least, is fine enough to have deserved better than being locked out in the rain.</span></p>

              <p>When you ask people to give you their junk in exchange for $5 coupons, they will happily do so. And if it’s GameStop asking they’ll apparently take it even farther, trying to pawn off sex toys, pets, and literal garbage in exchange for store credit that’s valid for other garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395">like FunkoPops</a>. The meme stock retailer’s “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” led to viral stunts and some big headaches for the people who had to work during it.</p> <p>The rules precluded customers from bringing in stuff like hazardous chemicals, medications, and certain electronics like Meta Quest headsets, but encouraged them to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582">trade in</a> bizarre paraphernalia like taxidermy animals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some people did exactly that. GameStop shared images over the weekend of what looked like <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997443240275161108">a stuffed bobcat</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997415848886362113">half-chewed goose</a>. But those weren’t the only random artifacts pawned at the gaming retailer on December 6.</p>

 <p>Other customers reportedly turned in a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997423749318979985">Netflix disc</a> for installing the streaming service on Wii, a gift-shop replica of the <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997434600021467220">Declaration of Independence</a>, and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997384530324599051">plastic spoon</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgbo5g/this_was_the_best_trade_anything_item_i_got_in/">Bizarre curios</a> that GameStop rejected included <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157">someone’s Social Security card</a> and some guy’s dog. “They said no,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR9i_07DD5K/?igsh=MTdobmNraXNzNTdyNw%3D%3D">joked</a>&nbsp;Pokémon card loot box streamer Roaring Sensei. “Exclusions include dead or alive animals,” GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623">explained</a> in response.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*Exclusions include dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). <a href="https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR">https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But while the video game chain was clout chasing on social, employees in stores had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098">manage the stunt’s awkward fallout</a>. “My trade in anything day didn’t start out bad: a few odd 3D printed items, shoes, etc., etc.,” one staffer, who said they were just hired back in September, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ph4gbi/my_trade_in_anything_day_experience/">wrote</a> on the GameStop subreddit. “I then have a man come in with a LARGE bin. filled with video games. he tells me ‘the video game store down the street told me i had too many for them so I came here.”</p>

 <p>The employee continued, “I’m not even kidding he had at LEAST a hundred games. and so I’m like ok I’m scanning the games opening them checking them out to make sure they’re correct and not scratched and…I open one…and inside is an INCREDIBLY graphic adult film disc.”</p>

 <p>Another apparent staffer said someone tried to trade in a dildo. “Had someone come to the store and they full on slapped it on the table,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg73c9/man_brings_dildo_into_store_for_trade_anything/">wrote</a>. “There were a lot of kids in the store and so I got upset and kicked him out. Well word got to my DM and apparently my RM is blaming my whole store and DM for crashing out and letting this happen.” Was the dildo used or new? They didn’t say.</p>

   <p>One customer drew a face on a leaf. GameStop declined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfstsq/i_tried_to_trade_in_my_friend_bobby_but_i_got/">that trade-in</a>. Another brought in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg7lhm/i_traded_in_a_piece_of_freaking_lint_for_5/">piece of lint</a>. GameStop did <em>not</em> decline that. “Absolutely bunkers,” the person wrote. “Lol.” Food items were also fair game as long as they weren’t immediately perishable. In fact, some stores said they were encouraging players to bring in canned goods that could easily be donated to local food drives for the holiday season. That resulted in everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfzpnn/trade_in_anything_day/">Pokémon Campbell’s soup</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgktxy/most_expensive_vienna_sausage/">Vienna Sausages</a>. Someone even got $5 store credit for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg6yai/trade_in_anything_day_success/">Tangy BBQ McDonald’s</a> sauce.</p>

 <p>But the best trade-in of all was a thank you note <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/trade_anything_day/">written on a Kirby Post-It</a>. “To the dudes @ GameStop, I hope your day has been well,” it read. “I’m sorry that they are trying to trade in garbage. That sucks and I hope no one in this area did that. I also hope you are doing well as people outside of GameStop. Stay sane and happy holidays.”</p> <p>“This is worth so much more then $5,” one staffer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/comment/nspqxs9/">wrote</a> in response. “Thank you.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-campaign-master-chief-release-date-2000651439</link>
            <guid>1376557</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is four years old, and that makes me very sad. An announcement shared today from the official </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> account on X was meant to be celebratory, but I found it depressing. How can you feel optimistic about </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> in 2025?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four years of Infinite memories, Infinite friendships, Infinite fun 🎂</p> <p>Happy birthday, Halo Infinite! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/7gxwl6ZVhH">pic.twitter.com/7gxwl6ZVhH</a></p> <p>— Halo (@Halo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1998044899262746815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is the most recent entry in the iconic Xbox franchise, and it was predictably hyped up before launch. Its open-world campaign offered a unique take on the franchise formula and seemed poised to crack open the </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> universe, with plans for it to be the central hub of new </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>content for years after its launch. But as its release date crept closer, the sixth mainline entry in the Master Chief saga strained under the pressure. A 2020 gameplay reveal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinites-campaign-finally-re-revealed-and-its-lo-1847927849"><span>unintentionally created a meme factory,</span></a><span> and a month later, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> was delayed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>finally launched in December 2021 (though the multiplayer released a few weeks earlier), and did so without split-screen co-op and Forge, the series’ map creation suite. Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) never added the additional story content we were promised—instead, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1kzbpda/the_next_master_chief_novel_halo_edge_of_dawn/"><span>it’ll be neatly tied up in a book releasing next week</span></a><span>. I held out hope that </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span> would eventually become the massive Master Chief universe we were promised, but it never did.</span></p>

 <p><span>Just last month, it was announced that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><span>studio would cease development</span></a><span> on the sci-fi shooter, shortly after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, a ground-up remake of the original game’s campaign</span></a><span>, was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though there are, reportedly, other </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> games in development at Halo Studios, the current state of the franchise is a massive bummer. </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, due out next year, may bring </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> to PS5 for the first time, and it may look damn good, but we all know it’s just a nostalgia retread of a 25-year-old game. It won’t include multiplayer, just the first game’s campaign and a few new missions. It will offer four-person co-op for the first time ever. But aside from </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, there’s no news on what to expect next from Halo Studios.</span></p>

 <p><span>So we return to </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>, the most recent game in the franchise. Sadly, </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s open-world campaign is not worth a revisit, especially without couch co-op or a continuation of Master Chief’s story (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise"><span>the story DLC was confirmed canned back in 2023</span></a><span>). </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s multiplayer has that </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> special sauce—it feels great and can be a chaotic blast, but there just aren’t that many people playing anymore. So if you’re like me and only play a handful of modes, you’ll quickly find yourself stuck in a loop: the same few maps, the same few players. You can only get sniped across one of a few Big Team Battle maps by EliteLover6969 so many times before it grows old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Plus, Xbox’s recent refusal to condemn the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>White House’s use of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> imagery</span></a><span> in its spate of racist propaganda further sours the taste in my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> is the franchise that shifted my gaming world, taking me from a casual gamer playing at her cousin’s house to a young woman buying an Xbox 360 and </span><i><span>Halo 3</span></i><span> on launch day so I could continue the story on my own. I hope it can find its footing once more, but on the fourth anniversary of </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span>, I’m mourning what could have been rather than celebrating what we got.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam</link>
            <guid>1376554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play an in-game month with most of the gameplay systems in place.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Management sim Esports Manager 2026, from developer Neurona Games and publishing platform indie.io, just released a new demo on Steam that gives an in-depth look at the systems that will be present in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you could probably guess from the name, the game puts you in the role of a manager of an esports organization and challenges you to lead it to victory. The demo focuses on the three key systems that define the gameplay: talent acquisition, management of staff and players, and match simulation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-8230edeea63e7deee47edfa8b1f742ed03bc67de-1920x1080-1764973274573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can create your own organization from scratch or take control of a real esports organization, like EternalFire, Copenhagen Wolves, M80, and GamerLegion, and additional teams will be added when the game fully releases. And with the Transfer Module, you can scout, buy, and sell players, including real-life players like <a href="https://x.com/neLendirekt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@neLendirekt</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/BanKsEsports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@BanKsEsports</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/PiNGCasts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@PiNGCasts</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/bit1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@bit1</u></a>, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has ratings in several different categories. Some define their technical gaming ability, like their skill with different weapon types or how clutch they are. Others define their personality, like leadership, amicability, and loyalty. And still others define their physical attributes, like eyesight, reaction time, and endurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be competing with other organizations for their services, negotiating contracts and building a roster that best aligns with your current goal. Timing and market conditions will affect these negotiations, so your strategy might need to change as circumstances do. And you’ll need to balance your income, expenses, and sponsorships to keep your organization from going bankrupt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-26db38347b8fcfd4dfc17bac991af74122c430ea-1920x1080-1764973296841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve built your team, you can use the Talk Module to communicate directly with your players and staff members to manage their growth, morale, and relationships. You set training plans to improve players’ skills, but you also need to keep an eye on their well-being and how they’re feeling. You don’t want to overwork them or wear them down. You’ll also need to monitor how your players and staff members feel about each other and resolve any conflicts that might come up. It’s all part of the nitty gritty of running an organization; it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be an esports team without the actual esports. Using the Simulation Module, you’ll take the team you’ve built into tournaments, where you can watch it perform in semi-3D simulated matches. Will all your hard work pay off in a tournament win? Or will it be clear you need to develop your team more? There’s no way to know until you actually see them in action. And with the Tactic Creator, you can design and test strategies that you can use during simulations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems make up the core gameplay loop of Esports Manager 2026, and about 70% of the final systems are present in the demo. The demo doesn’t limit the real-life amount of time you can play it, but it is limited to one in-game month. That’s plenty of time to go through the full process of creating your manager profile, choosing a team, building your roster, communicating with players, signing up for a tournament, and going through simulated matches.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-56e08dc15e864c548deeb239ab7187ecf86fd4b7-1920x1080-1764973253420.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While most of the core gameplay is there, the developers have also made it clear that more is on the way. In particular, match simulations will be significantly expanded and more complex, with added options for tactical control and in-game events. And, of course, everything that’s present in the demo will be further balanced and polished between now and release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the full game, the demo is meant to be replayed to test out new strategies and experience more of what it has to offer. And it should give you a pretty accurate idea of the scope of the final game. The demo is available to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749950/Esports_Manager_2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a> now, and if you want to get the latest updates, you can follow Esports Manager 2026 on <a href="https://x.com/EManagerGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/esportsmanager" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Game Awards airs this Thursday, December 11, but we now know that one of the big reveals will be related to Tomb Raider. This announcement was first revealed in Fortnite (yes, Fortnite) before the franchise’s <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148">official X account</a> shared the news to a broader audience.</p><p>The announcement consists of a piece of art (posted above) that shows a silhouette of Lara Croft atop a pedestal bearing the words "Announcement December 11”. The Tomb Raider X account then posts the following message:</p><p>As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to&nbsp;@thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider</p><p>While the announcement doesn't explicitly promise a new game reveal, it’s been known <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/04/05/crystal-dynamics-announces-new-tomb-raider-game-will-be-powered-by-unreal-engine-5">since 2022</a> that Crystal Dynamics, which has developed every mainline Tomb Raider game since 2006’s Tomb Raider: Legend, is working on a new entry in the series. At the time, the studio announced it was being developed in Unreal Engine 5, but little else is known about the project other than it will be published by Amazon Games (even after this division suffered <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">mass layoffs in October</a>). The development of the game was reportedly also unaffected by the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-an-unknown-number-of-staff">rounds of layoffs</a> that hit Crystal Dynamics in August.&nbsp;</p><p>The last mainline Tomb Raider game was 2018’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/in-the-shadow-of-something-greater">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. Since then, fans have been treated to two remastered collections of the first six games in the series: Tomb Raider I-III Remastered in 2024 and Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered earlier this year. Meanwhile, Season 2 of Netflix's <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> animated series is set to premiere on December 11 – the same day as The Game Awards.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> update! Get your The Alters update! Fresh, hot and ready to download, it's got some quality of life bits, some new features and base things like a "gamer's den", distressingly, a photo mode, and a number of other things. And now, for your pleasure, I will relay unto you in detail what these things are.
</p>
<p>
So, for starters there's a new relax mode. This isn't as fancy or in depth as it sounds, it's basically just an easier difficulty mode so you can get through the story without worrying about screwing anything up. A new save system has been introduced, which allows automatic saving upon exiting the game, alongside "crucial story moments."
</p>

<p>
There's also a whole entire card game found in the gamer's den, a new base section. Really can't tell you much about this one, it just appears briefly in the trailer for the update, so you'll have to venture in to figure out the rules for yourself. For those after some more narrative, there's a new sidestory where you have to solve a Noir-themed storyline specifically set in the gamer's den.
</p><p>
The photo mode looks like pretty much every other photo mode in the world, there's lots of filters, you can put the many Jans in different goofy poses, you know what this is already. Base customisation now allows you to change the skins of the various modules, all of which look quite ugly in the trailer to be honest. Lastly, you'll find a selection of new spacesuits so you can head out and explore "in style."
</p>
<p>
What is probably worth noting is that developer 11 bit studios did use generative AI "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">in a very limited manner</a>," so they say, in The Alters, in case you put the game down for this reason but couldn't remember why.

		<p>Never been in a situation where the heartbreak from yet another Bears loss to the Packers actually felt...good? Like, I know moral victories are what losers tell themselves to feel better at night, but honestly, the Packers are a Super Bowl contender and we took them all the way down to the final seconds and came up short.

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 On Switch 1 Impresses Digital Foundry - "Nigh-Imperceptible Dips"]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-on-switch-1-impresses-digital-foundry-nigh-imperceptible-dips</link>
            <guid>1376509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a technical showcase on Switch 2, and we're sure many of you have spent the weekend exploring Viewros on the new console over the weekend. But for those of you who are still clinging on to your Switch 1 and wondering whether Samus' brand new adventure holds up on the old system, fear not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-how-much-of-a-downgrade-is-the-switch-1-experience">Digital Foundry has taken a look</a> at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 release</a> of Metroid Prime 4 and is pretty much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">in agreement with us</a> on the surprising quality of the release. You can read their impressions on their shiny new website, or listen to the trio talk about the game on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">week's DF Direct Weekly</a> (up top).</p>
<p>Leave it to Retro Studios, hey? The game has understandably taken a hit on Switch 1, as you'd expect, but Digital Foundry says "Our resolution and frame-rate analysis tools tell a positive story for one of Switch 1's prettiest games yet." That's high praise indeed, with much of the positivity from the team coming from just <em>what</em> the developers have managed to squeeze out of the old system.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fa8b9bf578d87"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond comparison Digital Foundry" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa8b9bf578d87/metroid-prime-4-beyond-comparison-digital-foundry.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Prime 4 on Switch 1 is the solid 60fps performance, which Digital Foundry feels confident enough to say"we classify this as a 'locked 60fps' game on all Switch consoles." The only drops the folks note are a handful in the open-world bike sections, and they're extremely few and far between.</p>
<p>Even though image quality takes a hit — pixel count is around "504p for geometry, 576p for Samus' visor", which is lower than 2023's Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch — there's a lot more going on here. While the pixels might be lower, the level-of-detail in the environment, shadows, and particular effects are "seemingly identical" to the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>So that cut in pixel count and visual smoothness is to allow Retro to still give the full experience to players on the older consoles. You'll be missing some detail and smoothness, and you'll have to put up with worse texture filtering, an apparent lack of anti-aliasing, and fuzzy, jagged edges and textures in places. But it's an impressive experience on the Switch 1, all the same.</p>

<p>Heck, we said so ourselves last week: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version is <em>the</em> version to get, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4">Digital Foundry were full of praise for that release</a>. You're getting a good game regardless of where you're playing it, essentially.</p>

<p>It's been a long wait for fans of the best-selling videogame heroine of all time, as certified recently by the Guinness World Records. Historic franchise developer Crystal Dynamics acted only as a support studio for the final entry in the reboot trilogy, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which was developed by sister studio Eidos Montréal and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in September 2018</a>. The studio was focusing on Marvel's Avengers at the time, which launched two years later and turned out to be a big flop despite the massive IP attached to the game.</p>



<p>In April 2022, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was already working on a new Tomb Raider game and also revealed that it would move away from its proprietary Foundation Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Since then, we learned that Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would publish the game</a>. Amazon later purchased the movie and TV rights as well, and rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that they would like to create an interconnected universe across all these entertainment mediums.</p>



<p>As for details on the game itself, we have only a <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly dated rumor</a> (from May 2024) that mentions an Indian setting and an open world map that would allow Lara to roam with her motorcycle. </p>



<p>The TV series recently got Lara Croft's actress: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. The show will be filmed next year and is likely to launch at some point in 2027. However, gamers are certainly hoping to play the next Tomb Raider title in 2026, as it has been long enough already.</p>

            <guid>1376500</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week ended with a bombshell report for the entertainment industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/">with Netflix submitting a bid to purchase Warner Bros Discovery Streaming and Studios,</a> which includes HBO Max, HBO, and all of the film, television, and game development studios under Warner Bros for a whopping $82.7 billion. Now, Paramount Skydance has upped the ante with its own bid of $108.4 billion to try and steal the acquisition out from under Netflix's nose.</p>



<p>Of course, whether it'll be successful or not is a different story, but there are a few key differences between Paramount's offer and what Netflix had offered that make the whole ordeal quite interesting. One notable aspect is that, unlike Netflix, which just wants to acquire the Streaming and Studios branch of Warner Bros, Paramount wants the whole kit and caboodle.</p>



<p>Which is to say that Paramount would look to entirely acquire Warner Bros, including the Global Linear Networks branch as well as the Streaming and Studios branch. Paramount is also offering an all-cash deal, paying $30 per share instead of Netflix's offer to pay $27.5 per share. This is also a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount, which is why the company is taking it "<em>directly to shareholders</em>," as Ellison says, compared to Netflix's bid, which Warner Bros Discovery is already aligned with.</p>



<p>Paramount's press release even adds that it submitted six different proposals to Warner Bros Discovery over the course of 12 weeks, each of them privately rejected by Warner Bros executives, going so far as to say that Warner Bros "<em>never engaged meaningfully</em>" with Paramount's six attempts. Paramount is very clearly trying to win over shareholders, framing its proposal as the "<em>clearly superior</em>" one shareholders would not have seen if Paramount had not gone public with it.</p>



<p>"<em>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company</em>," said David Ellison, chief executive officer and chairman of Paramount, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">in a press release</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</em>"</p>



<p>Not only does Paramount believe its offer to be the better one compared to Netflix's, it believes that Paramount acquiring Warner Bros Discovery has a better chance of getting approved than Netflix acquiring Warner Bros Discovery.</p>



<p>"<em>Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice</em>," the press release reads. "<em>In contrast, the Netflix transaction is predicated on the unrealistic assumption that its anticompetitive combination with WBD, which would entrench its monopoly with a 43% share of global Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) subscribers, could withstand multiple protracted regulatory challenges across the world. In many European Union countries the Netflix transaction would combine the dominant SVOD player with the number two or strong number three competitor. The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors. Netflix has never undertaken large-scale acquisitions, resulting in increased execution risk which WBD shareholders would have to endure.</em>"</p>



<p>Ellison added that he and Paramount believe allowing Paramount to acquire Warner Bros Discovery would lead to "<em>a stronger Hollywood</em>," and that Paramount acquiring WBD, not Netflix, "<em>is in the best interest of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry</em>."</p>



<p>It is a proper bidding war now, with both Netflix and Paramount in the ring with such incredibly high bids. Either acquisition, if accepted, would set a new record for the largest acquisition in history. Either one will also entirely change the entertainment landscape, should they go through.</p>



<p>It'll be a long time before that happens, though, as there will be a drawn-out regulatory process before either acquisition makes it over the line. Either way, the 2020s have been a massive time of change for Warner Bros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/">after its split in 2021</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">restructuring of its video game business</a>, and now the coming conclusion of this acquisition process, whether it ends up under Paramount or Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board game publisher Kosmos has announced a new game coming in 2026. That game, titled <em>Perfect Murder</em>, is a competitive experience about detectives, serial killers, and murder.</p><h2>The <em>Perfect Murder</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>Kosmos announced the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game through an official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcfdgnjSMV/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Instagram post</a>. The post showed an image of the game's box, and a release date of 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The text in the post, written in both German and English, does contain extra information. It is a competitive, two-player experience. One player is the murderer; the other player is the detective. The murderer must perform the perfect crime, leaving false trails and red herrings along the way. The detective must uncover the truth and bring the killer to justice.</p><p>The last part of the post provides some insight into the nature of the core gameplay. The section states the following:</p><blockquote><p>With nine suspects, twelve weapons, and eight rooms, a new case unfolds every time. Bluffing, deduction, and clever deduction make each game a thrilling adventure.</p></blockquote><p>In context, it appears the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game may be a more asymmetric experience. The presence of multiple suspects, weapons, and rooms implies that the game may be a more involved version of the iconic board game Clue, one where another player tries to stump the other with a convoluted murder plan. This would parse with the social elements of bluffing, deception, and critical thinking at the end.</p><p>Kosmos is known for modestly budgeted, small box experiences. Their work includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-theft-on-mississippi-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Exit</em></a> series, which is a collection of escape room challenges, the <em>Masters of Crime</em> series, the personalized city builder, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-city-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>My City</em></a>, and even board game adaptations of management games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cities-skylines-board-game-announced-by-kosmos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cities Skylines</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/anno-1800-board-game-coming-in-fall-2020" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Anno 1800</em>.</a> With this in mind, there's a high chance a copy of Perfect Murder won't break the bank.</p><p>As for when this competitive game of killers and detectives will hit store shelves, we will need time to gather more clues.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1376491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> the latest main entry in Nintendo’s <em>Metroid</em> franchise, is finally here after nearly a decade of waiting. Now available on Switch and Switch 2,<em> Prime 4</em> might not be the best game in the series, but it offers up plenty of great levels to explore and aliens to shoot. But before you hop into this new adventure, we have some tips to help you save the day.</p> <h2>Make sure you smash plenty of green crystals!</h2> <p>While exploring the Sol Valley desert in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4,</em></a> you’ll spot lots of green crystals. These can be smashed with your motorcycle and collected. The game tells you to do this, and you really, really should. Not only do you get some upgrades when you bring these crystals back to your base camp, but you’ll hopefully not have to grind much later to finish <em>Prime 4</em> if you collect gems now. You need a lot before the game lets you start the final mission, and I didn’t have enough, so I had to drive around for like 30 minutes collecting more. Don’t be like me! Smash those crystals whenever you see them.</p>

 <h2>Change the morph ball jump button ASAP</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651425">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For some strange reason (and it was like this in <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> as well)<em>&nbsp;Prime 4</em> includes two different jump buttons when you first boot it up: One for Samus in her standard human form and one for when you are in her Morph Ball form. Thankfully, after digging through some menus, you can change this to one button and I recommend doing that as soon as the game allows. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021">Here’s a quick, handy guide on how to do that!</a></p>

 <h2>Mash the A button to (possibly) skip cutscenes</h2> <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> includes some fantastic cutscenes. It also contains a lot of filler-y cutscenes that you’ll see over and over again as Samus transitions to different areas. Thankfully, you can skip these. You do have to wait for the game to finish loading before you can skip these, and it doesn’t tell you when that happens. On Switch 2 at least, I found load times to be fast and got into a habit of mashing the A button during transitional cutscenes so I could end them the moment loading wrapped up.</p>

 <h2>Scan stuff and then scan more stuff!</h2> <p>This is a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, so I probably don’t need to tell most people to scan items and enemies, but in case this is your first rodeo: Scan everything. Often, these scans can reveal clues as to how a door is open or a puzzle completed. Some enemies even contain info on how to defeat them faster.</p>

 <h2>When stuck, try everything</h2> <p><em>Prime 4</em> does a pretty good job of not making its puzzles too obtuse. But there were still moments where I was left scratching my head as to what to do next. When this happened, I would follow a very simple rule: Try everything, starting with the most recent ability I unlocked. Even if it seems silly to use a bomb or missile or charged blast or whatever on that lock or item, give it a shot. If you do this, you’ll likely find the solution in no time.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651426">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Freeze enemies</h2> <p>While you get access to multiple elemental blasts in<em> Prime 4,</em> my favorite ended up being the ice shot, as it freezes most enemies in place for a few seconds, which can help a lot when you get ambushed by tough aliens. It also makes flying enemies fall out of the sky, which can be very useful in some parts of <em>Prime 4</em>. Oh, and make sure you use the ice shot on fire-themed enemies to quickly take them out.</p> <h2>Mark stuff on your map</h2> <p>As you explore the various levels and the desert in <em>Prime 4</em>, you’ll likely encounter doors you can’t open or things you can’t interact with yet until you get a specific ability. These moments aren’t a waste of time, however, as<em> Prime 4</em> lets you mark these areas on your map using a few different icons. This can be very helpful when, hours later, you want to go back to that scout bot or locked door but don’t remember where it was.</p>

            <guid>1376473</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At their biggest and most expensive, video games all sort of look the same. The reason often comes down to simple economics: More resources means more costs that need to be recouped, and historically the way publishers have done that is by being comically risk-averse. Hence the glut of semi-realistic rocky wastelands that look like death metal album covers where everyone is some kind of Wild West fetishist, or the hero shooters that all look like Pixar but shredded as hell and ready for fan artists to go places I shall not.</p><p>On occasion, however, new visual ground is staked. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is an example of this. The third game in the <em>Octopath </em>series is a lot of things — a newcomer-friendly prequel, a reconfigured adaptation of a mobile game, a pretty great JRPG — but it’s also the end of a 2025 victory lap for the art style that publisher Square Enix has dubbed “HD-2D.” It’s a bold experiment that is now a fixture of the release calendar — and also highly unusual in how much it communicates. An HD-2D game from Square Enix is a statement about what old games it considers classics worth revisiting, and what new games should be received as such.</p><p>“The HD-2D style began with the idea: ‘What if we revived games from the Super Famicom, the golden era of pixel art, using modern technology?’” Masaaki Hayasaka, producer of this year’s <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, told <em>The Verge </em>via email. First used in 2018’s<em> Octopath Traveler</em>, the art style is meant to evoke the pixelated texture and feel that characterized 16-bit role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, but with the depth and detail afforded by modern 3D graphics. The developers at Square and <em>Octopath</em> co-developer Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">cleverly achieved this</a> using Unreal Engine, which allowed them to render — and, crucially, <em>light</em> — <em>Octopath</em> like any modern game, placing 2D characters that looked ripped from a CRT screen in a world designed to look great on a modern screen. The hope was that, as a new role-playing franchise debuting on the then-new Nintendo Switch, <em>Octopath Traveler</em> would immediately be seen as both thoroughly modern in its design, but also classic in a way that courted nostalgia-prone gamers.</p><p>It worked. After the sales success of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-travelers-hd2d-is-now-a-square-enix-trademark">trademarked the “HD-2D” name</a> (but not the style), a signal of commitment to its new aesthetic paradigm. Then a funny thing happened: The next two HD-2D games from Square were not <em>Octopath </em>sequels, but the tactics RPG <em>Triangle Strategy</em> and a remake of 1994’s <em>Live a Live</em>, one of the most highly acclaimed Super Famicom RPGs to never get an official English-language release. Both released in 2022, these games are where HD-2D stops becoming a novel quirk and more of a design ethos for the publisher. An HD-2D game either seeks to be the ultimate pastiche via original titles like <em>Octopath</em>, distilling an era’s worth of hits into a crisp new package, or it is a loving re-creation of a game that deserves a new day in the sun.</p><div><p>“There lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style”</p></div><p>The pattern holds: <em>Octopath</em> and its sequels continue to be the only original HD-2D titles in the SNES-era JRPG style, with <em>Triangle Strategy</em> holding down the tactics game end and next year’s <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> seeking to do the same for Zelda-style action RPGs. On the remake front, Square Enix has released <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> with great ceremony, following last year’s take on <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. (The backward release order reflects the order Square prefers players play them in.)</p><p>In both contexts, HD-2D has largely been a hit with critics — or at least, critics predisposed to playing the games they all lovingly homage. “It’s a gorgeous style that goes beyond a pure retro look to create something timeless,” writes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg/"><em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh</a> in praise of <em>Live a Live</em>’s use of the style, “an extension of a classic ’90s video game aesthetic into the present, which deepens and enriches it whilst staying faithful to its original character.” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review">Many</a> <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/">reviews</a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey">of</a> <em>Octopath Traveler</em> or its sequel call the games “beautiful” or “gorgeous.” Square Enix’s stated goal of pioneering a visual language that does the tricky work of being nostalgic and modern at the same time seems to be a resounding success.</p><p>“Perhaps some players may view games with pixel art as something old,” said <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>producer Hirohito Suzuki, who also spoke to <em>The Verge </em>via email. “But there lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style — and there are no limits to one’s imagination.”</p><p>Of course, there’s a fun little cheat here, one that the <em>Octopath </em>developers noted when describing the development process for a 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZk-wiwxpU0&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unrealengine.com%2F">Unreal Engine promo video</a>. It’s that the HD-2D look owes just as much to PlayStation-era titles like <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Grandia</em> as it does the Super Nintendo games, making the style a much wider synthesis (and perhaps less novel) than it is frequently billed as. That is, however, no reason to sell it short — Square continues to demonstrate surprising variety with its HD-2D titles. According to Hayasaka, understanding how much leeway the HD-2D approach affords is crucial to its successful implementation.</p><p>“The definition of HD-2D is actually very simple, and if you create characters and monsters as pixel art and place them on top of a 3D background, that alone technically works,” Hayasaka said. “Of course, this alone wouldn’t capture the HD-2D-like quality, so from there, you’d sort everything from the color palette, effects, and camera to firmly create that ‘atmosphere that feels right.’ That’s incredibly important and is the crux of HD-2D games. So, I believe the secret to success for any HD-2D project lies in having an art director who could grasp that feeling and sensibility.”</p><div><p>“None of the five titles released so far look exactly the same”</p></div><p>The original HD-2D efforts like <em>Octopath</em> and <em>Triangle Strategy </em>are ironically the least visually expansive, hewing to similar muted color palettes and papercraft diorama-like staging. Colors make or break these games, as overreliance on any one range of shades will threaten to flatten the planes and jeopardize the illusion of depth. These shortcomings are made up for by astounding visual crescendos where light illuminates a scene in a way that feels frankly impossible. The remakes are more colorful. The <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are downright maximalist in a way that barely bothers to evoke pixelated landscapes, leaning more on the “HD” side of “HD-2D” and the strength of Akira Toriyama’s distinctive character and monster designs. They create an opulent backdrop for the simplicity of a master cartoonist’s work, and the result is equally, if not more, affecting.</p><p>“Even under the umbrella of HD-2D, none of the five titles released so far look exactly the same,” Hayasaka said. “There are countless ways to broaden the changes made between them, from the color palette to how much of the pixels’ grainy texture you bring out. That’s why I believe it’s an expression method that still has plenty of room to grow.”</p><p>“Timeless” is another word that’s used a lot in relation to HD-2D, in a way that speaks to its success and carefully considered deployment. The aesthetic is one born from insecurity — the developers at Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">initially wanted to make a classic 2D pixel-art game</a>, but were worried that it wouldn’t be seen as sufficiently modern. That conflict is one of the core tensions of video games, the push and pull between artistic expression and technological progress. Art is a moment captured in time, of the time it’s made even if poised to transcend it.</p><p>Games, however, are also tied to their technological moment, and technology can be embarrassing. Pixel art smudged to hell by 4K monitors, dialogue rendered oblique or childish because of memory limitations, music made for limited sound chips awkwardly filling 5.1 surround sound speakers. More than most other art forms, the makers of games must decide: Should limitations be preserved, or forgotten? Are compromises made for tech’s sake enduring artistic choices, or temporary acts of pragmatism?</p><p>The beautiful delusion of HD-2D is in thinking that there might be a way to craft a perfect version of a game that can survive the ravages of time. A way of rendering a game that is reverent to the past but not embarrassing to the future. Flattering to the history of games but also our modern sensibilities, which prize convenience and ample “quality-of-life” features. There is, however, no escaping these questions. We will age and change, as will technology and our relation to it. It is beautiful to try and transcend this, and it is beautiful to fail, as most of us will. Video games all look the same, until they do not.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>







<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-full-warner-bros-discovery-statement-on-the-offer">Full Warner Bros. Discovery Statement On The Offer</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (“Warner Bros. Discovery” or “WBD”) (NASDAQ: WBD) today confirmed Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount Skydance”) (NASDAQ: PSKY) has commenced an unsolicited tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors (the “Board”), consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”).</p>



<p>The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance’s tender offer within 10 business days.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery stockholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance’s proposal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death Howl Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/</link>
            <guid>1376446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One thing that we all have in common is death. Through our lives we inevitably lose people we love, and then one day it will be our turn. A morbid thought, but one that came to mind a few times while playing Death Howl. This a game about a mother, Ro, who is overcome with grief after the death of her son. She is not ready to let death claim him, so she travels to the spirit realm to find him and bring him back to her.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Howl | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7J4c7mzP2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Howl is a roguelike deck builder where you are craft cards and create different decks to help you battle through the four regions of the spirit realm. There are five sets of cards, from the realmless cards that can be used in any region without penalty to the four-region card sets that have unique cards to deal with the challenges each one has for the player. You can mix and match cards for your decks, but using a card outside of its region incurs a penalty and uses up more mana to play them.</p>



<p>It is an interesting system, but the downside is the time it can take to grind out progress to make new cards. This is because of the Howls, the resource used to create both cards and teardrops. Howls are gathered by defeating enemies, but they can be lost by falling in battle and not retrieving them in time, in soulslike fashion. Once you have enough, you have a choice to craft cards where you are with howls and crafting materials to build your deck, or travel to a Sacred Grove to spend the howls to create teardrops which gives Ro new skills that can provide advantages. Sacred Groves also restore health at the cost of resetting enemy encounters. This does add an element of tactical decision making, but it also means grinding quite a lot too.</p>

<p>Aside from region cards, there are also region specific upgrades which means you need hundreds of howls to get all of the cards and abilities, so you will be repeating fights to get them. If you find a nest you may be rewarded with a teardrop which helps, but it may have been better to have two separate resources for cards and abilities.</p>

<p>Death Howl’s combat takes place on a grid, with each arena being a different size and shape depending on its location in the world. When Ro steps onto a grid you can choose a starting square, or walk off before battle commences, with the enemies already in place. Once you pick your starting square you are locked into the fight, only ending once you defeat the enemies, or die trying.</p>
<p>Battles in Death Howl play out in a similar fashion. Ro and enemies take turns to move around the grid and perform actions. There are various enemy types that can have a basic version and a more powerful version. Battles are about trial and error as you work out how far enemies can move, what attacks they can use, and their weaknesses. Even when you know how an enemy works there is a challenge on dealing with the way they act which can quickly switch a fight. One boss fight saw the boss summoning allies every few turns which eventually overwhelmed me because my deck was not good enough. That meant going back out into the world and grinding some more. You can fast travel around the world using Sacred Groves once you have unlocked them, so you can skip some encounters if you want to.</p>
<p>Your card deck has 20 cards which will appear in your hand regularly, unless they have an exhaust clause meaning they can only be used once. Cards provide melee attacks, ranged attacks, defence options, and buffs. Putting a good deck together is key as you want cards that work well together to allow for a good balance of attack and defence options.</p>

<p>On top of cards, you will also find Totems in the world. Totems provide additional bonuses, though can come at a cost. For example, the Beehive totem gives you extra mana but adds a bee sting to your card pile, while the pearl will provide additional defence but at the cost of discarding a card each turn.</p>
<p>Death Howl’s world is open to explore so you can visit the different regions in the order you want to, so you don’t end up getting stuck in one place. Aside from Ro’s main quest to find her son’s spirit, there are other quests to take up in the world. Taking one up can mean getting quest cards, and being equipped with these means you cannot fast travel. What I found a bit of a strange decision was how these cards work. If you choose not to have these cards equipped, they will return to their point of origin, instead of being put in their own inventory slot. On one hand it means you can’t use these cards in other quests, apart from the main one while you have them, but it means Death Howl forces you to go back to a quest location to reactivate it. It seems like unnecessary busy work.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, the world of Death Howl looks good with the various regions having a distinct style to them. The starting area is quite a dark and moody woodland but has you venture further out you will find desert like areas, to areas where rivers are flowing. I like the way it has been designed and how each region transitions into each other pretty smoothly. The card inventory UI could be better to show how many of each card you have, and making it easier to read card descriptions. At the moment, it feels a bit fiddly working out what a card does especially with different abilities attached that also need explaining. The card designs are well done though with the artwork being very good.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/11-bit-shares-a-frostpunk-1886-release-window-as-dlc-drops-for-frostpunk-2/</link>
            <guid>1376443</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>11 Bit Studios has shared an update on the development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-1886">Frostpunk 1886</a>, the reimagining of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game, which is now aiming for a 2027 release. That’s in addition to the first DLC launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Frostpunk 1886. with Game Director Maciej Sułecki sharing some behind the scenes glimpses of what it will entail.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | Developer Update | Digital Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CcZfqQ8kws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 is a remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">the original game</a> within Unreal Engine, but it’s more than just a graphical uplift, with 11 Bit working to expand the game with new mechanics and content. Sułecki highlights the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing citizen behavior through improved animations and motion capture</li>
<li>Adding more expressive slices of daily life in New London</li>
<li>A redesigned lighting system emphasizing the harshness of the Frostland</li>
<li>Upgraded building textures for a more grounded, immersive city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, this is all still a good long way away, with “about two years” to go, according to Sułecki, confirming a 2027 release target.</p>

<p>So it’s a good thing that there’s another Frostpunk game that’s been released fairly recently, isn’t it? 11 Bit has today released the Fractured Utopias DLC for Frostpunk 2, its first expansion, which improves the Utopia Builder Mode. This is available now for both PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">console versions</a> of the game. It comes alongside an update that also includes from free content.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Tomb Raider to be Revealed at The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1376428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>







<p>What do you think the future of Tomb Raider will look like? Excited to see it at The Game Awards? Do you think it’ll be like the reboots? Originals?

Only one Infinity Blade spawned each match, and lobbies turned into an absolute mess over who nabbed the game-breaking item first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I remember enjoying the brief disruption to the game's meta, which was turned on its head and has never seen anything quite like it since (perhaps for good reason). Because, after significant outcry, the Infinity Blade was made unplayable and literally frozen into its pedestal after only a few days, never to be used again — until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has not said when it intends to unvault the Infinity Blade, or for how long. It's possible the weapon will be offered at full strength for a brief period, or it could have been rebalanced — for now, players have been left to speculate. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/download-1765214757064.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite OG's Chapter 1 Season 7 announcement.

Fresh areas of the map include Polar Peak — home to the Ice King, the cheery Happy Hamlet and the Frosty Flights airbase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remixed outfits include the feline-tailed Lynx (later the love interest for swole cat Meowscles), onesie-wearing character Onesie, and Fortnite's battle-scarred take on Father Christmas himself: Sergeant Winter. Is the game really giving up its opportunity to reskin The Ice King? For now, it seems so — though rumors have suggested we may be seeing more of him in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is, as always, a busy time for Fortnite — which recently launched its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-art-teases-lego-ninjago-fans-say-and-return-of-the-cube">big new Chapter 7 update for the game's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes</a>.
