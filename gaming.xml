<p>Both companies deny the claims</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/828e1a69f9b85/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you found yourself trying to pick up a Switch 2 across the pond in recent months, then it will be old news to you that the console, and many first-party games prior to it, was not available <em>directly</em> through Amazon US. It felt like a baffling omission, but a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) might give some explanation of why this was the case — even if the two companies involved have denied it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg spoke to "a person familiar with the situation" to try to get to the bottom of why Amazon US missed out on hosting Nintendo sales of its own, and it reportedly all comes down to a sales dispute between the companies around how the online storefront handles its third-party sellers.</p>
<p>According to the report, Nintendo pulled Amazon US' official sales privileges after clocking that "unauthorised sales" were appearing on the site, undercutting Nintendo's prices. The anonymous source claimed that select sellers were bulk-buying Nintendo products in Southeast Asia, before flogging them at a reduced rate on Amazon US.</p>
<p>The storefront apparently offered to attach labels guaranteeing a product's authenticity, but Nintendo instead opted to pull all of its official sales from the site, leaving only those sold by third parties.</p>
<p>Now, as we said right from the jump, both Nintendo and Amazon US deny these claims. "There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers," a Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg. The Amazon spokesperson similarly stated that "the claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate," though there are no specifics about <em>how</em> they are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Last year, it appeared that Nintendo's so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/amazon-appears-to-be-directly-selling-first-party-switch-games-again-us">"freeze-out" of Amazon US was coming to an end</a>, as copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> began to crop up on the site with Amazon listed as the seller. But months on, very little seems to have changed. You can still find first-party Nintendo products a-plenty on regional Amazon stores like the UK, Canadian, and Japanese sites, but the lion's share of US listings still come from third-party sellers.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, you're still better off braving the likes of Best Buy, Target, GameStop and Walmart in the US if you want to ensure the Nintendo guarantee.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-ceos-pay-rises-yet-again-after-disappointing-year.1232811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay rose yet again this year, despite the fact that two of the studio's biggest releases were flops and despite overall median employee pay falling.</p>

<p>According to an EA proxy filing (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>), Wilson raked in $31 million last year, including "cash and stock awards", as Game File puts it. Wilson's pay this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">marks a major increase</a> over last year's, so clearly, EA thinks he's doing something right.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;EA Sports FC 25</i>, two of EA's tentpole releases last year, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">financial disappointments</a> for the company, although in fairness, March's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">pretty unqualified success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=S9QddC2E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=cIBknmsV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay went up this year, despite major flops like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As Game File's Stephen Totilo points out, Wilson's payrise also happened in direct contrast to median pay for EA employees, which fell last year, because of course it did. In 2023, median employee pay was $149,000 per annum, but the year after, that figure had fallen to $117,000.</p>

<p>However, as Totilo says, EA's metrics for employee pay are somewhat obfuscated, which makes their reporting a little imprecise.</p>

<p>The figure refers to "the same median employee" as the company used in previous years to report the aforementioned figure, which is slightly confusing phrasing, and the total also includes bonuses and stock grants, as Wilson's does.</p>

<p>Still, it's a little galling that in an industry where employees' jobs seem <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">constantly on the line</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">nowhere</a> does that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">appear more true</a> than at EA), Wilson can still be making money hand over fist in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=XLqtuIWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=atc5q7g_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA employees' median pay has fallen in the last couple of years.</figcaption></figure><p>Game File's chart demonstrating just how much higher Wilson's pay is than the median employee figure is pretty alarming, and it's worth looking at if you want to feel angry (and why wouldn't you?).</p>

<p>News of Wilson's payrise also comes just a few weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">the cancellation</a> of EA's&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game, as well as the shutdown of the studio making said game. One rather wonders if some of the money allocated to Wilson's bonus couldn't have gone towards saving that project and the jobs associated with it, but I guess I'm not a corporate exec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>I recently traveled to New York for another <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay">hands-on session</a> with the upcoming Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bananza. Before I was handed a controller, Nintendo vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen introduced the title remotely via the Switch 2's GameChat feature. During his statements, he confirmed one key piece of Donkey Kong Bananza information fans have been speculating on since its April 2 reveal: the development team behind the game.</p><p>As many people speculated based on the design, visual aesthetic, and UI of Donkey Kong Bananza, the same team that produced Super Mario Odyssey in 2017 is also responsible for Donkey Kong Bananza. Though Nintendo often delivers high-quality titles, Super Mario Odyssey was one of the highest-reviewed games of 2017, earning a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/super_mario_odyssey/b/switch/archive/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review.aspx" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3142df2-3537-42de-920b-29e35d4728ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical">9.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em></a><em>, </em>which has given that team a particularly strong reputation<em>. </em>However, it's been nearly eight years since the release of Super Mario Odyssey, and fans have been speculating about when we can expect a new release from this team.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing it's that team undoubtedly instills a sense of confidence from the fanbase, but it also raises the question of when we'll see another 3D Super Mario game. It's entirely possible another team is working on the next 3D Mario game, or even that the next 3D Mario game was developed in parallel with Donkey Kong Bananza. While Donkey Kong Bananza certainly plays like a Super Mario Odyssey successor, longtime fans of Nintendo's flagship franchise may have a bit longer to wait before Mario is back in action. Still, for those excited for Donkey Kong Bananza, this is undoubtedly good news for the quality ceiling of the first 3D DK platformer in more than a quarter-century.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17.

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the development team behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, revealing that the game is coming from Nintendo EPD Tokyo, the same studio and team as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Further details on who the game director or lead designers are have not been confirmed at this time, but this is an indication of just how highly Nintendo regards this game to put it in the hands of such a revered team. That DK Bananza is coming out right around the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, just over six weeks after, also makes this game hugely important as a launch window exclusive.</p>


<p>Given how tight-lipped Nintendo usually is over their development teams, and who is working on what games, this will actually only increase speculation over when we might expect to see the next Mario-led 3D platformer. Since the release of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, the only other 3D Mario action that we’ve seen was the Bowser’s Fury expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">the Switch port of Super Mario 3D World in 2021</a>. At the time, this was seen by many as being a potential glimpse of the next era of Mario platformer… but that wait could be lengthened if the whole studio is working on DK Bananza, without the workforce having been split to foster multiple game concepts.</p>
<p>Still, this greatly increases the expectations that we all have for Donkey Kong Bananza. We said, of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, “[It] is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo play with new ideas while also paying homage to their long&nbsp;history. Cappy’s abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario’s own, and there’s a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting&nbsp;kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner.&nbsp;Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece.”</p>

<p>I’ve also been hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">an extended preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, saying “while some elements like just how chaotic and frenzied the screen can get while digging with complete abandon still feel a little unlike Nintendo, playing for longer reveals a lot more of what this team are trying to do and how the inventiveness that’s been a core part of this studio’s games for so long can really shine through.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip.1232772/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo has a real knack for testing my attention span. I felt it in the subtask-filled Hyrule of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but, far more importantly for this preview, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> that most effectively bombarded me with distractions. Even a simple 'Walk to that giant building in New Donk City' would quickly turn into a three-hour parkour sesh to find a Moon nowhere near my assigned objective, followed by a journey down a manhole cover, through some girders and any other way I could think of that <em>wasn't</em> towards the mission icon that silently judged me from the side of the screen.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the Odyssey team has seemingly done it again — and yes, we now know for sure that this <em>is</em> Nintendo EPD (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">or "the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a>). At a recent hands-on preview, I was lucky enough to play the upcoming platformer for around three hours, and I feel like I hardly scratched the surface, which is ironic, considering this is a game all about scratching, punching, digging and kicking surfaces. Donkey Kong Bananza has the hallmarks of an all-timer, and I can't wait to dive back in and see all the <em>kongtent</em> (sorry) I missed.</p>
<p>If you've somehow avoided the marketing for this one so far, allow me to provide a brief refresher. This is DK's first 3D platformer since the controversial collectathon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and it sees Nintendo's prized primate on a journey to the centre of the planet, in hot pursuit of the banana-pinching Void Co. He's joined on this downward dig by Pauline — yep, <em>that</em> Pauline — a 13-year-old singer-turned-purple rock who assumes Diddy Kong's usual position of back companion to the great ape, and can assist with her musical talents.</p>

<p>DK's abilities are a little more destructive than singing. He can punch, rip off chunks of the environment, and climb just about any surface in front of him. Each level is almost entirely destructible, too, so you'll be relying on these moves to uncover secret collectibles, alternative paths, and challenge courses that are scattered around the layers. DK's also got some the freaky Bananza Transformations, which mutate him into a different jacked-up jungle inhabitant and grant him a sweet new ability in the process, like improved strength, speed, or flight.</p>
<p>I explored three of the game's starting levels and a later Forest sublevel in my preview, each of which presented me with a very simple challenge, outlined by a yellow exclamation mark. It might have been to follow the music in Ingot Isle, remove a giant Void Co. lock that was plugging up the water supply in the Lagoon, or head to the mine in the Canyon Layer, but immediately, my Odyssey distraction radar started tingling.</p>
<p>Sure, I <em>could</em> head to the mine, but what happens when I punch through this wall? Why is that pile of Bomb Rocks so close to that clearly bombable doorway? Within minutes, that yellow icon was pushed to the back of my mind, and I was off digging for a nearby Banandium Gem (Bananza's equivalent to Odyssey's Power Moons) or trying to leap to a faraway island that appeared temptingly <em>just</em> within reach.</p>

<p>Being a timed session, I was eventually told to stop mucking about and get back to the critical path, but every time I tried to, something else would catch my eye and I'd be back down the rabbit hole. After exploring the Lagoon for roughly one hour, I took a quick glance at the map — which neatly updates with your real-time destruction — and saw that I had ticked off but a fraction of what the layer had to offer. What's more, every time I gave a cursory glance around the room, where a group of other journalists were mining through the same level, every screen displayed a different location that I had yet to stumble across.</p>
<p>The exploration potential is quite the beefy banana, and every locale I saw was dripping with enough charm to make the journey feel worthwhile. DK is as expressive as they come (photo mode is going to be a blast) and his cutscene reactions got more than a fair share of chuckles from me.</p>
<p>But after I had finished ogling at his ever-shimmering fur coat and its transition from wet to dry, I was more than happy to sit back and soak in the visuals. The textures are dreamy, the lighting is ace, and everything is presented with such an attention to detail that it's hard to shake the feeling that Bananza was spawned from a place of absolute love for the character. Whether it's in the big-eyed, weird NPCs that looked like they've walked in off a Rare drawing board, or the side-scrolling 'Challenge Course' extras that had me moaning about mine carts and bad-mouthing blast barrels as if I was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> fresher all over again.</p>
<p>DK's iconic movement is back in full force, too. He still packs his signature roll, and the climbing, Turf Surf and Transformation-specific abilities like Ostrich Bananza's Flutter make exploring each stage a breeze. It didn't feel quite as deep as Mario's Cappy moveset, but an in-menu skill tree teased that there is an arsenal of slick skills at DK's disposal, all you have to do is unlock them.</p>

<p>That said, at no point did Bananza feel like a game for the hardcore only. The challenge is there for those who want it, and I saw DK bite the dust many-a time, but the option to follow the critical path and <em>not</em> dive into all the digging and terraforming is a perfectly valid one too. In fact, the co-op feels made for this experience. While the wonderful <em>Alex-from-Nintendo-Life-here</em> and I made a mean DK and Pauline team, the mode will be much better suited for those who want to play with a little one in tow, letting them bark out commands, pick up collectibles and attack enemies with Pauline in Mouse Mode, while you focus on the slightly more intense monkey business.</p>
<p>My biggest reservation after going hands-on with the game at the Switch 2 Experience back in April was its performance, and while I was pleased to see that things had definitely swung in the right direction in the months since, I couldn't help but notice a couple of small issues remained. The camera still has a nasty habit of getting a little sticky when smashing up walls down under, the frame rate wobbles in certain inconsequential instances like opening the map, and, on a couple of occasions, the sky itself took on an earthy hue when DK stood awkwardly on the threshold between a cliff face and a freshly-dug tunnel.</p>

<p>But not one of the issues troubled the DK-sized grin on my face. It felt like a bit of a TOTK situation, where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition — and yeah, a game where you can <em>seamlessly</em> move in any direction, at any time, no matter what stands in your way feels like it's earned the right to a little hiccup every now and then.</p>
<p>I should also clarify that we were told our game build still isn't finalised, so there's every chance that things will be that bit smoother come launch day. Fingers crossed, at least.</p>
<p>As my three-hour session came to an end and I emerged, blinking into the sunlight, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just played something special. In its top-notch visuals, silky smooth movement and wealth of distractions, Donkey Kong Bananza is showing all the signs of becoming DK's greatest outing to date. Heck, it might even end up as a Nintendo all-timer, assuming those technical mishaps can stay as inconsequential as they seem to be. Watch out, completionists, your next obsession might be right around the corner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-unearths-the-franchise%E2%80%99s-roots-and-rips-them-out.1232769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Several moments of my two-hour hands-on preview of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> felt like I was playing the gritty 2009 action game <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em> — except this time I was actually playing as a gorilla. For example, I had to level a multistory building during a timed minigame. Just like in <em>Guerilla</em>, I targeted the load-bearing columns with Donkey Kong’s ripped arms to quickly bring it down. Reveling in the destruction made me feel equal parts satisfied and sinister, all while Donkey Kong struck a goofy pose.</p><p>Other times, I could sense a direct throughline from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and other major Nintendo franchises. The way that Donkey Kong can roll into a jump (and roll at the top of a jump) feels like maneuvering with <em>Odyssey</em>’s Cappy, while exploring the heights and depths of sublevels and experimenting with physics is reminiscent of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. But through it all, the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> game coming out on July 17th feels, above all else, like it’s breaking new ground as its own thing.</p><p><em>Bananza </em>is an open-world platforming RPG, complete with a skill tree that you can chip away at as you collect banandium gems. Finding five of them grants you one skill point. The skills range from upgrading basic moves, such as expanding the radius of the “clap” action, which automatically picks up nearby collectibles while revealing some hidden ones, to unlocking entirely new abilities. </p><p>Upgrading will happen quickly if you’re the exploring type, as there are dozens of hidden rewards in every area. New routes — not just secrets — will be exposed as you punch through materials. I get the impression that no two people will explore or fight their way through this game the exact same way.</p><p>As Donkey Kong, you can punch forward, upward, and downward, each with a different face button. You’ll rip out a chunk of the ground beneath by pressing ZR. Pressing and holding the button again will let you aim your throw, either with the right stick or with motion controls. </p><p>If you don’t feel like strategizing how you’ll destroy enemies, filling up your Bananergy meter by collecting gold will let you go into Bananza mode, which is apeshit. Donkey Kong can transform into different creatures, each with their own abilities. You can toggle between forms on the fly, allowing for some truly bewildering destruction and tactics.</p><p>Part of my demo’s focus was to explore the variety of locations in <em>Bananza</em>. Your main objective is to reach the core of the planet, and so you progress by digging deeper. I started at level one, and after being jumped around to a different part of the game, I was at level 300. Many of the sublevels that I visited were large, self-contained worlds full of collectibles and challenge areas. The fact that there are hundreds of them waiting to be explored has me excited to fully dig into the adventure.</p><p>Another focus was on Pauline, Donkey Kong’s kid sidekick, who Nintendo says is a major character in the new game. She has personal stakes in helping Donkey Kong reach the planet’s core because it’ll supposedly grant her the wish to go back home. In addition to fleshing out her backstory (she’ll have to meet Mario at <em>some </em>point in the future, since she eventually grows up and becomes mayor of New Donk City, right?), Pauline is a playable character if you enable co-op mode in the game, which can be done via the pause menu. </p><p>Player two isn’t a bystander. They have crosshairs and can shoot at terrain and enemies to aid player one. I tested this mode with a Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, moving it around to aim and firing with the ZR trigger. It felt pretty natural. As you move the cursor, it shows the type of material you’re hovering over (concrete, sand, gold, etc.), and you can set it as your ammo type by holding ZR. Alternatively, you can control Pauline’s crosshairs with a controller.</p><p>Pauline’s projectiles take the form of comic-style onomatopoeia (e.g., “HA!” or “WOW!“). There’s no explanation for this other than it’s just funny. But from a gameplay perspective, the action allows player two to play a major role in progression. For example, she can shoot gold at enemies and obstacles to create more damage on impact than with stone. It’s a smart evolution of player two’s more passive involvement in <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p><p>I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t notice some technical shortcomings with this prelaunch version of the game. During some hectic transitions, the frame rate took a noticeable dip, but gameplay was smooth for the most part, which is an achievement for a game that’s bursting with physics and particle effects. Also, when I was covering a lot of distance while flying in Bananza mode, there was a lot of texture pop-in. The game’s fast loading speeds, detailed character models, and vibrant worlds make it clear why this had to be a Switch 2 game, but the visual issues are a little disappointing to see on the new, more powerful hardware, especially for such a high-profile release.</p><p>Mario fans might bemoan the lack of a new 3D platformer, but I get the impression that <em>Bananza </em>— made by the <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>developers — is a huge game that should keep players satisfied for a while. It’s tough to shake the feeling of its joyous, yet slightly overwhelming depth, when loading a level. I’m a person who wants to see what’s hiding under every stone, and now there’s finally a game that will let me do just that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim has detailed more on the studio's next game, Dead Take, and its exploration of Hollywood, which stars Neil Newbon and Ben Starr as its two leads.</p>
<p>Newbon is perhaps best known as Astarion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, among other roles, while Ben Starr starred as Clive in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and, most recently, as Verso in the well-received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Salim, himself an actor known for playing Bayek in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, described Dead Take to Eurogamer as "a reverse escape room" set in a Hollywood mansion. It's a psychological horror game that blurs the boundaries between film and game as it explores the theme of success.</p>

<p>"How far will you go for success?" asked Salim. "What are you willing to give for that? Can you separate the art from the artist?"</p>
<p>The fresh teaser trailer, above, hints at what we can expect from both gameplay and the actors' performances.</p>
<p>Salim explained players will be exploring the mansion to solve puzzles by finding live-action clips containing solutions that can be spliced together. It all sounds very Alan Wake meets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a> to me, with Salim admitting both were influences.</p>
<p>Indeed, the use of live-action footage will reflect the game's themes and the focus on the acting profession. "You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you <em>them</em>. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>As such, the game's blurring of boundaries is a reflection of Salim's own career, balancing game development with working as an actor himself, most recently in Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon.</p>
<p>The studio's previous game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a> was a personal project for Salim, influenced by his own experience of grief after the passing of his father. Dead Take, initially at least, is a highly contrasting follow-up, but it's no less personal.</p>
<p>"Within Hollywood and acting, I've experienced and seen and heard a lot of stories of people who would do and give anything for stardom and are quite openly very comfortable with that," he said. "It's quite frightening."</p>
<p>Salim explained how the game will explore abuse of power and the toxicity of fame, which he, Starr, and Newbon have all witnessed in their careers. "I grew up with these guys," said Salim, who's worked together with both actors in the past. "Now we're in the games industry together, and yet the stories are always the same. That is essentially what I really wanted to depict and play with here, pulling from very raw and honest, truthful spaces."</p>
<p>He added: "The reason why it's with friends is because it deals with such raw and honest topics that are based on reality, and the only people you can really do that with, or explore that with, are people that you trust and rely on and are incredibly professional. It's very revealing."</p>

<figcaption>The change in tone from Tales of Kenzera is plain to see | <span>Image credit: <cite>Surgent Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Still, the horror tone of Dead Take is in stark contrast to Tales of Kenzera. "People have an idea in regards to 'oh, this is the kind of game that you'll always make as a studio'," said Salim. "With Dead Take, this is us saying 'we're storytellers first and foremost' and that's really what's key for this.</p>
<p>"People would have obviously expected a similar element or ilk of Zau with it, but actually what we want to show is that we are diverse in regards to the stories that we can tell and the genres and the spaces and the places we can play in."</p>
<p>He continued: "It's coming from a place of what's the story we want to tell, what's the best medium for it, and what's also the best genre or take on it? And what better way of exploring how far you will go than putting you in a first-person psychological horror game where you're playing an actor who literally is always living on the edge of 'I don't know when my next paycheck is coming through'? How do I secure a legacy? How do I secure that my sense of self is important and valid? That is the journey of an actor, constantly."</p>
<p>Essentially, Dead Take will peel back the layers on Salim's own work as an actor. "The more you succeed, or the deeper down you go, the darker it gets, the weirder it gets, the more behind the curtains you see," he said of the game. "It's very different playing a day part of a film than playing the lead role in something. The lead role, you're so much more involved, you see more of how the cogs are working. That's the journey I want to take you on here."</p>
<p>The personal experience of Salim, Newbon, and Starr will only add to the game's authenticity, again paralleling Tales of Kenzera and its Afrofuturist aesthetic inspired by the Bantu Tales. "In truth," said Salim,"for us the only thing we can do is speak from that authenticity. And this game made sense for that."</p>
<p>Dead Take will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">published by Palworld maker Pocketpair</a>. "It's really lovely when you meet someone who's aligned in regards to the vision of where they want to see the industry go," said Salim of the collaboration. "It's like fireworks, it just made sense."</p>
<p>Dead Take doesn't yet have a release date, but will launch later this year on PC (Steam). The studio also has another game in development, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG currently known as Project Uso</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries]]></content:encoded>

		<p>One of the surprises just revealed about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is that the game comes from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-confirmed-as-super-mario-odyssey-team/">the team behind Super Mario Odyssey at Nintendo EPD Tokyo</a> – the director and designers have not been confirmed by Nintendo, but that this project is from the same studio will absolutely raise expectations – and having spent a few hours playing the game, I can see some of that freewheeling design ethos shining through. Yes, this is a game where you can mindlessly smash stuff, but there’s also a lot of clever design around this core gameplay hook to provide more structure, bring delight through different gameplay ideas and abilities, and fill the world with challenges and diversions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza –&nbsp;Smashing platforming that makes the Switch 2 sing" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YI0hPqY5O-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the core of any 3D platformer is how you get around, and Donkey Kong Bananza is a delight in that regard. In contrast to the carefully measured jumping distances and heights of a Mario game, DK can barrel his way through the worlds. There’s a real heft and weight to his running, jumping and forward tumbling, but he can also grab onto and clamber up most vertical surfaces in a way that is so immediate and empowering. There’s obviously a route planned for you to follow, some prescribed paths and goals to reach, but you’re also deeply rewarded for using DK’s movement abilities to get off the beaten path.</p>


<p>You can also just reshape the world. There’s three buttons dedicated to punching – one each for forward, upward and downward punching – and DK’s strength is such that he can just obliterate chunks of the world, carving out tunnels through the rock with his bare fists. Depending on the softness of the terrain, that will be quicker or slower, and things like concrete cannot be punched through, but instead need you to find the exploding purple rock known as Boom Bombs to chuck at it. This also feeds into the combat, with many enemies having skeletal bodies that have been encased in rock for you to smash through first.</p>


<p>What digging really allows for, though, is uncovering secrets hidden below the surface. It feels like there’s a never-ending string of surprises and delights to find by smashing holes in the world. There’s a whole bunch of Banandium Gem bananas to find, with every fifth gem that DK gobbles up netting you a skill point to unlock and augment his abilities – things like jumping off a held rock to hop further, a spinning attack, or extended range for his sonar-like ground slaps. There’s also chests that can be spawned in as dynamic rewards, giving a nice bundle of gold or maps to some of the collectables hidden elsewhere – like fossils which are needed for buying new costumes and hair colours. And heck, there can also just be entire caverns or rooms hidden away for you to find when you smash through their walls!</p>
<p>As was revealed during last week’s Nintendo Direct, the purple crystalline buddy that was featured in DK Bananza’s initial reveal is actually Pauline. This is a younger version of the character that is yet to become mayor of New Donk City, where her one true aspiration is to become a famous singer – and a powerful singer, at that. The pair of them have to adventure deep to the centre of this world where legend has it that they’ll be rewarded with their dreams coming true. Each world you play through might as well be being bathed in daylight, even if its supposedly miles underground. It’s a very Disney Channel, kid-friendly rendition of Pauline’s character that I instinctively fear will start to grate through the story, but it’s also a good way of giving DK a new adventuring companion and bridging some of the divide between Donkey Kong Country and the Mario series.</p>
<p>Pauline’s singing, though, is the key to continuing their adventure. Certain parts of the world have been blocked off by a shimmery purple goop, which can only be removed by reaching the point from which it’s spread and having Pauline sing to break through the tape blocking it, unleashing DK’s movement abilities on these areas once more.</p>

<p>And then there’s the various Bananza transformations that her voice can trigger. Kong Bananza transforms DK into a bare-buttocked giant of himself, able to smash even through concrete with a little bit of wind up, greatly helping with certain fights and challenges. It’s pretty much what you’d expect, the only limit being how long the transformation lasts before you need to collect gold and recharge. The second transformation is Ostrich Bananza, lending DK the ability to flap and then glide through the air, even dropping explosive eggs from up high – they’re trickier to aim than you might like, and there’s more to come beyond that.</p>
<p>We got to play with DK’s Ostrich form in a level deeper into the game where there’s vine-link tree trunks to clamber around on, lower platforms sit amidst poisonous water, and ostrich peoples to meet. It was really just a glimpse of what’s to come, and this area where we could experience Ostrich Bananza wasn’t really the best use of this form, just scratching the surface of what it could offer in terms of gameplay. These Bananza transformations are what I’m most curious to see explored through the full game.</p>
<p>You’ll also get to use these transformations on plenty of occasions through the challenge stages that you can find dotted around the world. Teleporting you to different arenas, they can be straight up timer battles, side-scrolling stages, or something a bit more puzzling – like having Kong Bananza and needing to completely demolish a house in the most effective way possible. It’s like the Shrines from Breath of the Wild…. but you’re DK instead.</p>

<p>Having Pauline along for the adventure opens up the option of co-op gameplay for Donkey Kong Bananza, in a fashion very much in keeping with Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey. It’s the same style of lopsided co-op where one person plays as the main character and the other can add a bit of chaotic help to the action, though there’s some really neat tricks that feed off the world deformation and materials as well. Simply put, Pauline can sing and shout ranged attacks, which are targeted by player 2, making great use of motion control pointing or the mouse mode –&nbsp;it was this latter option that we tried, and it naturally works great for aiming.</p>
<p>What’s very cool is that Pauline’s shouts can absorb materials from the world and then send word-shaped blocks flying – it defaults back to stone if nothing has been absorbed. This even includes the Boom Bombs rock, which is great for battles where you need to smash through rocky outer shells, but it also allows you to pick up softer earth and create in-game sculptures in a much simpler fashion than just playing as DK. The only limit is that Pauline only has so many charges of a material before needing to recharge.</p>

<p>While this kind of co-op is far from essential, it’s still great to have for family gaming. That there’s also support for GameShare support for both Switch 2 and Switch 1 locally, and via GameChat is also fantastic.</p>
<p>I was a little unsure of Donkey Kong Bananza from my first hands on at the Switch 2 reveal event, but while some elements like just how chaotic and frenzied the screen can get while digging with complete abandon still feel a little unlike Nintendo, playing for longer reveals a lot more of what this team are trying to do and how the inventiveness that’s been a core part of this studio’s games for so long can really shine through.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/backbone-pro-review-controller-that-wants-to-be-controller-you-take-to-every</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backbone-pro-review-a-controller-that-wants-to-be-the-controller-you-take-to-every-device.1232694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's impossible to ignore mobile gaming, and in a household where the TV is shared, having a Switch or a game on my phone to play has always been important. Over the past month, I've been rigorously putting the Backbone Pro to the test to see if it's not just a daily driver for a mobile controller, but also worth being a controller for my PC, TV, or tablet.</p>

<p>To give a rough overview of the form factor and layout, the Backbone Pro features Xbox face buttons, two asymmetrical control sticks, and all of the other buttons you'd expect, including a screenshot button and a Backbone button used to sometimes bring you back to the home app.</p>

<h2>Not Just For Mobile Phones</h2>

<p>There's also the titular 'backbone,' the rigid flat bar connecting the left half of the controller with the right, and a USB-C port on the right interior. One of the major benefits of the Backbone Pro though, is that it isn't just intended to be a controller for your phone, but with some nice Quality of Life options in the app easily pairs with your computer, TV, or any other Bluetooth-enabled device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-expanded.jpg?itok=Sju3QfYY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-expanded.jpg?itok=vlqnTzTs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What the Backbone Pro looks like expanded, with the help of my phone case</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect of the Backbone, its primary purpose is--or maybe more correctly now, was--to serve as a premium controller to plug into your phone. Whether you're playing games locally on your phone like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f8851e33-5ece-492a-ad7d-497b40971808" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro </em></a>or<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ff64fef-2548-48f1-b672-70a927042f07" href="https://techraptor.net/games/infinity-nikki" rel="nofollow">Infinity Nikki</a></em>, or streaming the latest games through Xbox Gamepass or Nvidia GeForce Now, this controller is meant to give you a Nintendo Switch-like gaming experience.</p>

<p>One unfortunate part of the Backbone Pro is that there isn't any kind of "expand and lock" feature. Every time I wanted to get my phone into the device, I have to do a clumsy kind of expanding motion with one hand holding it open, while fumbling with the other hand to align the phone with the USB-C port.</p>

<p>Once it's in, it's extremely snug, but it's a bit of a fight against the controller until then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-xbox-controller-comparison.jpg?itok=WFswRusK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-xbox-controller-comparison.jpg?itok=WKBm9FWt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>About the same width, but very different shape</figcaption></figure><p>While it is a mobile controller, it's certainly not a cramped controller (which is excellent for someone with larger hands like me). When not connected to a phone it cinches up to be approximately the same width as a standard Xbox Series X|S controller, the major difference being that the buttons for the Xbox controller are closer together, with the grips making an upside-down V shape, whereas the Backbone controls are more parallel to one another.</p>

<p>Another nice touch, especially as mobile phones are losing their headphone port, is that at the base of the left grip there is a headphone port.</p>

<h2>Expanded or Unexpanded?</h2>

<p>The parallel controls led to an interesting situation for me. While playing with a phone plugged in the spread of the controller made the straight-on halves of the Backbone Pro extremely comfortable to play with. It was easy to nestle the full controller into the palm of my hand. Conversely, the times that I played using the controller as a standalone Bluetooth device, connected to my PC or TV, in its unexpanded form, led to having to have my wrists at an odd angle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-nicer-close-up.jpg?itok=ciyDzedT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-nicer-close-up.jpg?itok=rkq5Ammw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>USB-C passthrough, along with a sync button and headphone jack can be seen under the controller</figcaption></figure><p>I'd compare this experience to someone using Joy-Cons mounted in the Joy-Con grip. It will certainly work, but it doesn't feel quite as nice as a traditional controller.</p>

<p>The face buttons have more space to breathe from one another, but not so much that you can't get at all of them with a well-placed rolling thumb. While all the buttons have a more squishy feel as opposed to a click, the D-pad suffers from this squishiness the most. If you like that fast feedback on your D-pad for fighting games or retro platformers then unfortunately this controller won't be for you.</p>

<h2>The Backbone Software</h2>

<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the Backbone Pro was the software in the Backbone app to back it up. Once connected to your phone you can launch the Backbone app. This serves as a hub not only recognizing what games you have on your phone, but also what streaming service libraries have to offer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-splash-screen.jpg?itok=GK7kxYND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-splash-screen.jpg?itok=3BeiS-Em 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Loading up the Home Screen you can view games and apps that you've recently opened. It was pretty impressive to see on initial boot <em>Balatro</em>, which I had most recently played, as well as links to the Xbox app and Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there were a number of 'Touch-Only' games that did appear in my library, like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97fd06ae-7da1-41c2-ae4a-97eca3bf5b59" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-play-pokemon-tcg-like-pro" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a> and the <em>New York Times Games</em> app, but other games like <em>Set </em>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31c4e687-3a88-4358-8d59-776dca35c4b9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-go" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Go</em></a> that didn't appear at all.</p>

<p>For these games that don't officially support controllers, Backbone has a feature called TouchSync. This lets you map button presses to portions of the screen. For a game with a mobile-only interface you can make it so that pressing the A button will touch the button on the screen creating a bridge between a mobile game that's touch only, and a mobile game that supports controllers.</p>

<p>I expect that for games like <em>Pokemon Go</em>, that don't show up in the app at all, there's a fear that TouchSync could be detected as a cheating tool so the Backbone app errs on the side of caution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-pairing-screen.jpg?itok=u-BIKn0g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-pairing-screen.jpg?itok=K89UeoNI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Monitor phone and controller stats, while quickly pivoting between devices​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>The other fantastic feature of the Backbone Pro controller, when connected to your phone, is that you can swap what device it is paired with by bringing up the controller's settings. Even to this day I've got a separate Xbox controller for my Xbox, one for my Steam Link, and one for the PC just so that I don't need to spend the few second unpairing and repairing.</p>

<p>With this app functionality, you can toggle between any of these devices with the tap of a button. I was genuinely impressed with just how easy this was. The only downside of this is that you need to have your phone physically connected to the device to access these options.</p>

<p>This also made it incredibly easy to be playing through a game like <em>South of Midnight</em> on my phone while on the couch, and then when the TV became free I could swap inputs from my phone to my TV and pick up immediately where I left off. The combination of Backbone Pro and Xbox Gamepass honestly felt like the future of gaming that services like Google Stadia were trying to achieve, maybe ahead of their time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-back-buttons.jpg?itok=hdomUNAO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-back-buttons.jpg?itok=XzxP9yWp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Back buttons future proof the Backbone Pro</figcaption></figure><h2>Backbone Pro Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's clear that the Backbone's strength, and main focus is still in being a mobile first controller. With the Backbone app you can easily turn your touchscreen phone into a controller-first experience, including the ability to 'convert' some games from touch to controller interface.</p>

<p>That being said, as more and more devices become controller compatible, especially with the advent of Xbox's "This is an Xbox" campaign Backbone seems incredibly ahead of the curve creating a controller that not only syncs up with all Bluetooth devices, but also allows for easy swapping between them all.</p>

<p>If you've been waiting for a controller for your phone, this is going to be the one you want to buy. There's enough smart engineering in here and forethought for the landscape that mobile and cloud gaming is heading in that it's going to be a pricier purchase now that will pay off time and time again.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-dead-take-will-star-baldurs-gate-3-and-clair-obscur-icons.1232691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has revealed the two main stars of its upcoming psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, and they'll be familiar to you if you're a big RPG fan.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the first big name joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>is Ben Starr. If you don't know the name, perhaps you'll know him from what are likely his most iconic roles, namely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a>'s Clive Rosfield and&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s Verso.</p>

<p>Joining Starr as&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s co-lead is Neil Newbon, whose voice you'll likely recognize as that of perennially horny party member&nbsp;Astarion in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>. He's also played roles in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/detroit-become-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Detroit: Become Human</em></a>, to name but a few items on his resume.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr-door.jpg?itok=aZJtTeiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr-door.jpg?itok=8yo53AVW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spooky psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>will have two very recognizable leads.</figcaption></figure><p>Starr will play Vinny Monroe, while Newbon will take the role of Chase Lowry. In a new teaser trailer, both Monroe and Lowry's names are linked to another character called "Willie"; I presume they're both actors playing this role, and in true horror fashion, it's all going to get a little bit&nbsp;<em>Black Swan</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-pocketpair-dead-take" rel="nofollow">first announced earlier this month</a>, and it's the next major project from&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios. It'll also serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs" rel="nofollow">first big publishing effort</a> for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a "luxurious yet secluded Hollywood Hills mansion", according to a press release, and will see players taking the role of an actor searching for their missing friend.</p>

<p>You shouldn't expect too much high-octane combat from this one; instead, you'll be solving "escape room-style puzzles" and splicing together live-action videos&nbsp;<em>Immortality</em>-style, hence the presence of Starr and Newbon.</p>




<p><em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but it's slated to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Bit of an odd one in businessworld. Ubisoft have handed the job of selling their upcoming fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era">Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era</a> to another publisher. Hooded Horse are taking on that task, a crowd you might know as the purveyor of other strategical capers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a> and the like. Experienced tactics barons and ostensibly the right bunch for the job. The question that's bugging me is: why? The answer is probably: money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are thrilled to welcome Hooded Horse aboard to support the next chapter of Heroes of Might and Magic," said Alain Corre, Ubi's chief publishing officer. "Their passion for the franchise and strong connection with strategy communities make them the perfect complement to Unfrozen’s creative talent."</p>
<p>Unfrozen are the studio who're actually making the game, and who likewise say they are "very excited" to be casting their spells under the watchful gaze of Tim Bender, the CEO of Hooded Horse, whose steadily growing payload of strategy games grows ever more threatening to the western world. </p>
<p>"This is a unique relationship," said a representative from Hooded Horse, who clarified that the strategy specialists will be taking over the "day-to-day operations of publishing" the game, and will be listed alongside Ubi on the Steam page.</p>
<p>"Hooded Horse will serve as publisher like it does for all of its other titles, but Ubisoft remains in the picture as well, supporting where needed, and it also remains the owner of the Heroes IP."</p>
<p>It's hard to know the exact reasons for offloading such a game to another publisher, but it's possibly a result of Ubisoft's ongoing internal fidgeting - a decision that benefits some spreadsheet somewhere in the blue-lit bowels of the accounting department. Press releases like the one quoted above don't normally enlighten anyone as to the real logic behind the slow and inscrutable movements of large companies. 

</p><p>For their part, Unfrozen say publishing with Hooded Horse "means more marketing support, better visibility, and helps extend our reach to more regions." But it's hard to understand why a giant like Ubisoft couldn't provide such things themselves. We've asked them for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft split into two separate entities</a>, like some freaky dungeon slime. One big Tencent-flavoured subsidiary carved off Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six , and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, while other games (your Princes of Persia, your Raymans) remained more firmly on the French behemoth's plate. Since then Ubisoft have warned of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">delays and cost-cutting</a>. This deal with Hooded Horse might simply be one of those cost-cutting measures. </p>
<p>As for the game itself, Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-announce-new-back-to-roots-heroes-of-might-magic-game-with-the-iratus-devs-in-charge">announced last year</a> and its early access release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3105440/view/585018505747763751?snr=1_5_9_">has been delayed until later this year</a>, say the developers. It's a turn-based strategy prequel that wants to go back to the series roots. You'd have to get some mucky hands to find those roots - they're buried back in 1995. I'll probably sit it out, for fear of 30 years of lore. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: I worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a> as a writer, which was eventually published by Hooded Horse.</em></p>

Naturally, seeing these two square off in a wrestling match gets your imagination flowing—what other sports rivals would be great to see in the ring? From the past to the present, there are a ton of hypothetical matchups that would not only be awesome to watch but fun to play for yourself in <em>WWE 2K</em>.</p><p>And then there are the storylines and personas that these athletes could have as professional wrestlers. The subtext to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8glzO2QHRA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8glzO2QHRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brunson and Haliburton facing off in the ring last year</a></span> (and what subsequently happened in the playoffs this year) makes this DLC truly rewarding for basketball fans.</p><p>So imagine taking some of the best trash talkers and personalities from other sports and bringing their rivalries to the ring—the storylines for these fights would be incredible.</p></div></div><div><p> Let’s start off with a no-brainer, as this rivalry already has a bit of pro wrestling to it, courtesy of John Cena’s “you can’t see me” taunt. One of the most contentious feuds in The W right now dates back to Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark’s college days, and there’s always chirping and physicality when these two face off. Stripping away all the culture wars and B.S. that surrounds them, this would be a perfect match to bring into the ring—especially with some potentially wild finishing moves. CC could leap off the top rope, or even a steel cage for extra distance, to mimic her signature logo 3s. And Angel’s physicality is tailor-made for wrestling—think Jade Cargill, who shook up the entire WWE when she debuted. Her finisher would naturally involve tossing someone into the ropes and slamming them on the rebound. </p></div><div><p>More of a figurative rivalry, this one pits the old (read: current, for LeBron fans) face of the league against one of the many young stars trying to take over. We chose Ant because his personality isn’t just great for the NBA, it would make him a must-watch WWE superstar. His walkout would ooze swagger, and his pre-match trash talk would be second to none. Not to mention, he’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN-Qw1vO3e8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN-Qw1vO3e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fierce competitor who thinks he can dominate any sport</a></span>, so he’d eagerly jump into the ring without hesitation.</p><p>LeBron is a certified GOAT, but he’s also one of sports’ greatest “what if he played another sport” athletes. His size and strength, combined with his speed and agility, make him an ideal fit for wrestling. Add in his goofy personality and intense competitiveness, and the lead-up to this match would be an all-time classic.</p></div><div><p>Similar to LeBron and Ant, this is more of a figurative rivalry—one based on position and stature rather than direct animosity. Of course, the media would play up the ex-teammates angle, and honestly, that makes for a perfect WWE backstory. It would go something like this: Judge and Soto were a dominant tag team duo, coming so close winning a belt, only for Soto to turn heel and join their rival tag team. </p><p>These two would also make incredible wrestlers. You’ve got the Yankees captain—a towering figure in his sport—who would dominate the ring, throwing people over the top rope for fun, just like he smashes baseballs with ease. Then there’s the New York turncoat: a young, generational talent who’d be simply good at everything. He’s got strength, agility, bravado, and his signature shuffle would be the perfect in-ring taunt. This would be a marquee matchup for a SummerSlam-type event, with hype levels through the roof.</p></div><div><p> NFL rivalries more often thrive between teams, not players. It’s tough to get two players to constantly match up against one another because of the size of the rosters and the timing of the schedule. However, recently, we’ve gotten to witness a recurring matchup between Pat Mahomes and Josh Allen in the playoffs. Mahomes dominates the matchup in real life, but that’s all the more reason to give Chiefs and Bills fans the chance to fight this one out in the ring. </p><p>The three-time Super Bowl champion would be a pesky wrestler, always escaping defeat—whether it was by some unbelievable “how did he do that??” move or with a little help from the referees. He’d be the champion most wrestling fans love to hate, even though they couldn’t deny his immense talent. His Buffalo Bills rival, on the other hand, would be a really physical wrestler. He’d be extremely tough, often fighting through injuries, and while he wouldn’t have a perfect record in title matches, he’d continuously make his presence felt in the ring, denying anyone who would count him out. </p></div><div><p> One of the greatest rivalries of the modern era, these two soccer GOATs would be an amazing fight in the ring. Ronaldo, a physical specimen, would be ruthless, taunting his opponents long before the match even began, all while showing off his opulent lifestyle, filled with money, women, and crazed fans. Messi is a humble fighter who’d be arguably the hardest to pin down, submit, or even catch with his quickness. Think prime Ric Flair, if he were more chiseled, vs. pre-heel John Cena, if he were more athletic.</p><p>Their storylines leading into the fight would be amazing—a true spectacle, as polar opposites entering the ring. Similar to real life, rabid fans would endlessly play and replay this fight, only adding another championship to their storied careers, stoking the debate further between these two legends. </p></div><div><p> We’ve seen glimpses of this fight already in the NBA, but c’mon, we gotta see the whole thing. These two Western Conference heels would be right at home in a WWE ring, trying to take home the belt for the most annoying superstar. Honestly, I think Green would win this matchup easily. He’d clearly use any and all dirty moves to win. But at that point, it should just turn into a Gauntlet match, with the four-time NBA champion facing all of his victims over the years: Sabonis, Nurkic, Poole—the list goes on. </p><p>And honestly, all of those guys would make for hilarious wrestlers. Just imagine Jordan Poole flying into the ring, trying to pull off a Ricochet-esque move, while Steph Curry’s enforcer just punches him mid-air. That’d be must-watch TV. </p></div><div><p> Another recent rivalry from The W, these two power forwards have been sparring for the past few years with championships on the line. A’ja, the best player in the league, versus Stewie, who’s got an all-time great collection of championship trophies and awards, would be a must-watch title fight—a Bianca Belair vs. Charlotte Flair-level matchup. </p><p>This would honestly be a great WWE rivalry that would span multiple years and title fights. Depending on the year, either one of these champs could come out on top, and their legacies would be forever connected. Bring in Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray for tag-team matches, and we’d truly get some iconic moments. </p></div><div><p>If you want trash talk, drama, and Hall-of-Fame basketball players facing off in the ring, then this rivalry would be a must-watch. KG’s infamous taunting of Carmelo one night in The Garden is a legendary tale in the NBA world, and getting to play this fight out would be pure comedy. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10144935-video-carmelo-anthony-reveals-kevin-garnett-said-wild-s--t-before-2013-fight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10144935-video-carmelo-anthony-reveals-kevin-garnett-said-wild-s--t-before-2013-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We’ve learned that the rumored “Honey Nut Cheerios” taunt wasn’t actually real</a></span>, but in the WWE, it definitely could be. There was also the confrontation at the team bus after the game, which is a classic WWE plot device, with many iconic wrestling moments going down in parking garages.</p><p>But just imagine the actual fight—the Knicks legend already in the ring, staring at the entrance, as The Big Ticket comes out to his hype song, with that huge grin on his face, just stuffing Honey Nut Cheerios in his mouth. The energy in the arena would be electric. And if you pull off the upset while playing as Melo, he’d have to add insult to injury and hit the crowd with KG’s own&nbsp;“Anything is Possibleeee” scream.</p></div><div><p> Another fight that we got a chance to see play out in real life, Joey Bats vs. Odor was an instant classic in the baseball world. But with only one good punch thrown, we clearly need the chance to play out the full fight in the ring. This fight would have a great storyline, too, with Bautista dropping his famous bat-flip celebration on one of Odor’s allies—just for the former second baseman for the Texas Rangers to sucker punch him in the ring and challenge him to a title fight. Embarrassed, Bautista would have to accept, and these two would fight tooth and nail to win. If they each brought a few teammates along, this could make for a thrilling TLC match as well. </p></div><div><p>We all know the classic Bird vs. Magic rivalry, but honestly, there’s an opportunity for <em>WWE 2K</em> fans to run a Triple Threat match and include another all-time great—Dr. J—in the mix. The question is, would any of these superstars form a temporary truce to win? Ask someone from that generation, and it would probably make them short-circuit just to contemplate this matchup. This fight would be amazing not only for the storylines between the three superstars entering the ring but also for the differences in their wrestling styles.</p><p>The Lakers legend would have some of the slickest moves the WWE has ever seen, making every win look effortless. The Celtics great would just outwork his opponents, never submitting and never backing down. And Julius, with his unmatched athleticism, would fly off the ropes every chance he got with an acrobatic finisher.</p></div><div><p>In a Women’s Royal Rumble, we’d need the WNBA’s GOAT to go up against the insane talent she faced over the course of her career. As the first entrant, The White Mamba would have to start against one of her closest friends, but also fiercest rivals, Sue Bird. From there, the other superstars the retired 20-year veteran had to battle over her historic career would slowly stream in: Candace Parker, Maya Moore, A’ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Caitlin Clark, and Skylar Diggins. There would be no shortage of talent in the ring during this Rumble.</p><p>Taurasi would make for an incredible wrestler, too, with her skills on the mic almost matching her greatness in the ring. She’s equal parts funny and acerbic, and you’d never know if she was just toying with you or actually clowning you out of the arena.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wwe-2k-dlc-tyrese-haliburton-jalen-brunson-rivalry-1851785376]]></content:encoded>
