              <p><span>Not all heroes wear capes. Some of them wear show-accurate </span><i><span>Power Rangers </span></i><span>cosplay. That’s what an anonymous hacker going by the pseudonym Martha Root did at a recent hacking conference where they used their hacking skills to delete white supremacist websites live on stage while dressed as the pink ranger.</span></p> <p><span>The Chaos Communication Congress is an annual convention held by the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Germany. Root gave a presentation there alongside journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs which concluded with the hacker deleting the servers of white supremacist sites WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal live on stage.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/hacktivist-deletes-white-supremacist-websites-live-on-stage-during-hacker-conference/"><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span> lays out, these three sites are dedicated to racist match making, racist egg and sperm donations, and a racist labor marketplace. White people use these sites to make sure they only link up with other white people. The administrator of these sites confirmed on </span><a href="https://x.com/whitedatenet/status/2007852479179112852"><span>X</span></a><span> the servers were deleted in an act of “cyberterrorism.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Root also published personal data from these sites, including profile images and other information, but is holding back emails, passwords, and private conversations “for now.” The gender disparity in these sites is pretty telling, with Root noting that 86 percent of users were men, with women making up the additional 14 percent, a split they say “makes the </span><i><span>Smurfs</span></i><span> village look like a feminist utopia.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Imagine calling yourselves the ‘master race’ but forgetting to secure your own website — maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination,” Root said.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‼️A German hacker known as "Martha Root" dressed as a pink Power Ranger and deleted a white supremacist dating website live onstage</p> <p>This happened during the recent CCC conference.</p> <p>Martha had infiltrated the site, ran her own AI chatbot to extract as much information from users… <a href="https://t.co/vpTEoFR8JR">pic.twitter.com/vpTEoFR8JR</a></p> <p>— International Cyber Digest (@IntCyberDigest) <a href="https://twitter.com/IntCyberDigest/status/2007183888377118750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Slay.

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Fit A Whole-Ass Computer Inside A Single Brick To Make Star Wars Sounds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-smart-play-brick-star-wars-march-interactive-sets-2000656727</link>
            <guid>1397770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego announced a big step forward in how kids will play with the company’s popular plastic bricks. Well, it’s actually really small. In fact, Lego’s new Smart Brick is the size of a standard 4×2 Lego brick, but it contains much of the same tech found in modern phones. And Lego is promising some cool features that will be powered by this new, tiny tech.</p> <p>On January 5, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/live-updates-from-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-2000697509">during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement">Lego unveiled Smart Play</a>, a new smart system of Lego pieces that will work with all pre-existing Lego bricks. The main star of Smart Play is the Smart Brick, which basically acts as a tiny PC and the brains of any set using Smart Play. And this new Smart Brick is packed with tech. Lego says it includes light-sensing and sound-sensing sensors and accelerometers, as well as a “miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser” and a custom-built microchip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. The Smart Brick is charged wirelessly and can snap into any set like a regular brick.</p>

  <p>So what can this new Smart Brick do? Well, if you include some of the other Smart Play Lego pieces, like Smart Tiles or Smart Minifigs, into a build, the Smart Brick can react to how kids play. For example, in a video posted by Lego, you can see kids attaching a propeller to a dinosaur, and when the propeller spins, the connected Smart Brick plays helicopter noises.</p>

 <p>In the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Star Wars</a></em> sets launching with Smart Play in March, the Emperor minifig will play the Imperial March when you sit him on this throne. Ships can blast at each other with laser noises, and lightsabers will hum and whirl when figures holding them are moved.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the most impressive part of all of this is that Lego has designed the system not to need a phone or computer. There is seemingly no app needed for any of these new Smart bits, which should make it very easy for a kid and their parents to set this up. In theory, you start building, and the Smart pieces interact as programmed. Sounds cool, and much better than some of Lego’s past attempts to combine tech and bricks, which often felt clunky and cumbersome as they involved phones, updates, cables, and other junk.</p>

 <p>We won’t have to wait too long to see if Lego’s big promises are real, as <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-unveils-the-smart-brick-and-smart-play-system-march-2026/">Smart Play is set to launch in three different Lego <em>Star Wars</em> sets in March</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomwood">Gloomwood</a> opened the year not with a whimper, but with a town - a Hightown! Right on January 1st, a fresh update and new area (The Hightown District) arrived in the early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game. This new district is very vaguely described as the game's "most vertical open area" yet, and it certainly looks as suitably gloomy as the rest of the game.
</p>
<p>
One of the big new additions alongside the area is a new enemy type, the hoggish constable. The launch trailer offers little to go on on how they might behave, though I imagine the pig and police imagery might offer a hint as to the kind of brutality they might enact upon you if you're spotted.

<p>
There are a few new, as a mostly detail-less Steam post explains, toys to pick up in the update too. One of these toys is a revolver, albeit one with a scope attachment that looks like it may be useful for taking out enemies from afar. There's also a firebomb, which I'm going to assume does exactly what it says on the tin.
</p><p>
This update also serves a reminder for me personally that I really should pick up Gloomwood one of these days. As much as I want to ignore it, the passage of time has resulted in this game having already been in early access for more than three years now. Back when it launched, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomwoods-grimy-stealth-playground-deserves-better-than-the-agony-of-early-access">Alice B. had a little go with it</a> and found it to be quite good, but also simply unfinished, lamenting how hard it was to recommend when the world wasn't ready for anyone to put their skills to the test. Perhaps all these years on, it's time to dive in.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up or wishlist Gloomwood on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[That Surprise Splinter Cell-Like From Last Year’s Xbox Showcase Might Be In Trouble]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736</link>
            <guid>1397746</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During last year’s Xbox Games Showcase, Korea-based developer EVR Studio announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mudang-two-hearts"><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i></a><span>, a stealth action-adventure game with a notable resemblance to the </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> series. Now, the </span><a href="https://evrstudio.com/"><span>team’s website appears offline</span></a><span>, and reports hint at possible layoffs in the past few months.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://need4games.ro/en/mudang-two-hearts-might-be-in-trouble-evr-studio-facing-massive-layoffs"><span>reported by </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i></a><span>, EVR allegedly laid off multiple people due to a lack of funding. The claim is based on a </span><a href="https://thevc.kr/evrstudio"><span>Korean tracking site</span></a><span>, which shows the number of employees decreasing from over a hundred to just 22 as of the time of publication.</span></p>

  <p><span>In addition, sources speaking to </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i><span> were reportedly negative about the studio’s situation, with one of the investors of EVR Studio reportedly saying that </span><i><span>Mudang</span></i><span> is meant to be released by the end of March 2026, which is also the end of the current fiscal year. “If we don’t receive it, the investors will be very upset with the situation, then it will be their meeting,” reads the report.</span></p>

 <p><span>The outlet also reported a sudden silence in terms of online presence. EVR’s official website currently leads to an error message when accessed, and on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251023031820/https://evrstudio.com/"><span>The Wayback Machine</span></a><span>, the latest backups of the site are dated October 23. Over at the studio’s YouTube channel, the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyYAYNA3FD4"><span>last developer diary</span></a><span>—which presented a motion-matching showcase—was uploaded back on August 15, and there have been no more updates since.</span></p>

 <p><span>On LinkedIn, there are </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/evr-studio/people/"><span>at least 34 people</span></a><span> associated with the EVR Studio company profile, although several of those profiles are private. All the public profiles, including those of CEO Yongki Yoon, co-founder, director, and executive producer Dong joon Min, art director Bryan ku, and UI designer Jihong Lee, showcase “present” in the respective Experience tabs of their profile, indicating they are still employed at the company.</span></p>

 <p><span>EVR also has a </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/mudang"><span>Discord server</span></a><span>, which shows over 2,300 members at the time of publication. As of now, the general chat channel is filled with people speculating about the state of the game based on the aforementioned reports, seemingly without an official response from the developer. The latest update, shared via a behind-the-scenes channel, was issued back on August 29.</span></p>

 <p><span>Back then, EVR said all development divisions were focused on validating the playable build to ensure stability, running regression testing and balance tuning. The team also added that the following dev diary update may experience a slight delay because of these tests. “Our team is fully committed to delivering a level of quality that will be recognized by players worldwide, and we look forward to sharing the next stage of progress with you soon,” reads the Discord message.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i><span> is slated to launch in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox consoles. According to EVR, </span><a href="https://x.com/TH_EVRSTUDIO/status/1948740945773822203"><span>the game hit 100,000 wishlists</span></a><span> by July 25 of last year.</span></p> <p><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> has reached out to EVR Studio for comment.</span></p>

			<p>Over the past few days, we have posted excerpts from our extensive interview with <strong>Studio Wildcard</strong> about <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended</strong>'s latest expansion, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a></strong>, and the road all the way toward the long-awaited <strong>ARK 2</strong>. Those articles were focused on tech subjects, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial performance boosts that the developer expects from the upgrade to <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong></a> (planned for March) and the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this upgrade, alongside the potential usage of frame generation technologies, could just be enough to port the game to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> console</a>.</p>



<p>Today, we're publishing the full transcript of the one-hour-long conversation with Co-Founder, Co-Creative Director, Lead Designer, Lead Programmer, and Development Director&nbsp;<strong>Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, edited and condensed for brevity. Even so, it remains a massive beast of a text, which is why we've prepared a table of contents for you to jump into the topic you're most interested in. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="release-challenges"><a href="#release-challenges">The Challenges of Release and Ongoing Development</a></h2>



<p><strong>ARK: Survival Ascended didn't have the best community reception at first. Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-community-is-livid-after-broken-promises-of-ue5-remaster-being-free-for-existing-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the controversy of the game originally being offered for free to Survival Evolved players</a>, user reviews on Steam have only recently shifted into Mostly Positive territory. What have you done in these two years since launch to improve the players' sentiment toward the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> I would say the keyword here is <strong>persistence</strong>. It’s a combination of specific things, but the point is you just stick with it over time. It comes down to the nuts and bolts of people's concerns, which overall boil down to three main tracks; but ultimately, dealing with these concerns takes time, effort, and consistency.</p>



<p>You need a kind of perseverance to deliver on these tracks. These tracks really come down to people's main concerns early on, which were: lack of content, bad performance, and a lack of genuinely new content. Those are the main things. Notwithstanding overall skepticism about the idea of upgrading ARK: Survival Evolved, that would especially be related to, "What's new here that's going to interest me if I've already played the prior game?"</p>



<h2 id="legacy-content"><a href="#legacy-content">Upgrading Legacy Content and Remasters</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> In each of those areas over the last two years, we've made great strides. <strong>Have we done everything we want to do in any of those three areas? No</strong>. We haven't yet upgraded and refreshed all of the legacy content. We still have several more maps to go, expansion packs to go, creatures to do, and so forth. We try to do every one of those with a lot of care and emphasis on improvements, refinement, and putting a new artistic spin on things. I think we've shown that with our last few legacy upgrades. They're not just simple ports. We really go and remaster things, make all-new artwork, refine the level design, and add new areas and creatures. We've been consistently doing that over the last two years. People have seen that most recently this year with upgrading the fan-favorite maps of <strong>Ragnarok</strong> and <strong>Valguero</strong>, while also, over the year before, porting the original <strong>Scorched Earth</strong>, <strong>Aberration</strong>, and <strong>Extinction</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="new-content"><a href="#new-content">New Content: Lost Colony and Bob’s Tall Tales</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Then it also comes down to new content, which has been a variety of things. The most recent example, of course, is a brand-new canonical story expansion path that's at least as large in scope as the largest one we had done previously, <strong>Genesis 2</strong>; but really, in many ways, numerically, it's larger than Genesis 2. More creatures, more new items, a larger map, more story, etc. It's really the biggest expansion map that we've ever done.</p>



<p>That's all-new, with some really cool new gameplay concepts that we can get into. There's genuine excitement around what that means and staking out some new territory for the game. And then finally, on a smaller note outside of the giant expansion pack, there are a lot of smaller types of mini-expansions: new creatures added here and there, but also <strong>Bob’s Tall Tales</strong>, which introduced some fun new vehicles and gameplay upgrades to the title that wouldn't really have been in place or fit within a single giant expansion pack. There were three Bob’s Tall Tales. It was sold as a single upgrade, but it was split into three parts. The first one added trains and wagons, a Western theme. The second one added airships, a little more steampunk-themed; and the third one added physical, drivable, upgradeable, customizable cars. That was really fun to explore some vehicular gameplay with ARK throughout those.</p>



<h2 id="performance-ue57"><a href="#performance-ue57">System Performance and Unreal Engine 5.7 Improvements</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Finally, the raw system performance: <strong>when the game came out, it didn't run very well. It still doesn't run as well as it should, frankly</strong>. But we're up about 50% performance-wise over the initial release of the game on the same hardware. So, it's a really significant improvement, but it's not ultimately yet where we want to be. Where are we going to get more performance from? A big part of it is actually with Epic's latest version of <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong>, which introduces some serious new performance-oriented improvements and systems. Version 5.6 did as well, and we're still on 5.5. So, to get the performance improvements of 5.6 combined with the new features of 5.7 <strong>is going to gain us about another 30 to 40% on both the GPU and the CPU</strong>.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 did a lot of render thread optimizations where they made things work much better in parallel between the render thread, the game thread, the GPU, and the CPU. There are major architectural changes there. And in 5.7, they added an entirely new system for how to draw large foliage, demonstrated <strong>in The Witcher IV demo</strong>, for example. We're actually able to make use of that directly. We have this working internally; we are just still preparing it for release. It's going to take a few months to work all the kinks out of other parts of the engine that have been upgraded, but we can already say that it's about a third performance gain on our existing maps due to the use of this new Nanite tessellation and culling system that Epic has introduced in 5.7 for foliage.</p>



<p>We're really, really excited about that. <strong>It's as close to a magic bullet as you're going to get at this point</strong>. It's one of those rare cases where it's an unalloyed win. There are no real caveats or asterisks. It works way better than what existed before, and we don't have to sacrifice anything—memory or otherwise—to make it work. So, it was as close to a magic solution for some of those performance problems as possible. <strong>We expect the 5.7 upgrade for ARK to roll out by the end of March of 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s so extreme, in fact, that on the side we'd been exploring doing a Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We have that running internally, and <strong>we found that the Switch 2 port was only doable with 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant of a performance improvement. Is that everything we'll ever want to do with performance? No. Server performance needs to continue to get better. But it's one of the major things people are going to see early next year as part of that ongoing process.</p>



<p>It's crazy to think that we launched ARK on 5.2, so we were really suffering from some of the newness of those Nanite systems, foliage systems, and virtual shadow maps. It was all very inefficient. It technically worked, but it was really not performant to the level necessary to render these large, vegetation-heavy scenes in an open-world environment. It got significantly better in 5.5. And the improvements in 5.6 were not directly related to foliage, but were more render thread and parallelism-related—significant changes there to the architecture. Then 5.7 introduced an entirely new system for culling Nanite and rendering large Nanite foliage scenes. It's not automatic. You have to change a few settings to use it on the content side, but they're very easy settings to change. They didn't require re-authoring the content from scratch. We've just been dealing with other things we have to prepare for the engine.</p>



<p>Essentially, there are just other changes Epic made that we're still making sure we don't introduce new bugs with. The other thing that's annoying is every time we do a major engine upgrade, we have to force all of the mods to recook. It's something we can do on the back end. Because of the changes to the material system, we have to trigger a process that takes a couple of weeks to recook the 6,000 or so mods that have been uploaded. We are able to do that automatically because we retain these source files. But it's a bit of a process, and then we have to do a pretty exhaustive testing process after that to make sure that they generally still work. So, it's going to take a few months in 2026 before we're ready to fully roll that out. But yes, we are going to be seeing very real performance gains. Again, the game does run about 40 to 50% better versus its original October launch, but we're going to see another approximate 40% gain in the first half of next year. Epic has done the hard engineering there, but we're able to take advantage of that work and get it out to players.</p>



<p><strong>That's great to hear, honestly. Unreal Engine games are notorious for their stuttering. Do you reckon that these improvements will rid ARK: Survival Ascended, and most UE games as a whole, of most stutters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> It should be better, but I don't know that stuttering will be completely eliminated because of two factors. One, in ARK in particular, some of the stuttering is due to the initiation of actors, which cannot be multi-threaded. When you are playing an online game and you go to a new area and a giant mega-base that somebody has built gets loaded on the client, it really has to be done instantaneously as soon as we get that data. We could possibly try to multi-thread it, but Unreal is pretty bad about network actor instantiation multi-threading. When the client receives an actor like a dino or a building over the network, it pretty much wants to immediately spawn that to start receiving the associated network data. Now, multiply that by 50,000. <strong>When you've got 50,000 structures to spawn and you receive them in a big batch of data all in a single frame, as you can imagine, that's going to result in a hitch</strong>. It has nothing to do with graphics or background loading of the world; it’s literally like, "I just received 50,000 game objects over the network and I need to prepare them for play". That's probably the main stuttering people receive when playing online, especially associated with large bases.</p>



<p>There's another kind of stuttering associated with background loading of the world. A lot of that's been eliminated in more recent versions of Unreal and smoothed out. But there's one particular to Unreal games in general that relates to shader caching. We don't basically do pre-shader caching; I think it has to generate some shader code on the fly from the intermediate shader code, which is HLSL basically, to prepare it for uploading to the GPU. It's specific to your GPU hardware, and that can result in stalls. A lot of Unreal games eliminate that by pre-caching all the shaders they can for your hardware on startup. That's why when many Unreal Engine games start up, you'll go through this shader caching loading screen for like 3 minutes while it builds all the shaders for your GPU.</p>



<p><strong>The issue with ARK is that we've got so much content that I don't think that would be practical in terms of how long it would take</strong>. Second, we also do modding, which makes it even more unpredictable what kind of materials and shaders we're going to need to compile. Modding would make it very ineffective, even if we did it for the base game content. There would still be related stalls because we do allow people to create custom cosmetics, and those get downloaded dynamically by default. So, you essentially can encounter people with arbitrary cosmetics on their character or their bases as you play the game. Those can have completely unique materials and, therefore, unique shaders. </p>



<p>There's no real way to pre-cache those because we don't know what they are in advance. Over time, Epic might be able to thread those things even better. But <strong>I do think hitching in a game that doesn't pre-compile all the shaders is always going to exist to some extent</strong>. I will say that it's gotten a lot better since the earlier versions of Unreal 5. <strong>We expect to do at least one major engine upgrade per year going forward</strong>. We got a good sense of how to do it reasonably efficiently with our upgrade from 5.2 to 5.5 last year in June. We kind of know how to do it relatively smoothly now. So, we will do it again to 5.7 for March, and then wherever Epic is in early to mid-2027 as well.</p>



<h2 id="switch-2"><a href="#switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Development and Performance Goals</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Before I talk about Switch 2, I should note that the 5.7 improvements are not PC specific; most of them apply to both consoles as well. We're looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the Xbox and PlayStation player base who aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is a solid, unbreakable 60 FPS. That gap is largely covered by the 5.6 and 5.7 upgrades.</p>



<p>With Switch 2 in particular, we actually do have a working build of it. Frankly, it was about half off of where it needed to be performance-wise. Memory was actually very good because it has more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S "Lockhart" platform does. Since we already scaled the game for Series S, we were in a better memory state than that console and weren't running out of memory on the Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics than we do on the Series S. The issue was the GPU being weaker. <strong>We wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version</strong>. We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S, and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that. It needed to look approximately like the Series X or PlayStation 5 version, even if at a lower resolution.</p>



<p>To get technical, we would have to do Lumen, Nanite, and Virtual Shadow Maps. All three of those are important to us on Switch 2. We may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is an older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference at a lower resolution like the Switch 2's 1080p handheld or 1440p docked. Nanite, in particular with the large open-world foliage scenes, was hammering the Switch 2 very badly. <strong>Let's be clear, it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience; that's just not in the cards. But it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half of where we needed to be to get to that.</p>



<p>We found that version 5.7—specifically 5.6 and 5.7 combined—gains about 33 to 40% overall frame rate. It was completely GPU-bound. That was very good, but still not where we need to be to get to a solid 30 FPS perceived frame rate. So even the 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. Just to be clear again: memory is totally fine, core graphics functionality is totally fine. It's really the same-looking game on the Switch 2, which itself was impressive, but the frame rate isn't good enough. Version 5.7 got us a lot closer, but it's still not there yet.</p>



<p>There's one last thing we're exploring right now, other than trying to fundamentally change engine internals. Right now, to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on 5.7. How do we get to a 30+ FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with frame generation</strong>, but I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. <strong>It's not yet supported by either NVIDIA</strong>, which makes the Switch 2 GPU, or AMD. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. <strong>We would have to port it ourselves or work with them to do so</strong>. We've just been starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA frame generation is possible on the Switch 2—DLSS obviously is, but that's not the same thing—or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable.</p>



<p>I have to presume one of those will be doable. Technology like AMD's frame interpolation is not hardware-specific; it works on AMD, NVIDIA, and even very old hardware like the GeForce 1080 series from nearly 10 years ago. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be. Let me be frank, I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation. But if I can get to 20 or 25 without it, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough and won't look too smeary or laggy. We're getting there. It's looking good and progressing, and so I hope it's going to release this year.</p>



<p><strong>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, would it support cross-play?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Yes, it would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version. The original Switch version of ARK: Survival Evolved was, unfortunately, a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain and led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been. We wouldn't be making that mistake again. </p>



<p><strong>You can confirm that you would be using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution at the very least, though, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Yes. DLSS works fine and is quite impressive for image sharpening and clarity, but NVIDIA separates the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the frame generation algorithm. They don't currently support frame generation on the Switch 2, though they've been a little vague about it. We have to poke them a little harder and try to get an answer in the new year.</p>



<h2 id="storytelling"><a href="#storytelling">New Storytelling Techniques and the Hollywood Cast</a></h2>



<p><strong>What can you tell us about Lost Colony's development phase? How long did it take you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Regarding the new expansion, it was a pretty fast development. We conceived of it around the second half of last year. We knew we wanted to do a new story expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended to really wrap up a lot of narrative loose ends and connect it to where we want to go with the franchise leading into ARK 2. We wanted to link Extinction, which was the original game's expansion conclusion, to Genesis, which was more sci-fi and space-oriented, and then to the primitive world of ARK 2. We also wanted to make an ice-themed expansion. We were like, "We don't have a good polar environment." We had a little cold area on The Island, and some other maps have little cold areas, but they're not fully fleshed out. Genesis 1 has a cold biome, but it's very tiny.</p>



<p>We thought, "What if we made an expansion all centered around an Arctic or Antarctic setting that explores snowy and icy themes, and feels a little more forlorn and foreboding?". In the lore, there is this facility called <strong>Arat Prime</strong>, which is canonically in the Antarctic. Let's flesh that setting out, as it’s been very mysteriously referred to in the franchise prior to now. By the end of last year, we really hammered out exactly what the story and the overall aesthetic was going to be. We really wanted to have more storyline and be a little more narratively focused than some of our prior expansions, with the maybe exception of Genesis 2.</p>



<p>We thought about how to convey all that story, as we aren't experts at that yet. We happened upon a few different techniques for Lost Colony. There are about 30 minutes of CGI cutscenes and about 10 minutes of anime. We use the anime for certain action-oriented sequences, and we use the CGI for emotional sequences where we have to have a lot of acting, like "face acting". We're not <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> or anything like that yet. We basically said, "All right, we're just going to have an anime studio really crank up the action since we don't think we're capable of mo-capping something like that presently". We use <strong>Unreal MetaHuman</strong> for the CGI characters, and it really is very effective at performance capture and face capture. We also have some illustrated storybook sequences where characters talk to each other. About another 30 minutes of those that are fully voiced and illustrated.</p>



<p>There are also a lot of voice dossiers and diary entries, and characters talking to you in your head throughout the expansion. You're following a quest to confront the Lost King who rules over this Prime domain. He's kind of a fascist dictator, and he's loosely vampiric in a sci-fi context, using the powers of Red Element found under the ice. You yourself are half-turned into a "Red Element Thrall" at the beginning, and you therefore have access to certain abilities which you can develop through a skill tree. There are 70+ skills you can get, covering passive and active buffs, combat, dino-related stuff, and utility. To unlock them, you accomplish various milestones. It's not just like, "Hit a tree for 10 hours." You actually get to do more interesting things to progress.</p>



<p>At the end of last year, we asked <strong>Studio Mappa</strong> in Japan—who did <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>—and they agreed to do the 10 minutes of anime for this expansion pack. We did a little teaser of that at the tail end of the Extinction release. Then we released more teasers early in 2025 and finally got it all done for the release last week. I don't know that we'll always make use of all those methods; it really comes down to how players perceive them. I do foresee us doing significantly more with Unreal MetaHuman going forward. We found that pipeline to be very easy to use and very evocative when properly lit and rendered. Credit to Epic for making that accessible to smaller developers.</p>



<p><strong>Let's talk a bit about the cast of big-time actors and actresses who are returning in Lost Colony from the ARK animated series.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> It has a great cast. <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong> plays Mei Yin. Reprised from the animated series, <strong>Maddie Madden</strong> plays Helena Walker. Helena is the co-protagonist, alongside the real protagonist, the unnamed player survivor. We brought <strong>David Tennant</strong> back playing Rockwell, a series fan-favorite villain. We cast some actors new to the franchise: <strong>Keith David</strong> playing the Lost King; <strong>Auli'i Cravalho</strong>, the voice of Moana, playing Mika, our ARK 2 connection protagonist; and <strong>Katee Sackhoff</strong> as Diana Alarus, a fan-favorite character from the lore. And finally, <strong>Karl Urban</strong> making a cameo as Bob—the original ARK survivor. Karl also let us use his likeness, so Bob now looks like Karl. He shows up at the very end—spoiler alert—of Lost Colony. There'll be a lot more with that going forward as well.</p>



<h2 id="ark-timeline"><a href="#ark-timeline">The 1,000-Year Timeline: Connecting ARK to ARK 2</a></h2>



<p><strong>Some players have been a bit confused about the setting. When does Lost Colony take place in your timeline?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Part of the story is before and part is after, but the part that the player is actually playing is after Genesis. In fact, it's a thousand years after Genesis. Genesis happens very similarly in time to Extinction. We provide "AR" and "BR" timestamps on the screen in some cinematics. BR means <strong>Before Receding,</strong> and AR means <strong>After Receding</strong>. Helena's original timeframe is about 1,000 BR. Then, a thousand years after Helena's human time, the player is doing Scorched Earth, Aberration, and Extinction on the Arks. Saving the world by completing the Reseed Protocol is basically 0 AR. Rockwell ends up on the Genesis seed ships months after the Reseed Protocol happened on Earth.</p>



<p>A thousand years after that is when the player's timeframe in Lost Colony is happening. We refer to that as 1037 AR. That's happening at the same time as things are happening in the ARK 2 story. Those sequences on the world of ARK 2 with the Mika character are concurrent with the player's actions in Lost Colony. So, there are really three timeframes: 1,000 BR (Helena's time), 0 AR (the original ARK trilogy and Genesis), and 1,000 AR (the timeframe for both Lost Colony and ARK 2). We've separated those by a thousand years because we want a lot of things to have happened between the <strong>Reseed Protocol</strong> and the world of ARK 2. A lot of that will be built out so enough time has passed that people don't really remember what happened. It has receded into myth and legend, kind of like <strong>Planet of the Apes</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="future-roadmap"><a href="#future-roadmap">Future Roadmap: Dragontopia, Atlantis, and Galaxy Wars</a></h2>



<p><strong>Diving into the post-Lost Colony roadmap you've recently outlined, the community has been particularly intrigued by Dragontopia. Is it a special collaboration with How to Train Your Dragon or just a homage?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> *laughs* Yes, Dragontopia is just inspired by the <strong>How to Train Your Dragon</strong> franchise. We want to explore what it means to befriend dragons in a slightly different way than regular creature taming. We want to understand a dragon as an independently minded, willful creature that behaves more like a partner and less like a robot. When you tame a dinosaur in ARK, it's pretty docile and predictable. With dragons, we want to develop a new mechanic for bonding with a unique class of creature, including a befriending and character development system. It is not a direct collaboration, at least not yet, and it's not canonical.</p>



<p>We want to take a year off from the hardcore canonical story build-out. <strong>Legacy of Santiago</strong> is in development—a prequel to ARK 2 set on the planet of Arat using ARK 2 mechanics—but we need a two-year process to build that out. We need to treat our story content as an "off-year" process, as opposed to every year trying to release something in the same scope as Lost Colony. Bob’s Tall Tales will have teaser-type narrative breadcrumbs, but not a full build-out.</p>



<p><strong>ARK Atlantis</strong> is also non-canonical. Dragontopia is like "<strong>Disneyland</strong> biomes meets <strong>Pandora</strong> meets <strong>Skyworld</strong>." Atlantis is a giant water world above and below the ocean floor, spearheaded by Nekodus (Niels), the creator of Astraeos. He is a partner developer who does his own creative build-out. It lets us get a completely different take on what ARK can be. Dragontopia is being done in-house in parallel with Legacy of Santiago. Dragontopia will be mechanically exciting and visually splendid, but it's not going to be story-oriented in the way Lost Colony is.</p>



<p>Additionally, Genesis 1 is coming out alongside <strong>Bob's Tall Tales: Tides of Fortune</strong>, which is a pirate-themed gameplay upgrade. We're adding a full water world to Genesis 1, expanding it to a map-wide water area to sail ships around with physical water. Genesis 2 is coming out alongside <strong>Bob's Tall Tales: Galaxy Wars</strong>, which is a starship space battles gameplay overlay. We're letting you have a full space biome with asteroids and miniature planets around the seed ship.</p>



<p><strong>I wonder if there's an overarching theme there with two expansions themed around air combat?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Dragons are not too dissimilar from things we've done in the past, though we're making the flight more dynamic and momentum-based. Starships are a very different thing because we're dealing with local gravity. It's important that you're able to walk around and build inside the starships as they fly, and there is new tech involved with making that work.</p>



<h2 id="ark-2-reset"><a href="#ark-2-reset">The Narrative and Primitive Gameplay Reset of ARK 2</a></h2>



<p><strong>Finally, what can you tell us about ARK 2? It seems like we're going to have to wait <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-2-delayed-until-late-2024-ue5-remaster-of-ark-coming-this-august-with-rtx-direct-illumination-support/">a lot longer than originally planned</a> [<em>Ed. the latest estimate is 2028</em>]. </strong> </p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> We're taking a lot of the systems developed for ARK 2 and moving them into Legacy of Santiago because we'd like to get player feedback on them and prototype them to reduce risk. Every game can have an expansion pack that's a "miss," and you just move on, but if you have a whole new game that's a miss, it can be a company-ending thing. Legacy of Santiago is a way to see how features like the new combat perform in a live environment over time.</p>



<p><strong>Is it still meant to be a return to the original Dino theme, as well as more focused on solo play?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> The intention for ARK 2 would be to have smaller parties focus more on squad-based survival and primitive combat oriented gameplay, and less so some of the large-scale craziness that has made it difficult to balance a stable progression ramp. We're testing that stuff out in Legacy of Santiago. It has to be a reset for the setting of the title. You can't just keep increasing the "fantasy crazy factor" and expect that to hold indefinitely; it loses the thread. ARK: Survival Evolved set itself down an increasingly fantastical path, and by the end of Genesis 2, it had "jumped the space dolphin." It’s necessary to bring it back down to dinosaurs and primitive physicality. The sci-fi is treated as an unknown, quasi-legendary mystical element, but it's not there in the player's mechanical gameplay. It’s used as an antagonistic force that you fight against.</p>

              <p><span>We’re just one week away from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>Electronic Arts shutting down </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>, BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-the-kotaku-review-1832885378"><span>questionable 2019 looter shooter detour</span></a><span> that failed to take off and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-says-it-s-giving-up-on-anthem-1846347391"><span>never got the second chance the RPG studio had promised</span></a><span>. According to the initial announcement, fans who bought the game would still be able to play it up until it finally goes offline forever on January 12. However, as the end date gets closer, some players who are trying to go take their Javelins out for one last spin have discovered they’re no longer able to open the game.</span></p> <p><span>We first took notice of this after seeing a few posts on X from users with screenshots showing that they were no longer able to download </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> after previously purchasing it at some point over the past seven years. The EA app instead told them they “don’t own” the game. I asked around and a friend who had the game through the EA Play subscription tried to download it to his PC and was told “this game is no longer offered in our catalog.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anthem is shutting down for good in a week, so I thought I'd play one more time.</p> <p>The EA App won't even let me download it even though I own it. <a href="https://t.co/spVNJd9six">pic.twitter.com/spVNJd9six</a></p> <p>— DansGaming (@Dansgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dansgaming/status/2008182733173141618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As others have  also reported, EA won't let me download Anthem, even though it shuts down a week from now… No "last hurrah" I guess. Crazy that I bought the game and can't even download it while it's still, allegedly, alive… <a href="https://t.co/cRu0s4DU1N">pic.twitter.com/cRu0s4DU1N</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2008212887026741530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>However, this doesn’t seem to be a universal issue, as </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Ethan Gach was able to download without issue from the EA Play app.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case may be, it seems like at least some </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>players who may have wanted to give the game one last try before BioWare and EA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>needlessly send it tumbling down into a digital void</span></a><span> aren’t able to now. The mech shooter hasn’t&nbsp; been available for purchase since the original shutdown announcement back in July, but if you had a copy of it in your library or on a disc, you were supposed to have one more week to play it.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to EA and BioWare for comment on the situation, and will update this story if we hear back. This whole thing could’ve been avoided if BioWare had made </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> accessible offline, but the studio claims it “was designed to be an online-only title.” That’s in contrast to other failed live-service gambits like </span><i><span>Redfall</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, both of which received offline modes before being sent off to pasture. </span></p>

          <p>We’ll admit that we weren’t paying enough attention to the state of <em>Anthem</em>—BioWare’s troubled 2019 jetpack-powered open-world shooter—to notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250703185925/https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">EA’s July announcement</a> that it was planning to shut down the game’s servers. But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare’s most ambitious failures.</p>
<p><em>Anthem</em> was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/bioware-anthem-e3-release-date/">unveiled</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/biowares-sci-fi-gaming-wizards-unveil-new-series-called-anthem/">E3 2017</a> in a demo that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/inside-look-at-bioware-explains-exactly-how-fake-e3-2017s-anthem-demo-was/">later revealed to have been largely faked</a> to paper over major issues with the game’s early development. <em>Anthem’</em>s&nbsp;early 2019 release was met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem">a lot of middling-to-poor reviews</a> (including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">one from Ars itself</a>), followed about a year later by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/bioware-promises-substantial-reinvention-for-year-old-anthem/">promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson</a> that a “longer-term redesign” and “substantial reinvention” of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2020/12/03/from-casey-hudson/">left BioWare in December 2020</a>, though, and a few months later, that planned <em>Anthem</em> overhaul <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/ea-bioware-cancel-anthems-sweeping-overhaul/">was officially canceled</a>.</p>
<p>While active development on <em>Anthem</em> has been dormant for years, the game’s servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn’t exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, <a href="https://mmo-population.com/game/anthem">estimates from MMO Populations</a> suggest a few hundred to a few thousand players have been jetpacking around the game’s world daily. The game also still sees <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame">a smattering of daily</a> subreddit posts, including some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q3hjpc/is_there_a_chance_to_make_a_private_server_of/">hoping against hope for a fan-led private server revival</a>, a la <a href="https://pretendo.network/">the Pretendo Network</a>. And there are still <a href="https://streamscharts.com/games/anthem">a small handful of Twitch streamers</a> sharing the game while they still can, including one racing to obtain all of the in-game achievements after <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2661748161">picking up a $4 copy at Goodwill</a>.</p>

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 developer Warhorse has revealed one feature that it cut from the RPG because it was too weird and not very fun.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nearly-had-a-san-andreas-like-fat-henry-system-that-would-have-let-you-create-bohemias-chunkiest-boy-and-forced-you-to-wear-clothes-that-fit-to-boot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, executive producer Martin Klima said this feature was a <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Eating" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GTA: San Andreas-like eating system</a> where main character Henry could gain and lose weight depending on food consumption. This would also affect what Henry would be able to wear.</p><p>The version of Kingdom Come 2 that launched in February 2025 allows players to put on any piece of clothing they find. But it wasn't always this way. In earlier stages of development, Klima said, "Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you."</p><p>If players found a piece of clothing or armor that was too big for them, they would be able to eat a bunch of food to grow in size. Alternatively, players could cut back on chowing down to shrink into smaller clothes. "When you eat, basically, you would get fatter, and then this clothing you have in your inventory suddenly <em>will</em> fit you, while the clothing you had previously wouldn't fit you, because now you're too fat for it. Or you could go on a diet and do the same process in reverse," Klima said.</p><p>In the end, the feature didn't make it into the game for a few different reasons. "It was just really too bizarre and too much work and not really that much fun," Klima said. "We felt that the clothing system is quite complex as it is, and it really doesn't need another layer of complexity."</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 is on sale for just $30 right now on Amazon.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come 2 review</a> scored the game a 9/10.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-z-dbz-popularity-poll/</link>
            <guid>1397701</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I, like many other anime fans reared up on Toonami, love <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. It’s GOATed. Its characters are iconic. Everyone has tried to go Super Saiyan at least once in their lives. But one thing that’s never happened in the 40 years of the late Akira Toriyama’s seminal shonen series is a popularity poll, until now. All I care about is that Goku’s second-born son loses against Bulma’s family cat.&nbsp;</p><p>The official <em>Dragon Ball</em> Twitter account announced the series’s first-ever global popularity poll in celebration of the series’ 40th anniversary. In the typical <em>DBZ </em>style of doing too much, the popularity poll is a three-stage, elimination-style bracket, whittling 212 characters down to 20, with an added losers' bracket where fans can will their favorite characters back into the running. I couldn't care less who wins the damn thing come the big reveal on January 24, I just need Goten to lose. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_l2r4iyFm60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="DRAGON BALL THE ONE　全世界キャラクター人気投票　開幕PV"></iframe></figure><p>Popularity polls are a staple of Shonen Jump series, with manga like <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Popularity_Polls?ref=aftermath.site#Results"><em><u>One Piece</u></em></a>, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Character_Popularity_Polls?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Naruto</u></em></a>, <a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Popularity_polls?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Bleach</u></em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1978314144068886682?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>My Hero Academia</u></em></a>, and <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Popularity_Polls?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Chainsaw Man</u></em></a> routinely incorporating them during their runs. They serve two purposes. One, it lets the creator know which character in his overstuffed ensemble fans mess with most, so they can give that character a narrative push in later arcs and movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/naruto99-sakura-sasuke-masashi-kishimoto-shonen-jump-1850337464?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fandom vindication with an overrated character actually topping the charts</u></a>, or a special post-series one-shot chapter. Or, in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/1nj5w2m/dont_fall_for_the_popularity_voting_fujimoto_will/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fujimoto’s case</u></a>, they let him know which characters fans like so he can kill them off in the most emotionally devastating way possible. These polls, which usually coincide with a color-spread illustration by the mangaka, are also a hotbed for fans to throw obscure characters into the mix. <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s popularity poll in 2021 had “characters” like Kobeni’s car, and that car ends up being more popular than Kobeni herself.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Shonen Jump</span></figcaption></figure><p>While <em>Dragon Ball</em> has had an array of character and best bout polls, it hasn’t had a global popularity poll of this scale before. And with <em>DBZ </em>fans having spent years watching how other fandoms have operated in popularity polls, they’ve unsurprisingly followed suit, with some deep-pull characters placing high in the poll’s early stages.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— DRAGON BALL OFFICIAL (@DB_official_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/DB_official_en/status/1991795046686118204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Said deep-pull characters all share one commonality: they’re of the “Toriyama forgot” variety. Tertiary characters that the father of shonen has forgotten he even wrote, as he escalated the series to the dizzying height it sits upon today. Characters like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YHy1Gmw-dA&amp;pp=ygUia290YWt1IGRyYWdvbiBiYWxsIGJyZWFrZXJzIGZhcm1lcg%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Farmer who shot Raditz</u></a> at the beginning of <em>DBZ </em>and the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dbz-what-happened-to-dragon-ball-launch/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>personality-switching heroine, Launch</u></a>, who got left in <em>Dragon Ball </em>obscurity forever, managed to be contenders in the poll’s early stages. Still, the <em>DBZ </em>popularity poll's implementation of a losers bracket across its three voting stages, giving lesser-known characters a chance to rise the ranks, made the whole affair the most stressful manga popularity poll watch of my life. Mind you, this isn’t because I have a vested interest in whether they have a snowball's chance in hell to upset the poll’s secured top five favorites like Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, and Vegito by the time the dust has settled. I just want Goten, Goku’s second-born son, to lose out to the Brief’s family cat, <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Scratch?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tama</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Toei Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Scratch?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tama</u></a>, known as Scratch in the English dub, is a pitch-black, cat-shaped pool with two beady eyes. His sole purpose in life is to sit atop Dr. Brief’s shoulders, and he excels at this task. While Tama doesn’t play a significant role in the manga or anime—aside from witnessing Dr. Brief create the spaceship that sent Goku to Namek, the gravity chamber where Vegeta trained, and helping rehabilitate Android 16 from his villainous ways—he has accomplished some impressive feats. Notably, he has lived for over 30 years in <em>Dragon Ball</em>'s timeline without aging. Dr. Brief, the scientist behind Capsule Corp, even claims that Tama has as much experience with technology as he does. In fact, Dr. Briefs once told Chichi, "No one can troubleshoot a frozen oscillator like we can,” referring to himself and Tama. Was this nothing more than a platitude from a cat owner suffering from severe toxoplasmosis? Perhaps. But after looking into the head-empty abyss behind Tama’s black eyes, I believe him, and I want him to trounce Goten at any cost.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Toei Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p>My loathing for <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goten?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Goten </u></a>is both petty and circumstantial. On a hereditary level, I dislike Goten because Chi-Chi’s genes gave up entirely and plopped out a carbon copy of Goku, sans any of his personality. He’s got Goku’s haircut. He’s got Goku’s gi (with long sleeves, ooo!). But aside from being an airhead like his absentee father, Goten’s got nothing else going for him. If anything, he’s a <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Memberberries?ref=aftermath.site"><u>memberberry</u></a> on Toriyama’s part for how <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shineyezehuhh.bsky.social/post/3maz6lo6pms2r?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">cute kid Goku in<em> Dragon Ball</em></a> was before its gag manga antics were shoved to the side for the scowling, shonen powerscaling rule of cool the series played a pivotal part in popularizing for the entire industry. All of which makes it the more fucked up that Goten never really stood a chance to get out of his father’s shadow by literally cosplaying as the man (who he wouldn’t meet until he turned seven on account of Goku dying at the Cell Games).&nbsp;</p><p>Before folks start playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0CQf3JDKAY&amp;list=RDZ0CQf3JDKAY&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUadHlsZXIgdGhlIGNyZWF0b3IgbGlrZSBoaW2gBwE%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tyler, The Creator’s “Like Him</u></a>,” on some pity party shit, know that I do not weep for Goten. He had his chance to make something non-derivative of himself. But even after having a chance to grow out of his father’s shadow by radically changing his looks in the bemoaned spin-off, <em>Dragon Ball GT</em>, he got jobbed by an alien named Baby. In totality, the most remarkable thing Goten did was be half of the Super Saiyan fusion Gotenks with Vegeta’s spawn, Trunks—a character who's got way more interesting shit going for him. So, in an admittedly petty sense of circumstantial hate meeting longtime apathy, I’d rather see Goten lose pretty handily to a house cat.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— DRAGON BALL OFFICIAL (@DB_official_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/DB_official_en/status/1994332313946333605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>On November 28, much to my annoyance, the second stage of the popularity poll ranking, showcasing the top 40 characters, had Goten overtake Bulma’s family cat, placing 12th while Tama sat at 20th place. In so doing, he smoked Android 17, Yamcha, Chichi, Tien, Launch, Bulma, and Videl to get there. Because <em>DBZ </em>is extra, on December 1, the official Twitter account shared a new poll update, with arrows showing where characters were slipping back and which were climbing the ranks.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📣 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DB1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#DB1</a> [2nd Stage] Results!<br>These are the characters moving on to the 3rd Stage!<br>See any changes since our last update? 👀</p><p>Stay tuned for the Revival Battle!<br>1 of the characters who didn't make it to the top 40 will be brought back!<br>Check the next post! <a href="https://t.co/oAyrsNjHIs?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/oAyrsNjHIs</a></p></div>— DRAGON BALL OFFICIAL (@DB_official_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/DB_official_en/status/1995690549681291293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>To my jubilation, Goten dropped to 16th place, while Tama moved up one place. Reader, I couldn’t help but try to stifle the Light Yamagi-esque smile that stretched across my face, seeing that fraud get one step closer to having a joke character rightfully usurp him.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LKBOTPmLvwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="&quot;No I can't laugh yet they're all gonna die.&quot; Death Note"></iframe></figure><p>Logging on to Twitter on December 5 was nothing short of euphoric. While Tama had slid back to 20th place, Goten was nowhere to be seen. All was right with the world for a moment.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— DRAGON BALL OFFICIAL (@DB_official_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/DB_official_en/status/1996867972321947963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>That is, until December 8th, when that fucking rugrat climbed back from the loser’s bracket. But we weren’t cooked yet, chat. Goten only placed at 17th while Tama stood above him at 16th place. There was still room to dream, right? Well, if you know <em>DBZ </em>fans as I do, you would know that they’re a bunch of <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Ape?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Oozaru</u></a> apes who hate gag manga funsies and favor anything and everything that involves “hype moments and aura.” Which brings us to the final stage ranking update on December 19th. Goten somehow rose up to rank 15, and the valiant Tama had sunk to 17th.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— DRAGON BALL OFFICIAL (@DB_official_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/DB_official_en/status/2002212767294697978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Before I could yell the tried and true cry of “Stop the polls,” the dust all but settled on December 23, with the Dragon Ball Twitter account announcing that voting for the final stage of the popularity polls had closed. To add even more <em>Marty Supreme</em>-levels stress to my already tension-filled holidays, the account teased a guessing game where folks could predict who placed in the top 7 by posting the corresponding letters of the alphabet next to each character in a seven-letter sequence in the replies. Reading entirely too much into it, I couldn’t help but notice that while Goten and Tama were in the bottom row, Goten was given the letter “S” while Tama was given the letter “U.” This all but told me passively that the runt had stolen victory from the jaws of defeat by being placed in (albeit randomized) alphabetical importance above Bulma’s family cat and fucking <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Vegito?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Vegito</u></a> of all people.&nbsp;</p><p>But I believe in Tama. So much so that I’m willing to place a bet. If Tama doesn't place higher than Goten by the time the results are posted on YouTube on January 24th, I’ll do something I’ve sworn never to do. I’ll finally read <em>Boruto</em>. I mean it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D478M9VJv_0&amp;pp=ygUhZGVhciBnb2QgcGxlYXNlIGtpbGwgcGV0ZXIgcGFya2Vy0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dear god, let Goten lose</u></a>. </p>

When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> rocks up, rakes in a bunch of success and critical acclaim, alongside the top game of the year prize at Geoffie's Lil Night of Ads, there will be certain expectations of what's next. It's always what's next! Because there has to be more. But whatever more ends up being for developer Sandfall Interactive, the team is trying to make sure they don't just bow down to what people want from them.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>) in a recent interview, chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse shared that he feels "a bit of pressure" from both lovers and critics of the game for the studio's follow-up, but ultimately "it's not so important to us." He went on to say that they'll have "time to get really focused into the next game. We have some great ideas we're so excited to explore, and we don't start from the same point. The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff."
</p>
<p>
Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who apparently had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-lead-writer-had-apparently-never-played-a-video-game-before-writing-it">never played a game before writing this one</a>, echoed these thoughts, even if she did note that she's "a bit of a people pleaser." With that in mind, she says it's "always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game." 
</p>
<p>
Svedberg-Yen does admit to thinking about these expectations from time to time, but when it comes to creative decisions, they always make sure to be guided by their own personal taste as opposed to what people want from them. "I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," she said. "So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."
</p>
<p>
Let's just cross our fingers that whatever's next causes just a bit less discourse about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. Please. I've had enough.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Late last month, an old video showing off what a hypothetical AAA<em> Mario</em> game would look like went viral after two voice actors added new dialogue styled after that in blockbuster games like <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Gears of War.</em> Now, a few weeks later, one line from the game, “Focus, M,” has spread across all corners of the web, annoying some and leading to a lot of online discourse.</p> <p>On December 23, voice actor Ryan Stewart uploaded a video featuring himself as Mario and another voice actor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielhckva/?utm_source=ig_embed">Ariel Hack</a>, as Peach, talking to each other over comms as the famous plumber approaches Bowser’s castle. The original gameplay video featured in Stewart’s post was created by Funkyzeit as a conceptual mock-up of what a AAA Mario game might look like, and was shared online back in 2022. This new version, featuring dialogue perfectly parodying how some AAA games deliver narrative and tutorial information, quickly went viral online, with Stewart’s Twitter upload reaching over 25 million views as of January 5.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had no idea AAA Mario would be so popular. I had to make some more. 🍄<br>ft. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielHck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArielHck</a> as Peach <a href="https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn">https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn</a> <a href="https://t.co/ggarxptMuZ">pic.twitter.com/ggarxptMuZ</a></p> <p>— Ryan Stewart (@RyanStewartVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanStewartVO/status/2002854369369452879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Quickly, one phrase from the video became popular: “Focus, M.” This line is delivered by Hack’s Peach after Mario makes a joke. It’s a pitch-perfect replication of the kind of AAA video game dialogue that was so prevalent in blockbuster single-player games from the Xbox 360 and PS4 generations, and which can still be found in some bigger games now. All of this dialogue, including the “Focus, M” line, was written by Stewart himself, who told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he didn’t expect the bit to go as viral as it has, he knew he had a “banger” on his hands once he heard it.</p>

 <p>“As I was writing the dialogue, I knew it was funny,” said Stewart via email. “Once I got Ariel’s reads in, though, I knew it would be a banger. That being said, the sheer amount of discussion it spawned after the fact was unexpected.”</p>

 <p>When asked for his thoughts on how “Focus, M” has become its own meme, with people using it who haven’t even seen the original video, Stewart told <em>Kotaku</em>:&nbsp; “If nothing else, I think it’s resulted in some excellent fan art! I hope my future posts can do the same.”</p>

 <p>While Stewart is pretty positive about “Focus, M,” some online aren’t. The original creator behind the AAA Mario video never replied to <em>Kotaku’s</em> request for comment, <a href="https://x.com/KingOfSuper/status/2004602334975001002">but did like a YouTube comment left by someone comparing them to Oppenheimer</a>, the man who created the nuclear bomb. That seems to indicate that, at the very least, Funkyzeit has mixed feelings about their involvement in “Focus, M.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, online, the “Focus, M” meme has rapidly evolved and spread. You can find people applying it to basically anything at this point. <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">New <em>Marathon</em> graphics?</a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenobladeus.bsky.social/post/3maxn33scsk2x">PS1 platformer <em>Croc?</em></a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://x.com/freakofxeets/status/2004670291704942597"><em>Starfield</em>?</a> Sure, whatever, that’s a “Focus, M” game, too.</p>

 <p>At this point, the meme has already run its course and lost all meaning. It’s like people calling anything they don’t like slop. And you can find plenty of posts from people saying they feel the meme is dead already. I’m not so sure, though. I still regularly see people tagging new AAA games and remasters as “Focus, M” games. And I suspect that at least a few devs have been watching all of this and are possibly making some tweaks to dialogue in their own upcoming games. I feel certain that at least one game has likely removed or cut a line that asked the player to “Focus…” in response to all of this.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Clair Obscur Expedition 33 Is GameSpot's Game of the Year 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Many are derived from French, the home country of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive. For example, the Machinapieds enemy is simply "Machine with feet" in French, while the Licorne enemy is French for unicorn. Some enemies are a combination of French words or a wordplay on French phrases. Barbasucette is a combination of the French words for beard and lollipop, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Other names are based on what that particular enemy does. The Potier is French for potter, since that enemy throws pots, while the flying Volster enemies are derived from Vol, the French word for fly. The rolling ball-shaped Petank enemies are named after the French boules game Petanque.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some names that don't fit into those categories and are more one-off references. The Gestral Ono Puncho is a reference to the popular anime and manga series One-Punch Man, while another, Limonsol, is labeled in the files as an "inside joke" with no additional context.</p><p dir="ltr">As for why Sandfall Interactive went out of its way to link Wikipedia articles and explain the meaning behind all the game's names within its files, fans are theorizing it was done for the benefit of localization teams in order to help convey the meaning behind characters into different languages.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ended 2025 with a bang, with one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">final free update adding new boss fights</a> amidst the game taking home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-shattering number of awards</a>, including Game of the Year, at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">2025's The Game Awards</a>. It was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's 2025 Game of the Year</a>. The game's runaway success even saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/president-of-france-takes-a-turn-congratulating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/1100-6536961/" data-ref-id="1100-6536961">French President Emmanuel Macron</a> congratulate Sandfall Interactive for its work.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Sandfall's next game, it's unclear if it will be a sequel of sorts to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, with the game's director having previously confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-is-the-franchise-name-says-sandfall-as-it-stays-coy-on-what-comes-after-expedition-33/1100-6534302/" data-ref-id="1100-6534302">Clair Obscur is the name of a "franchise"</a> and that Expedition 33 is merely one story within it. The studio knows expectations are now high for whatever comes next, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-doesnt-just-want-to-be-people-pleaser-with-next-game/1100-6537165/" data-ref-id="1100-6537165">doesn't want its next game to be a "people-pleaser,"</a> according to Sandfall lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen.</p>

                <p>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jet-set-radio-2000/" data-ref-id="5000-134083">Jet Set Radio</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3987">Pac-Man World 2</a>.</p><p>Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man.

If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wl0fD-h9mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wl0fD-h9mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.</p><p>AGDQ started on Monday, January 4 and runs until Sunday, January 11.

<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2026-01-05T19:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 5th Jan 2026, 7:35pm</time>]:</strong> After the initial tease way back in April last year, publisher Electric Airship has finally confirmed that Kasey Ozymy's fantastic surreal RPG, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass, is coming to Switch on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Heavily inspired by SNES RPGs while putting its own unique dreamlike twist on the genre, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass' console port is more than just that, with the brand new trailer (up top) teasing "new never-before-seen levels!", new enemies, enhanced visuals, a CRT filter, new fonts, and even more.</p>
<p>Blending horror elements with all of those classic retro RPG tropes, Jimmy's adventures in his dreams promise to be memorable and emotional.</p>
<p>For more info, check out this summary from the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/706560/Jimmy_and_the_Pulsating_Mass/">Steam page</a> and check out our original story from last year below...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</em> is a Japanese-style RPG made by a guy from Texas. It was very much influenced by SNES-era jRPGs, particularly <em>Earthbound</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 5</em>, and the <em>Breath of Fire</em> series, among others. It was also heavily influenced by <em>Yume Nikki</em>.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the dream of an eight-year-old boy. When an alien entity appears and threatens his family and the stability of the dream world itself, Jimmy sets out on an adventure to save his family and eradicate the threat of the Pulsating Mass. Along the way, Jimmy will have to work with his family, confront his own shortcomings, and brave the creeping nightmares of his subconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Features:<br></strong>-Full-length Japanese-style RPG.<br>
-Classic turn-based combat with some modern sensibilities.<br>
-A big emphasis on exploration.<br>
-As an empathetic kid, Jimmy gains the ability to imagine himself as several of the monsters he meets, allowing him to interact with the world in new ways.<br>
-These different transformations can also be leveled up, granting Jimmy higher stats and new abilities.<br>
-A story for adults delivered from the perspective of a child.<br>
-Jokes.<br>
-Unspeakable horrors.</p>
</blockquote><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Wed 16th Apr, 2025 19:30 BST</strong>: We all know just how influential <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a> is at this point. Despite initially underselling and putting people off with weird marketing campaigns, the game (and, in turn, series) is one of the most beloved games on the SNES. So it's no wonder that EarthBound-inspired games are a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>Here's one that may have flown under the radar for many, however — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jimmy_and_the_pulsating_mass">Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</a> from solo developer Kasey Ozymy, a "guy from Texas" who loves Japanese and Japanese-style RPGs. His debut game, made entirely in RPG Maker, launched on Steam and itch.io in August 2018. And now, Ozymy's studio, Starseed Games, is partnering with publisher Electric Airship to bring the turn-based RPG to all consoles, including Switch.</p>
<p>We don't have a date yet, or anything else besides a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/electricairship.com/post/3lmrjrnqbzh26">Bluesky</a> from Electric Airship stating "we are working with Starseed Games". But it's something.</p>

<p>With fewer than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/706560/Jimmy_and_the_Pulsating_Mass/">500 Steam reviews</a>, and only a handful of mostly-glowing reviews from smaller outlets such as <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/jimmy-and-the-pulsating-mass-review-a-work-of-genius-and-empathy-makes-this-jrpg-a-new-classic-that-should-not-be-ignored/">Gaming Trend</a>, <a href="https://www.cubed3.com/">Cubed3</a>, and <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/jimmy-and-the-pulsating-mass/">RPGFan</a> (where, full disclosure, the author of this news article is a former writer at RPGFan), not many people are talking about it. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAAXdU8SZw0&amp;ab_channel=NitroRad">Nitro Rad also produced a video</a> on the game prior to release. And, from what we've heard, this sounds like a must-play for fans of EarthBound.</p>
<p>Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass isn't just inspired by Nintendo's subversive American-set RPG; it also takes cues from the <strong>Breath of Fire</strong> series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a>, and horror indie hit <strong>Yume Nikke</strong>. Boasting over 40 hours of content, the entire game takes place inside the dream of an eight-year-old boy called Jimmy.</p>
<p>It's got first-person turn-based combat just like Dragon Quest, but you have the ability to actually transform into some foes — as long as they're not controlled by the game's big bad, the titular Pulsating Mass. There are horrifying nightmarish dungeons, tons of sidequests, and a beautiful story at the centre of it all.</p>

<p>So, we'll be keeping an eye out for this one, then. In the meantime, you can sign up to the <a href="https://airport.electricairship.com/jimmy/">publisher's website</a> to get more details on Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass' console release and other indie RPGs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ series finale continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. While plenty of people were fine with how the Netflix horror series wrapped up after a decade, there’s a loud subset of fans who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking to the digital streets</span></a><span> to tear it down, say awful things about the people who worked on it, and declare it the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>next </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>-level failure</span></a><span>. Another fraction of that group, however, is holding onto a bizarre sliver of hope with the belief that perhaps the disappointing conclusion is not all it seems. The movement, which is calling itself Conformity Gate, has gathered “evidence” indicating that the events depicted in the finale are actually an illusion and that there is still a battle left to fight, which will play out in a secret episode that’s not available on Netflix right now.</span></p>  <p><span>Obviously, we’ll be discussing the fifth season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> here, so if you want to stay spoiler free, you should leave now. (Really, you probably shouldn’t have opened this article to begin with.) But the tl;dr of the theory is that the sterile and rushed nature of the finale is an intentional creative choice meant to reflect that it takes place in a distorted reality created by Vecna and everyone in the show is “conforming” to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Admittedly, I fully planned to just roll my eyes at all this pretty wild speculation because I lived through the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>ending controversy and the Indoctrination Theory, which fans believed explained that game’s finale as a hallucination but was really just a way for them to cope with not liking the way things turned out. But, I don’t know, there’s </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>compelling evidence in the theory, both based on what’s in the show and on how Netflix and show creators the Duffer Brothers have talked about it since.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many of these details are subtle, such as the way that characters sit during the graduation scene resembling how villain Vecna sits at other points in the series, whereas others seem to be pretty overt, like Max calling out Mike’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>epilogue for being too comforting, as if something is off. Here’s one of the quicker rundowns I could find, by @meechski on TikTok, but you can also find </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAQbdjjaJk&amp;pp=ygUfY29uZm9ybWl0eSBnYXRlIHN0cmFuZ2VyIHRoaW5ncw%3D%3D"><span>much lengthier breakdowns on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>Also, as someone in the comments of that video points out, if you search “conformity gate” or “fake ending” on Netflix, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is the only search result for the latter, and one of two for the former alongside </span><i><span>Emily in Paris</span></i><span>. Make of that what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know that any one thing made me a full-blown believer, but taken all together, it was enough for me to at least become interested in seeing if it actually pans out. Conspiracy theories usually have at least </span><i><span>some</span></i><span> shred of plausibility that allows them to gain some traction, but they also tend to be made up of a lot of square pegs shoved into round holes. All these pieces of evidence could just be coincidences born of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>bad writing</span></a><span> and desperation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">guys… notice how all of them are reading WHITE scripts when shawn levy confirmed the finale was printed on RED scripts… they are trying to confuse us with that trailer. i AM sure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/confirmitygate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#confirmitygate</a> <a href="https://t.co/Pje0LF13dm">pic.twitter.com/Pje0LF13dm</a></p> <p>— ʅǝɯ | ੈ✩‧₊˚ (@melinastapes) <a href="https://twitter.com/melinastapes/status/2008186236830421086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Luckily, we won’t really have to wait long for these hopes to be shattered, as the entire theory hinges on this hypothetical secret finale premiering on January 7, when Netflix is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfaW74zJlmk"><span>planning to announce something about its 2026 programming</span></a><span>. Of course, I don’t want any </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans to have to suffer a worse ending than the one they’d hoped for, but after witnessing the behavior of some members of the community in the wake of a disappointing finale, I’m also wondering if those who have said some truly heinous things about the people who worked on this show even deserve a better ending.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hytale-vampire-survivors-mod-early-access-steam-minecraft-2000656708</link>
            <guid>1397608</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hypixel Studios, developer of the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired survival game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, has shown the sandbox game’s modding capabilities with a </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors-</span></i><span>like prototype that has fans excited ahead of the game’s Early Access launch later this month. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658"><span>social media post</span></a><span> over the weekend, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared a 40-second gameplay clip showcasing a character fending off voxel-based hordes of enemies in a top-down view arena.</span></p> <p><span>According to Collins-Laflamme, the video shows a </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> mod created by a team member in their spare time, and it’s intended as a proof-of-concept demo for “how different genres” could be realized within the game by fans and modders.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following video showcases a server-side Hytale mod created by a Hytale team member in their spare time. It’s intended purely as inspiration for how different genres could be realized within Hytale! </p> <p>The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding… <a href="https://t.co/YaszQv9kDb">pic.twitter.com/YaszQv9kDb</a></p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding capabilities and was used to build a simple, survivor-like experience,” Collins-Laflamme wrote. While the mod is not planned for release as part of the game, Hypixel “may publish it – or similar examples – as reference material for the community.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The video comes less than two months after Hypixel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-hypixel-riot-canceled-revived-gameplay-minecraft-2000645466"><span>reacquired the rights</span></a><span> to</span><i><span> Hytale </span></i><span>from </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> maker Riot Games, which had previously canceled the project in June of last year. The team released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-price-low-minecraft-hypixel-2000646230"><span>16-minute gameplay trailer shortly afterwards</span></a><span>, but the latest clip is focused on </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> potential to be a springboard for user-generated content like the Mojang hit that inspired it.</span></p>

 <h2>Hytale is gearing up for Early Access</h2> <p><span>“My prediction is, it will do very well initially and then it will slow down until the modders / servers and us start to release some major content and then it will keep growing for years to come. Especially as we add more modding tools and options,” Collins-Laflamme </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006936928026026273"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span>, responding to a user who suggested that </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> release “will probably be something huge.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The reply came from a larger thread in which the co-founder expressed feeling “anger” as the studio gets closer to the early access launch of this new version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which is slated for January 13. According to Collins-Laflamme, that’s due to pouring four years of engineering into rebuilding the game’s engine rather than working on gameplay features. In his eyes, that leaves the team with a “four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do,” alongside a rebuilt engine that is “never gonna be used.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As previously </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"><span>stated by the developer in a FAQ</span></a><span>, the sandbox won’t be available on Steam at launch in order to focus on its existing community. That’s to avoid chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.” Hypixel explained that while it doesn’t shy away from “honest, negative criticism,” the team is more interested in feedback from players who are already familiar with the game’s development background.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most importantly, the FAQ notes that Steam “currently doesn’t support” some of </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> modding features, and that the developer “will be in contact with Valve in the near future” to try and fix that. Otherwise it might be a while before Steam users get to recreate the platform’s latest hits inside</span><i><span> Hytale</span></i><span>. </span></p>

			<p>2025 was <strong>an explosive year for shooter games</strong>. The schedule of the new year is also quite juicy, mostly thanks to <strong>Xbox Studios</strong> releasing two games based on its heavy-hitting shooter franchises in the same year: Halo Campaign Evolved and Gears of War E-Day. <span>Those two, plus Bungie's Marathon, are arguably the&nbsp;<strong>most anticipated shooter games of 2026</strong>&nbsp;based on what we currently know, but history has shown there can always be interesting surprises throughout the year.</span> Scroll down below to read our full shortlist and the honorable mentions, too.</p>

<h2 id="h-highguard-january-26-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Highguard (January 26, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Highguard-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Out of all the shooter games on this list, <strong>Highguard</strong> was the one <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced most recently</a>, and yet it is also going to be the first to hit the market. It was the final reveal at <strong>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025</strong> event, and that didn't do it any favors, as many viewers complained the show should have ended on a higher note.</p>



<p>Still, that doesn't mean Highguard won't be fun. The game is being developed by a new studio called <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, a remote-first company founded by former developers who worked on <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, <strong>Titanfall</strong>, and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. The game is a competitive 'raid shooter' where the player characters, called <strong>Wardens</strong>, who are arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Players will fight rival Warden crews for control of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure victory. The gameplay footage demonstrated fairly large maps where players will also ride mounts like horses, panthers, and bears. There's definitely a bit of a fantasy vibe, with several characters showcasing magic skills. Whether that will be enough to make it unique remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-march-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Marathon (March 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Marathon-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Bungie</strong>'s first new project since 2014's <strong>Destiny</strong> uses one of its historical franchises, <strong>Marathon</strong>. The upcoming installment launches thirty years after the previous entry, <strong>Marathon Infinity</strong>. This new game is fundamentally different, though: it's modeled after the increasingly popular <strong>extraction shooter</strong>. </p>



<p>Bungie plans to differentiate Marathon from existing extraction shooters by replacing generic characters with the so-called <strong>Runner Shells</strong>, bio-cybernetic hero archetypes like <strong>Stealth,</strong> <strong>Medic</strong>, and <strong>Destroyer</strong>, each possessing unique tactical abilities. The gameplay loop incorporates high-stakes, "raid-like" endgame scenarios on the <strong>UESC Marathon ship</strong>, where players must navigate security measures to claim high-tier artifacts.</p>



<p>The title emphasizes a persistent narrative through seasonal faction progression and <strong>The Codex</strong>, a system that tracks player achievements and non-linear story discoveries. There's also a dedicated <strong>Rook</strong> mode for solo players to scavenge in matches already in progress. Bungie also promised a player-friendly live-service model featuring <strong>non-expiring battle passes</strong> and a <strong>$39.99</strong> price point. </p>



<p>After several delays, we are now only around two months away from the game's launch. You can learn more about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our report based on the latest official ViDoc</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Halo: Campaign Evolved (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Halo_CampaignEvolved_Wallpaper-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>While Bungie, the original creator of the <strong>Halo </strong>series, readies its new Marathon game, the current caretakers of the Halo IP are remaking the game that made Bungie popular in the first place. Originally known as <strong>Halo: Combat Evolved</strong>, the 2001 release was the killer application of the first Xbox platform, as well as the first-person shooter that revolutionized the genre on consoles.</p>



<p>Following several rumors, <strong>Halo Studios</strong> (formerly known as <strong>343 Industries</strong>) has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the existence of <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, a remake that focuses exclusively on the story mode, eliminating the multiplayer modes. Just like Oblivion Remastered, the game's visuals will run on Unreal Engine 5<span>, while the original engine (<strong>Blam</strong>) will</span> handle the rest. Several changes have been confirmed, including the addition of vehicle hijacking, weapon zooming, a redesigned 4-man Warthog, the optional addition of sprinting, and several level design changes that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original level designer didn't take kindly to</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, Halo: Campaign Evolved <strong>will introduce the series to PlayStation users for the first time</strong>. It could be a way to revive its popularity after several games in a row that received mixed reactions from the gaming community.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-tba-2026-pc-xbox-series-s-and-x">Gears of War: E-Day (TBA 2026 - PC, Xbox Series S and X)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gears-of-war-e-day-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Apart from last year's <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded</strong>, fans of the third-person shooter franchise originally created by <strong>Epic Games</strong> haven't received a new mainline installment since <strong>2019's Gears 5</strong>. With <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though, developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborating with <strong>People Can Fly</strong></a>, a studio that previously worked on <strong>Gears of War Judgment</strong>, on this project) is ditching the semi-open world elements to tell a linear story once again.</p>



<p>Even so, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> that this one will be <strong>their most ambitious game yet</strong>. E-Day, as the title itself confirms, is set <strong>fourteen years before the events seen in the first Gears of War</strong>, on the day that the <strong>Locust Horde</strong> emerged on the surface of the planet <strong>Sera</strong>. The story will feature the two young COG soldiers, <strong>Marcus Fenix</strong> and <strong>Dom Santiago</strong>, as they attempt to survive the invasion in the city of Kalona (a brand new location never before seen in previous games).</p>



<h2 id="h-witchfire-tba-2026-pc">Witchfire (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>

<p>Polish indie developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong> is taking a very, very long time to make <strong>Witchfire</strong>. The studio's previous game, <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong>, was released in 2014, and their new project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-astronauts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> over eight years ago at <strong>The Game Awards 2017</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, The Astronauts is a very small team, and Witchfire is a lot more ambitious than their previous adventure game. A dark fantasy shooter with <strong>roguelite</strong> elements, the game delayed its early access debut to <strong>September 2023</strong> to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-is-delayed-to-2023-to-add-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world maps</a>. The game was initially available only on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> due to <strong>a timed exclusivity deal</strong> signed with Epic; the <strong>Steam</strong> early access version <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched exactly one year later</a>. Recently, the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-surpasses-500k-units-sold-gets-reckoning-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a major update</a> called '<strong>The Reckoning</strong>' and confirmed that the game has surpassed <strong>500K units sold</strong>. However, as with most early access games, the vast majority of gamers are still waiting for the final version, slated to launch in 2026, to play.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" rel="nofollow ">Wccftech</a>, Nvidia is reportedly on the verge of resuming production on its budget-friendly GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to combat the ongoing shortage of RAM being caused by an uptick in development on AI technologies and the increasing prices of memory.</p><p dir="ltr">Wccftech's reporting on these rumors seems to stem from a credible leaker of Nvidia GPU production news on Twitter called <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@hongxing2020</a>. According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲</p>  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days into 2026, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">reported</a> that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/" rel="nofollow ">preposterous</a>, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> popular graphics cards</a> around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4 Remake's</a> opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as "Chapter 0," in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Using leftover pieces from "Chapter 0" found in the game's files, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thekempy</a> has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra.</p><p dir="ltr">While the cutscenes for the cut chapter aren't found in the Resident Evil 4 remake's files, there are some leftover enemy spawn locations, scripted events triggers, auto-save locations, and even off-limit areas that help give an idea of what the chapter would have looked like.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear why this opening chapter, something that doesn't exist in the original Resident Evil 4, was cut prior to launch. Thekempy speculates Capcom's decision may have been related to pacing, as an opening chapter focusing on Ashley hiding and sneaking would have slowed down a game known for its non-stop action.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom is far from finished remaking Resident Evil games. Reports have indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">remakes of Resident Evil Zero and Code Veronica</a> may be coming in the next few years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-resident-evil-0-remake-will-flesh-out-originals-story-report/1100-6535568/" data-ref-id="1100-6535568">Resident Evil 0 remake reportedly looking to further flesh out</a> characters and plot details only alluded to in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, will bring back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leon-kennedy-is-back-in-resident-evil-requiem-and-now-he-has-a-chainsaw/1100-6536786/" data-ref-id="1100-6536786">Resident Evil 4's Leon S.
