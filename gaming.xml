<p>A trend of gambling-inspired games has surfaced in the wake of poker-like deckbuilding roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. The recipe? Take a standard game of chance you might find in any casino and mash an uncountable number of bells and whistles and gizmos and weirdnesses into it, then slather it in a "one more turn" roguelike dressing, and make it as tactile and punchy as humanly possible. The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> has no shortage of these gambley gimmickers, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/">here's one demo</a> that stood out. Ballionaire is a colourful pachinko-inspired roguelike, but you choose where the wacky widgets will go.</p>

<p>It's more straightforward than the chaos of that trailer makes out. You drop a ball from the top of the board and watch as it bounces its way down through the pins. You earn cash for each little bumper or bonkable doohickey the ball hits along the way. Some of these bumpers (called "triggers") will have special features. An axe will chop your ball in half, allowing it to fall in multiple directions, activating even more gadgets. A teleporter will zap your ball back to the top of the board, letting it fall all over again. You can get different types of ball, designed after the classical elements, such as fire, water, and chicken egg (placing an egg carton somewhere will catch the eggs for passive, eggy income). </p>
<p>It only gets wackier as you go from level to level, seeking bigger payouts to appease the gods. You could install a little patch of cacti, which earn money when <em>not</em> bonked, and then try and keep the ball away from them by surrounding the plants with other bumpers. Or you could get culinary, putting a tomato, some bread, and a block of cheese in a neat little cluster, which your ball will collect as it bonks each. Placing a frying pan underneath that will combine all these into a meal for extra dollars, before a big open mouth at the bottom of the board can scoff everything up.</p><p>Try the demo. Go on. Steam Next Fest is almost over (it ends on Monday) and this is a frivilous and fun hour of ball bonking (ahem). It's not the first time pachinko has served as inspiration for a video game, mind. Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peggle">Peggle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> owe something to the poppy pinging of the traditional Japanese gambling machine.</p>
<p>As for the recent upswell of gambling-themed games, there's reason to be thoughtful about this, and there are already enough questionable practices in the games industry when it comes to psychological tactics of free-to-play games and MMOs. But at least the developer of Balatro, for one, has considered such concerns, even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-be-seeing-the-balatro-ip-used-by-casinos-or-gambling-companies-the-developer-has-forbidden-it-in-his-will">writing into his will that the game should not be co-opted by the gambling industry</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was published on October 17 by Saber Interactive – but it was developed over several years by Stormind Games, an Italian studio. As an expansion to an established cinematic universe, The Road Ahead promised a nail-biting experience fraught with tension that was irrevocably linked to the core recipe of A Quiet Place.</p>



<p>What the team ultimately delivered is a relatively watered-down and linear walkthrough of an attractive world that’s far too easy to survive in for something post-apocalyptic and ideally quite harrowing. </p>



<p>Read on to check out my full A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-light-on-the-survival">Light on the Survival</h2>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead starts nicely and progresses at a balanced pace. It alternates between the present-day apocalypse and flashback sequences that help to set the scene and build the world. It’s possible to enjoy The Road Ahead without ever having seen one of the movies, but if you’re here, <strong>you’ve probably seen one of the movies</strong>.</p>



<p>The story isn’t overwhelmingly immersive and it’s mostly predictable, but it’s good enough to keep things steaming along. It becomes fraught very early on, and some fundamental twists will make the player feel much more invested in what’s happening to Alex Taylor, the title’s protagonist.</p>



<p>As a ‘survival horror’ game, The Road Ahead is light on survival and moderate on horror.</p>



<p>There are plenty of jumpscares to claw your way past, and the need to stay silent <strong>all the time </strong>can feel quite intense. It’s a helpful way of slowing down the game, though – which only comes in at around six hours if you’re able to progress without being killed too much by the fearsome creatures.</p>



<p>The survival elements are thin to none, though. Despite being in an apocalyptic setting, there’s nothing to ‘loot’ despite a few basic resources, and there are almost no offensive abilities at all in the game. It also holds your hand – more so if you play on ‘easy’. On the lowest difficulty setting, the game becomes an utter cakewalk, which is kind of the point.</p>



<p>It became irritating and immersion-breaking to see how much the game guides you. If you press a button, your objectives are revealed, if you hold another, the creatures hunting you are illuminated, if you can interact with something, it’s highlighted and painted yellow, if something can be knocked over to make a noise, it’s painted red.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that in the interest of time, I didn’t play the game on a harder difficulty, so perhaps you can give it a try and let me know how it goes.</p>



<h2 id="h-hardly-innovative">Hardly Innovative</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Those darn painted surfaces take away any sense of freedom.</figcaption></figure>







<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead allows players to make use of a microphone monitoring mechanic. If they make a noise in real life, they’ll be detected by the creatures in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, that meant I was free to re-enact the scene from the first A Quiet Place movie where John Krasinski’s character sacrifices himself. Spoiler Alert: I died hard. </p>



<p>It also means that a single cough or a belch is enough to bring a world of pain down upon you. I quickly became tired of the feature, even if the thresholds can be tweaked so it’s not so sensitive. I remember a similar feature being present in 2013’s Dead Rising 3, which allowed you to shout into a microphone to gain the attention of zombies.</p>



<p>I have a two-year-old son, there’s no way on Earth I’m going to get far with my microphone being monitored.</p>



<p>Aside from a few puzzles and tough-to-navigate areas, The Road Ahead isn’t too taxing a game. It looks great on the surface and the sound cues (however repetitive) and ambient, environmental soundtrack are good enough, plus the voice acting is stellar, but I feel like it could have been much better done as a whole.</p>



<p>I honestly feel like it would be superb as a VR title, and it would have delivered much better on the horror aspect of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-wait">Verdict: Wait</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of A Quiet Place, you’ll like the world-building and the universe you’re exploring – even if your adventure doesn’t go too far off a defined trail. The creatures are well-designed and authentic, and the intensity is certainly there until you get settled, but the story isn’t meaty enough to truly immerse a player.</p>



<p>Once you’ve locked down the game’s core mechanics, it becomes all too easy to survive. Most of the time, you’ll be crab-walking around a closed area trying to avoid a creature that will kill you with a single hit if you rustle a bush or step on an empty can. </p>



<p>Ultimately, I don’t think A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is worth the $29.99 price tag, and it might be a better idea to wait for a sale, particularly if you’re not interested in the franchise.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-premium-lite-testing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube-is-testing-new-%E2%80%98premium-lite%E2%80%99-a-cheaper-subscription-that-still-shows-ads.1014102/</guid>

<p>Just over a year ago, YouTube shut down Premium Lite, a subscription plan that was available in a handful of countries. It offered the same benefits as YouTube Premium but it was cheaper. It wasn’t long before YouTube shut down the subscription tier, focusing entirely on the core YouTube Premium service.</p>



<p>Now, it has been revealed that the tech titan is preparing to test Premium Lite in all-new markets. This time around, the more affordable subscription will show limited ads, prompting many users to question the point of paying.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-premium-lite-now-with-ads">Premium Lite, Now With Ads</h2>



<p>In a write-up <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-lite-return-3491130/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Android Authority</a>, it was confirmed that Google is testing Premium Lite in Australia, Germany, and Thailand. It’s a change from the all-European market that the service was previously tested in, and it should promise more diversity during the trial.</p>



<p>On Reddit, a user shared a comparison image that outlined the difference between Premium Lite and Premium.</p>



<p>If you’re a core Premium subscriber at $22.99 AUSD per month, you’ll be able to download and play videos offline and in the background, and you’ll have access to YouTube Music Premium. If you’re a Lite subscriber at just $11.99 AUSD a month, you’ll get limited ads and no other visible benefits. </p>



<p>Google highlighted that ads in Premium Lite ‘may appear’ on licensed music content, Shorts, and when you search on the platform.</p>



<p>From a consumer standpoint,  it’s tough to see why anyone would subscribe to Premium Lite <strong>other than </strong>for the reason that it eradicates most ads. Aside from that, you get no added benefits for that monthly investment.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98no-plans-for-additional-story-content%E2%80%99-for-spider-man-2-insomniac-confirms.1014099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a blog post outlining the arrival of Spider-Man 2 on PC, it was confirmed by Insomniac Games that the title will get <strong>no additional story content. </strong>The release of Spider-Man 2 on PC, which is happening on January 30, will bring an all-new audience of players to the game and they’ll soak up everything added thus far, but there are no plans to add any more story content.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shut-down">Shut Down</h2>



<p>It has been a year since Spider-Man 2 was released, and for most of that time, fans of the web-slinging, open-world game have been asking Insomniac when the DLC is coming.</p>



<p>That question was definitively answered recently by the developer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, we’re delighted to bring all of our previously released&nbsp;post-launch content to the PC version, including New Game+, new suits and color variants, Photo Mode features, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It then goes on to explain that this isn’t the end of the road for Spider-Man 2, as costume collaborations are on the way.</p>



<p>The first Marvel Spider-Man title was released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, and that game received an expansion not long after launch, dubbed ‘The City That Never Sleeps’. Eventually, Insomniac published a spin-off – Spider-Man: Miles Morales. There are no indications that any content like this will be made available for Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>Recently, it was suggested that Insomniac is now leaning more heavily into the development of Wolverine and that reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/">a new teaser or trailer</a> will be revealed before the year is out.</p>

You take a game all about building with blocks and you transfer it over to a toy brand that is all about building with bricks and you have a winning combination. While there are a lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">great LEGO Minecraft sets</a> available, some of them are actually about to be retired.</p><p>One of these sets that the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/last-chance-to-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGO website has as "Retiring soon"</a> is the Minecraft Pumpkin Farm that happens to still be on sale at Amazon this October. This set is an excellent option for Halloween, seeing as it's literally a pumpkin house in a swamp with a witch minifigure. Although we don't know exactly when this set will be retired, it almost certainly won't be around at all this time next year. </p><h2>LEGO Minecraft: The Pumpkin Farm on Amazon</h2><div catalogid="3b6051f6-a7cf-45ed-ad86-250d966f7594" id="209462"><div id="209462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Pumpkin Farm</h3></p></div><p>Although this is a fairly small set that is for ages 8 and up, there are a lot of small details that make it worthwhile. The pumpkin house is certainly the main attraction, but there is also a witch, a frog, a potion, and a carved pumpkin. You also get a minifigure of Steve, who is seemingly trying to escape with a treasure chest farther into the swamp. At only 257 pieces, this is a fairly easy build that can be done quickly and doubles as great Halloween decoration.</p><p>The discount itself isn't all that impressive, with the price <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BSRFFXZB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping lower than it currently is now just last week</a>. However, the fact that it is still on sale this close to Halloween makes it worth pointing out. Coupled with the fact that it's set to retire soon, that makes it a great time to pick this set up before it's potentially gone forever.</p><h3>Are Any Other Halloween LEGO Sets on Sale?</h3><p>Now that we are more than halfway through October, now isn't necessarily the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-lego-sets">best time to find LEGO discounts</a> on Halloween-themed sets. Many of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-halloween-lego-sets">favorite Halloween LEGO sets</a> aren't on sale right now. That being said, there are a couple of price reductions worth mentioning that we've gathered below.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 18, 2024 10:50 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Take Mega Man X Dive, for example, which started a smartphone game before jumping to Steam in 2023. While you might expect a mobile spinoff to cut corners, its art direction is just as strong as any other game starring the Blue Bomber, and its nature as a cross-over title means it's packed with awesome-looking characters and remixed designs from across the entire franchise. If you'd like to see the hard work of the illustrators and designers who helped bring it to life, you can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1772943800?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works</a> book for $50 ahead of its release on March 25, 2025.</p><h2>Mega Man X Dive: Official Complete Works</h2><p><strong>$50</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378219"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378219-mega-man-x-dive.jpg"></figure><p>This is a 256-page hardcover book that contains character designs, rough concepts, key art, and plenty of creator commentary. There's even a series of interviews with the developers, so you can find out how characters X, Zero, and Axl were designed for the leap to mobile, alongside newcomers like RiCO, iCO, and ViA. The English cover hasn't been released, but since Udon is publishing this, it's highly likely that it'll be the same as the Japanese edition.</p><hr><p>Curiously, Mega Man artbooks like this fetch a very high price on Amazon--the hardcover <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Official-Complete-Works/dp/1772940747?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man: Complete Works</a> is an eye-watering $200 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Zero-Official-Complete/dp/177294100X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works</a> is $140--presumably due to low print runs and limited stock, so it's smart to lock in a preorder of the X Dive Complete Works if you're a Mega Man fan. As a reminder, you won't be charged until the book ships.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for more Mega Man reading material, there are some other great books to check out. You can watch the Capcom hero confront the horrors of adulthood in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1772943789?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Mega Man</a> manga series, and there are quite a few other manga series as well with a more classical story direction--like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mega-Man-Mastermix-Robot-Rebellion/dp/1772940941?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man Mastermix: Robot Rebellion</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Mega Man: Gigamix</a>--that hews closer to the NES and SNES games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-asmongold-twitch-youtube-rehabilitation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, the internet got a front-row seat to one person’s (too) long-in-coming epiphany about how much of an asshole they’ve been. Following some truly heinous comments about Palestiniains, Asmongold demonstrated what appeared to be authentic contrition, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is it too little, too late</a>? And how does a popular content creator end up here in the first place? What about this line of work leads to so many outrageously bad, sometimes harmful takes? On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by a <em>very </em>special guest, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Aftermath Discord’s</a> own head moderator <a href="https://x.com/appleciderwitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nico “Apple Cider” Deyo</a> (who is also a longtime freelance games journalist), to discuss the trials and tribulations of Asmongold. Then we move on to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird zombie version of Waypoint</a>, a beloved video game site, that Vice recently dredged up. It’s bad! Lastly, we learn about <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new thing</a> Riley hates (Photo modes? For some reason?).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can keep being journalists – rather than full-time content creators – and maintain our sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that someone who is better at doing this – though he also has his share of L takes – is [Charlie “Moistcr1tikal” White]. He loves to position himself similarly, where he’s like “I’m going to come into this bigger conversation and be the performatively rational one.”</p><p><strong>Nico: </strong>It’s hard for me because a lot of these content creators we’re talking about tend to be white dudes, and they can kind of get away with that because they’re given a level of expertise and authority when they are literally just normal guys you could bump into at the bus station or a deli, but they have a camera in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s one of the things with this whole streamer relationship or the YouTuber relationship that makes me feel crazy sometimes. There is nothing that has made Asmongold or Moistcr1tikal a better thinker or a more aware person. They just have a platform and they just have a camera. It’s so frustrating, because I’m like, you’re coming into this conversation because it’s engagement and not because you actually care about this in your real life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In part because no single person could authentically care about the number of things that you need to care about to be a react streamer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nico:</strong> Exactly! Talking for hours on a livestream is a very hard ask. I truly understand that. But it’s also one of the things about that particular platform that breeds that [idea] of “I need to constantly be on. I need to constantly be talking about things – and not thinking about things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, people come to you for the reaction. We were discussing the idea of authenticity earlier, and that’s one of the things that I think people tend to correlate with this notion of authenticity: They’re seeing you react for the first time. But that also means that there’s not a ton of room for preparation, and when you’re discussing important topics or news or what have you, it’s good to prep! You should prep! You might mess something up otherwise, or propagate misinformation, or not handle things with the seriousness they deserve – as I think Asmongold did earlier this week. In addition to saying something awful, he was also flippant about it.&nbsp;</p><p>To his credit, in his apology video, I think he really realized that he fucked up in that regard. I do think in this case he probably means it. I’m not sure he’s squared the ideas in his mind of this kind of thing doing harm alongside his anti-DEI videos. I think he thinks these things are separate. But there are moments in his video where he really does seem emotional about it, and as Riley was saying earlier, we need to give people a chance, at least, to say they’re sorry and do better. Because otherwise we’re just living in a punitive society where all we do is say “Nope, you are beyond repair and should be banished eternally.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I guess the question to me a lot is: What are the consequences? I think Nico’s point that there’s him as a guy and him as a streamer, and if you are irresponsibly wielding your platform to say bad things that hurt people, you should lose that platform. That’s a reasonable consequence. But you should still have friends in your real life.</p><p><strong>Nico: </strong>You should still have friends, absolutely. I think he needs more friends – better real friends in his life that can pull him back. Because we’ve seen flame outs like this at a much smaller level, at a much more personal level, and had to tell people “Hey, you are doing some really awful stuff right now to either yourself or the people around you. Let’s put down the phone.” He deserves that.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you constantly use your platform and your position to hurt others, if you really care about rehabilitation or restorative justice or anything in that vein, you have to be pulled back and cut off from the things that are instruments of material harm. And I think a lot of these people get into content creation because it’s fun, and then it becomes a job, and then the job becomes a lifestyle, and the lifestyle then becomes X, Y, and Z. And I think if you’re going to make a very serious commitment to your mental health and your life – your actual, real life – you have a real responsibility to yourself to pull yourself from the situation that is aiding and abetting you in doing this. Putting away the things you are using to hurt other people.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to talk around, but I think some of these guys have gotten in so deep with the way content creation works; I think a lot of content creation grips people that do have mental health issues – who are workaholics, who are supplementing income in that way, and it just kind of snowballs. But it’s also platforms gamifying workaholism with metrics, and that’s very easy to loop yourself into. It’s very easy to get into that workaholic mindset because there are financial incentives. It’s one thing to walk away from smoking or drinking or whatever, but this a job – a job with no rules and very few guardrails and potentially tons of money and potentially adoration. That is a very hard thing to walk away from or remember feeling bad about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Have we ever seen anyone turn it around? I think I’ve seen that in my own communities in terms of reconciliation processes, which is a value I hold, but the practice is often not as successful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Turned it around in this night and day way? Not anyone I can think of. But there are a lot of content creators who have gradually moved in a better direction over time in terms of their viewpoints and their understanding of their own responsibilities. A lot of this comes with just, like, these people start young. And even though they don’t necessarily get the life experience a lot of us get out in the real world, they still do grow up, have more experiences, meet more people, mellow out a little bit, and recognize that some of the things they did when they were younger or some of the values they held were not super great.&nbsp;</p><p>Another member of OTK, Nick [Polom], hangs out with Hasan [Piker] a lot now and seems to have much better politics than he used to. He used to be kind of an edgelord. I think these people grow on their own terms, maybe sometimes in less pronounced ways. They don’t necessarily grow in these big spurts. But they do change. It’s just that in a lot of cases they’re incentivized not to, so when they do, it’s kind of the exception that proves the rule.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, that’s kind of true of all of us. I make this joke a lot, but I’m really glad that when I was young – and especially when I was first coming out as trans – we didn’t really have the internet. Sometimes I’m like “Phew, everything I thought is lost to the ages.” I do feel a lot of compassion for what it means to have this public platform so young. Everybody grows and changes. It’s not like everybody has a secret edgelord past, but we grow and our politics grow, and hopefully we become better people in whatever spirit that is. It’s gotta be so hard, if you’re being rewarded for [refusing to change] as a young person. How do you pivot? What does it mean? Do you get calcified?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, at New York Comic Con on the Marvel stage, Insomniac Games announced that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is coming to PC on January 30, 2025. The porting is being done by Nixxes Software, which also worked on the previous installments. Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes, stated:</p>
<p><em>Bringing Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes. We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel's Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch!</em></p>
<p>Eric Monacelli, Executive Producer for Marvel Games, said:</p>
<p><em>Showcasing our characters to as many fans as possible, in the coolest ways possible, are some of the reasons they are so beloved. In that spirit, we’re excited that our Spider Heroes, their friends, and their Super Villains are coming to PC in the critically acclaimed Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Collaborating with Insomniac Games and PlayStation produced a timeless Super Hero video game classic that, thanks to Nixxes and the support of all teams involved, players can now experience on PC with thrilling enhanced features.</em></p>
<p>Mike Fitzgerald, Core Technology Director at Insomniac, added:</p>
<p><em>Our amazing partners at Nixxes have once again done an incredible job bringing the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man to PC players. Our team put a lot of love into this game, and we’re excited that it will soon be enjoyed by a whole new audience with keyboard and mouse controls, ultra widescreen support, and numerous graphical options that make it feel at home on their platform.</em></p>
<p>The developers didn't actually announce the PC features of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 yet, but we can likely expect the usual bevy of features seen in Miles Morales: NVIDIA DLSS (and Frame Generation), AMD FSR (and Frame Generation), Intel XeSS, and improved ray tracing effects compared to the PlayStation 5 version.</p>

<p>By the way, if you were still hoping the game would get some sort of story DLC akin to The City That Never Sleeps, that's not happening. The official blog post says there is no story content coming to Marvel's Spider-Man 2; however, the PC version will already launch with New Game+, new suits and color variants, and the Photo Mode features that were added through updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-apparently-had-framerate-troubles-because-the-npcs-were-thinking-too-hard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I've just had a thought..."</h2></div><section><p>A new patch for Dragon's Dogma 2 dropped earlier this week, adding options within the game's settings to prioritize either graphics or performance. The latter should help improve the game's oft-lamented framerate issues, which developer Capcom is now saying were a direct result of Dragon's Dogma 2's many NPCs...thinking too much.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/20868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu interview</a> (via Google Translate, which IGN independently verified), the development team was asked about one of the purported improvements in the update, specifically to "excessive load on the CPU." In response, the team said that CPU power in Dragon's Dogma 2 is allocated to process the "thoughts" of each NPC and how they interact with physics calculations.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A new update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is available now on all platforms!</p><p>- Changed the options in "Graphics" within the Options menu to "Prioritize Graphics" and "Prioritize Performance."</p><p>For additional resolution and performance info on each option, please reference the chart… <a href="https://t.co/qwztLSSd5i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qwztLSSd5i</a></p></div>— Dragon's Dogma (@DragonsDogma) <a href="https://twitter.com/DragonsDogma/status/1846729433958568380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"Therefore, in sequences where many NPCs appear at the same time, such as in towns, the load on the CPU was very high, which affected the frame rate. Because the CPU was the bottleneck, reducing the load on the GPU side, such as lowering the resolution, had little effect on improving the frame rate."</p><p>In response, Capcom has been "reviewing the processing of NPC thoughts and making fine adjustments such as the execution order of each process in updates since the release." As a result, Dragon's Dogma 2 now has graphics quality settings that allow it to be played at "approximately 50 to 60fps" on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Steam has a similar setting to reduce processing load.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Frustrating as the framerate issues may have been for players, Dragon's Dogma 2's NPC complexity is a pretty vital part of the series. All the NPCs have regular schedules, activities, and even relationships with other NPCs they have to maintain. The Pawns are especially complex, even if their dialogue makes them seem like total dinguses. They constantly adjust to player behavior and even learn new tactics during combat, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-mod-lets-players-silence-incessant-pawn-chatter">give noisy advice</a>, lead players to treasure, and uh, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-players-are-freaking-out-over-a-mysterious-plague-that-turns-pawns-murderous">murder them</a>! It's no wonder that with how busy every single character in the world is at any given moment, things got a little hectic in some of the game's more crowded areas.</p><p>We gave Dragon's Dogma 2 an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review">8/10 in our review</a> earlier this year, calling it "a strange and wonderful action-RPG that bolsters the original’s strengths without addressing its weaknesses."</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/i-tried-to-get-into-mechwarrior-5-clans-as-a-newcomer-but-its-for-the-fans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mechwarrior-5-clans-is-supposed-to-be-newbie-friendly-and-i-put-it-to-the-test.1013988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/i-tried-to-get-into-mechwarrior-5-clans-as-a-newcomer-but-its-for-the-fans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Again, there's a whole lot of context to the plot dynamics I'm missing, not having any <em>BattleTech&nbsp;</em>background. Voices were regularly astounded to see some form of enemy or witness some explosion, while I was focused on marching forward and learning the controls.</p>


<h2>Do you like menus?</h2>
<p>I have no real issue with the core loop of&nbsp;<em>Clans</em>. You've got five bio-engineered clan members, each with distinct skills. Each member pilots a BattleMech (just "mech" from here on out) that can be customized. One of your pilots might have an affinity for melee fighting, and you can cultivate that or move them down a different skill tree branch to become a lighter recon type. You, Jayden, are pretty decent at everything, so you have the blessing and curse of limitless customization.</p>
<p>Customization is where&nbsp;<em>MechWarrior</em> heads are getting much more out of this game than I am. You eventually get to pick out a mech chassis (out of 16 available), then customize each of its "pods": left/right leg, left/right arm, left/center/right torso, and head. You make interesting choices around weight, energy, speed, armor, and firepower. You get more options as you play on, spending resources on research and achieving optional goals. And you'll see most of the things you can potentially strap onto your mech on other mechs you encounter.</p>
<p>With five mechs to customize and only so much experience duking it out with other mechs in the field, the "'Mech Lab" portion of <em>Clans</em> felt overwhelming to a newcomer. There is tutorial pointing and a gradual expansion of options, but it still felt like an impediment to the stomping, shooting, and squad tactics. Which, perhaps unsurprisingly, was also a bit overwhelming for a newcomer.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>Someone yelling at you, an objective in the distance, and a bunch of blips on radar: Welcome to the front, pilot.</span>

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>


<h2>Do you like buttons?</h2>
<p>I played the combat portions of <em>Clans</em> with a controller, and it was fine. I played it with a mouse and keyboard, and it was better. Eventually, I mapped a whole bunch of squad commands to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/figmas-creator-micro-made-me-a-macro-pad-person-with-its-colorful-clicky-keys/">my little macro pad</a> and, while not quite a full throttle and joystick, it made me feel much more involved in the combat.</p>

            <p>
With the first anniversary of Spider-Man 2's PS5 release just days away, developer Insomniac has announced the acclaimed superhero sequel will launch for PC on 30th January next year.
</p>
<p>
Insomniac isn't quite ready to talk platform-specific enhancements just yet, but it <em>has</em> confirmed Spider-Man 2's PC port will include the acclaimed base game and all the extra content released through the game's various free post-launch updates. And if you haven't been keeping track, that means PC purchasers will get access to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>14 new suits</li>
<li>New Game+</li>
<li>Ultimate Levels</li>
<li>New Symbiote Suit Styles</li>
<li>Time of Day options</li>
<li>Post-Game Achievements</li>
<li>Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode</li>
<li>Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> (which this time follows the web-flicking adventures of dual protagonists Peter Parker and Miles Morales) comes to PC in two different versions. There's the standard edition, which includes all the above, plus a pricier Digital Deluxe Edition.
</p><p>
The latter features everything in the standard edition, plus ten exclusive suits - five for Peter and five for Miles - plus early unlocks for Peter's Arachknight suit, Miles' Shadow-Spider suit, and the Web Grabber gadget. The Deluxe Edition also grants +5 skill points and some additional photo mode items. But if that doesn't appeal, it's worth noting anyone that pre-orders the base game <em>also</em> gets the Arachknight suit, Shadow-Spider suit, Web Grabber, and +3 skill points.
</p>
<p>
Sony hasn't announced a price for either version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC just yet, but they'll be available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">Epic Games Store</a> come 30th January next year.
</p>
<p>
And Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is definitely worth your time. "The vibes here are ultimately just good," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review</a> of the game last year, "and simple side activities where you find basic collectibles and lob bin lids at disturbers of the peace are exactly the right accompaniment."

Originally launched on PS5 in October 2023, <em>Marvel’s</em>&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em> will be available to play on Steam starting January 30, 2025.

Wizards of the Coast will release five Secret Lair drops, each themed around an individual character, starting November 4, 2024. </p><p>Each Secret Lair Drop will feature an original Legendary creature based on one of five Marvel characters: Black Panther, Storm, Iron Man, Wolverine, and Captain America. Each of these creatures' abilities are themed around the character. For instance, Iron Man will both create Treasure tokens, then let you sacrifice an artifact to tutor up any artifact, based on the sacrificed card's mana value – an extremely powerful effect. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Magic: The Gathering - Marvel Collaboration Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>The Secret Lair Drops will also include four reprints themed around the starring character. The price is $39.99 for non-foil cards and $49.99 for foil cards.

Because it’s not enough to just win your next Commander battle, you have to win the right way. This drop features card art by Anthony Devine, Howard Lyon, Ryan Pancoast, Livia Prima, and Chris Rahn.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Secret Lair x Marvel’s Iron Man</strong></p><blockquote><em>Billionaire, genius, Super Hero, and now Secret Lair Drop—Tony Stark really has done it all. High-tech, low-drag, all power—this drop features sleek art and five cutting-edge cards, including an all-new legendary Iron Man card, that will put you into the armor of one of the Avengers’ most inventive Super Heroes. This drop features card art by Bud Cook, Justyna Dura, Lie Setiawan, Anna Steinbauer, Marco Teixeira.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Secret Lair x Marvel’s Wolverine</strong></p><blockquote><em>All right, bub… it’s time to brawl. This deadly drop combines mutant healing factor with killer instincts to bring you five ferocious cards inspired by the X-Men’s most relentless member, including an all-new, legendary Wolverine card. Grab this drop and the bones of your next Commander deck will be made of adamantium. Ain’t no stinkin’ way you’ll lose. This drop features card art by Victor Adame Minguez, Alexander Mokhov, Anna Podedworna, Eliz Roxs.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Secret Lair x Marvel’s Storm</strong></p><blockquote><em>Shutter the windows and head down to the cellar, Storm is coming. This gale-force drop features stunning artwork of Marvel’s Storm across five fierce cards, including the all-new legendary Storm card. Summon the fury of the elements and turn the X-Men’s most electric leader into your next commander. This drop features card art by Miguel Mercado, Francisco Miyara, Kevin Sidharta, Magali Villeneuve, Pauline Voss.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Secret Lair x Marvel’s Black Panther</strong></p><blockquote><em>Leaping from the heart of Wakanda into the depths of Secret Lair, Black Panther is on the prowl. Featuring the alter ego of warrior king T’Challa, this drop brings the power of Vibranium to bear across five majestic cards, including an all-new legendary Black Panther. Protect your people, punish your enemies, and preserve your position as commander and king. This drop features card art by Tyler Jacobson, Jake Murray, Ernanda Souza, Swayart, and Salvatorre Zee Yazzie.</em></blockquote><blockquote data-theme="light">— Magic: The Gathering (@wizards_magic) <a href="https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1716484834241999104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, Wizards of the Coast announced a Tentpole Booster set based on Spider-Man. Wizards of the Coast hasn't revealed any of the cards, and isn't discussing format legality, but compares it to the Lord of the Rings set that launched in June 2023. That set was the first Universes Beyond set to be legal in the competitive Modern format, but it remains to be seen if Marvel's Spider-Man will follow suit. </p><p>The full Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering set will launch sometime in 2025. It remains to be seen whether or not it will be accompanied by prebuilt Commander decks. </p><p><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

                <p dir="ltr">Bloober Team has read the nasty tweets and it's seen the videos in which skeptics brace for disappointment; it hasn't ignored the pessimism. The Polish, horror-obsessed studio even admits it's made "shitty" games in the past. Now, it's out to prove Silent Hill 2 Remake wasn't a one-hit wonder built from a trustworthy, pre-existing blueprint. Speaking with Bloober Team less than 24 hours after its newest horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-647672">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, was revealed during the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-5861/">Xbox Partner Preview</a>, and just two weeks after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2 Remake parade of praise</a> kicked off, I learned the studio's next project is intended to reinforce a newly emerging narrative: the Bloober Team redemption arc.</p><p dir="ltr">"We don't want to make a similar game [to Silent Hill 2]," director/designer Wojciech Piejko told me during an interview focused on the team's first post-Silent Hill project, which began to take shape a few months after The Medium was released in 2021. Though Cronos: The New Dawn and Silent Hill 2 Remake were being developed on overlapping timelines, they come from largely different teams within the studio and are meant to feel like "different pizzas with different toppings--both delicious," he said with a laugh. Silent Hill 2 Remake was better than most seemed to expect, but Cronos: The New Dawn seeks to prove they can build something special from scratch, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The game centers on The Traveler, a mysterious person who moves through timelines. On one end is a future ravaged by a pandemic and inhabited by monstrous mutants. On the other end is communist Poland circa the 1980s. The Traveler is tasked with moving backward through time to rescue VIPs who didn't survive, disrupting the timeline to bring them into the future where they may be able to help. If it sounds like things will get wonky in that classic time-travel way, I'd bet you're right. The duo told me the game is inspired by Netflix's Dark, a magnificent series that often felt like an oddly welcome headache for those trying to make sense of its elaborate plot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387165-cronos-tram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387165-cronos-tram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387165"></a><figcaption>Bloober Team's next game is purposely hard to compare to Silent Hill 2 in setting and story. The team wants it to stand on its own.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387165-cronos-tram.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite being built during the COVID era and involving a pandemic of its own, Cronos is not intended to be Bloober Team's "big comment about COVID or something," director/producer Jacek Zieba told me. "We were afraid of [the pandemic plot point] at the very beginning," Piejko added, because it had felt like the worst of the pandemic era was behind them and they didn't want to return to that headspace. They ended up keeping it in when it became clear to them that the story worked too well to discard it.</p><p dir="ltr">With Cronos being the team's first original survival-horror IP, following years of horror games such as Layers of Fear and Observer, which were light on gamplay elements, the team feels like it's ready for its next phase of evolution. Naturally, this is owed in part to its take on Silent Hill 2. "It helped in the case of technology," Zieba said, "to jump from first-person to the third-person camera [with] ranged combat and other stuff. So the basis [for Cronos] when we started in pre-production was there [thanks to] the Silent Hill team."</p><p dir="ltr">From there, though, the team sought to go in a starkly different direction, partly to avoid any finer comparisons between its remake project and its original IP. It landed on a sci-fi horror that moves through time and space, but the pair of games do remain linked in one other vital way: Bloober Team hopes Cronos can be the "second punch" of a two-hit combo for the team, said Zieba, likening the studio to a victorious underdog. "Nobody believed we could deliver, and we delivered. That was a big honor, that we, as Bloober, could work with Silent Hill and Konami. As horror creators, we love Silent Hill, like, I think, most horror fans [do.]"</p><p dir="ltr">Still, the entire staff was keenly aware of the tenor of the internet's criticism surrounding the Silent Hill 2 remake and the studio as a whole. When the team was revealed as the developer of Konami's major revival project, much of the online reaction was pessimistic or skeptical. People felt Bloober Team wasn't cut out for the job, not having made true <em>survival</em>-horror games before, and thus never having shown it could build out deeper mechanics like inventory management and combat. Eventually, the company put out a statement aimed at the general public in which it <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1728881203401687235" rel="nofollow ">asked for patience</a> as it worked on Silent Hill 2, all while the people inside the company were unable or unwilling to block out the noise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387166-cronos-caterpillarbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387166" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387166-cronos-caterpillarbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387166"></a><figcaption>Hints of Poland's communist-era brutalist architecture can be seen in this shot, which presumably is set in the game's future timeline.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387166-cronos-caterpillarbase.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It was tough for those couple of years before [Silent Hill 2's] release," he said, but added that the remake team was tough, too, for not letting it get under their skin. "They made it. We made it. Bloober made it. And now, it's very good spirits inside [the studio.] We want to show what we can do on our own, how we can evolve our ideas."</p><p dir="ltr">"They recreated a legendary game," Piejko said of his colleagues on the remake team. "They made the impossible <em>possible</em>, and it was a bumpy road because of all the hate on the internet. The pressure was big on them, and they delivered, and for the company, it's an amazing moment."</p><p dir="ltr">The team <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-says-its-done-making-walking-sim-horror-games/1100-6515580/">previously stated</a> it considers 2016's Layers of Fear the studio's rebirth, when it pivoted from aimlessly making immensely panned games like Basement Crawl to instead focusing on horror games, even if they weren't yet the kind of horror games some players, and even some developers, were satisfied with. Layers of Fear put Bloober Team on the map, but people inside the studio understood that wasn't its final form. Silent Hill 2 Remake is seen as the start of "Bloober Team 3.0," as the best-reviewed game in the company's history. Now, the team is hoping Cronos can demonstrate a more homegrown shift into a proud new era for the studio, backed by the optimistic reception to the unveiling of Cronos: The New Dawn.</p><p dir="ltr">When Cronos was revealed, "we all felt relief," Piejko revealed. "All the comments were like, 'Yeah, this looks great. I love the design of the character.'" To him and others, it was uplifting to see how the perception of the studio is already noticeably changing. Despite all the pressure of Silent Hill 2 Remake, there's arguably still plenty bearing down on the team as it seeks to prove it can conjure magic entirely of its own, but the directors told me this genre is where they want to be, and they're willing to prove they have what it takes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387167-cronos-pods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387167" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387167-cronos-pods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387167"></a><figcaption>As fans of Netflix's Dark, Bloober Team told me a good sci-fi story should feel earned; a little homework for the audience is a good thing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387167-cronos-pods.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We want to be a horror company," Zieba told me. "We want to find our niche, and we think we found our niche, so now we just--let's evolve with it. [...] And how that happens is more complex, but it also happens organically in a way, like with [2016's] Layers of Fear, people in the studio were like, 'Okay, we made some shitty games before, but we [can] evolve."</p><p dir="ltr">"We gathered a team that loves horror," Piejko added. "So I think, for us, it would not be easy to switch [to other genres], and we don't want to."</p><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

As part of this reporting, Belloni shared a story from 2022 involving an interaction between Craig and Sarandos during the TIFF 2022 premiere of <em>Glass Onion,</em> the sequel to <em>Knives Out. </em></p><p>Apparently, after the audience at the event gave the movie a standing ovation, Craig used it as evidence that <em>Glass Onion</em> should get a larger and longer theatrical release. The Netflix CEO disagreed and replied that’s “not our model” and that led to a heated reply from the Benoit Blanc actor, who reportedly said some variation of “Your model is fucked.” And according to Puck, Craig isn’t the only person in Hollywood unhappy with Netflix’s streaming-focused business model. <br></p><p>Last week, Belloni reported that Margot Robbie and filmmaker Emerald Fennell had passed on a $150 million Netflix deal for their upcoming <em>Wuthering Heights</em> movie. Reportedly, Fennell and Robbie want the cultural impact that theaters can provide. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/matt-damon-casey-affleck-possible-the-instigators-sequel-streaming-future-their-chemistry-fenway-park-appletv-1236075992/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/matt-damon-casey-affleck-possible-the-instigators-sequel-streaming-future-their-chemistry-fenway-park-appletv-1236075992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In September, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that <em>Glass Onion </em>could have made over $600 million worldwide at the box office if it had received a full-length theatrical run and marketing push by Netflix. It was also reported that Craig and writer/director Rian Johnson weren’t happy about the situation.

Specifically, the characters and events from the amazing Spider-Man. This tentpole set will be available sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Marvel crossover pre-panel meeting, we asked Senior Product Designer Daniel Nguyen about future potential Universes Beyond crossovers. Nguyen stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying to figure out how much I can say or can’t say, but basically our emerging business team, they are fantastic and always trying to find cool things for us to get into. And typically we try to align them with cultural beats, right? Like the Fallout set - this was serendipitous but the Fallout set came out at the same time the Fallout show came out, and that is the ideal case. When something else is happening and you’re thinking about that thing and then BOOM, here’s some Magic cards related to that thing. Doesn’t always line up, these are big moving things, but that’s generally our motivation: what do people want, when are people going to be thinking about it?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During our one-on-one meeting, Nguyen also stressed that this partnership is focused on the Marvel comics IP, and not the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which Nguyen explained also gave the design team a lot of room to play in, and deep-cuts for comic lovers to explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Marvel crossover is the first major collaboration between Wizards of the Coast and the ubiquitous superhero property. The superhero franchise has dabbled in the tabletop space through the living card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and the <em>Marvel Multiverse</em> TTRPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/weapons-and-armaments-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new blog post by the Call of Duty staff, it's been explained what Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons are going to be coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">launches on October 25, 2024</a>. The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> also goes into detail about how players will be able to create Global Weapon Builds, as well as how the weapons unlock. In total, there will be an arsenal of 33 different armaments that you can utilize to customize your weapon to your liking, including 12 weapons that are all completely new to the franchise.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is said to have a streamlined Weapons menu on launch to help players build and customize their Loadouts, allowing them to have a smoother experience. Additionally, there will be Weapon Leveling to come in the future, meaning that exploring and researching what weapons are available will be crucial for the player so that they can find out how to unlock weapons that may be beneficial to them, as well as the Gunsmith being more accessible than previous games in the franchise.</p>
<p>Diving into the Primary Weapons, there are a wide variety of guns to choose from, as well as individual Attachments for each weapon, which unlock as you level the weapon up. Here are the types of Primary Weapon you can expect at launch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles (7)</li>
<li>SMGs (6)</li>
<li>Shotguns (2)</li>
<li>LMGs (3)</li>
<li>Marksman Rifles (4)</li>
<li>Sniper Rifles (3)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also stated that some of the Optics available for these weapons will be unlocked through different means rather than leveling up. Additionally, you can run the Wildcard "Overkill," which will allow you to equip a second Primary Weapon in the Secondary Weapon slot if you're feeling a little bit chaotic.</p>
<p>For the Secondary Weapons, there aren't as many options. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistols (4)</li>
<li>Launchers (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Melee Weapon, only the Knife or Baseball Bat will be available on launch. Whether there will be more in the future is uncertain, but it seems unlikely. However, there will be many different cosmetics you can use for your weapons at The Gunsmith if you want to add some flair to your kills.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The launch weaponry in Black Ops 6 does have specific unlock criteria, which are related to your Player Progression. If you want to check how well you are doing, you'll be able to see how far along you are via the Progression tab in the Barracks Menu.</p>
<p>There are attachments made for each weapon, with some having special unlock requirements and others being unlocked immediately to give players the opportunity to experiment. Of course, for more details on what you can expect from the weaponry at launch, you can read more about the specifics in the Call of Duty blog post.</p>
