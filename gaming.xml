		<p>The lines between console generations and hardware leaps have become so blurred in the last few years. It almost doesn’t make sense to me that The Last of Us Part II is already five years old, nor does the reminder that it was originally a PlayStation 4 game feel like any more of a truthful statement. A big part of that is a combination of just how incredibly good this game has always looked, combined with the increasingly shrinking amount of space new games have left to innovate or expand on graphical technology. It already felt like we hit the apex with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">the original PS4 release of this game</a>, and seeing just how gorgeous it is on PC makes it even harder to believe it isn’t actually a cutting-edge, brand new game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Announcement Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6MdexNSy3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of my favorite parts of modern PlayStation exclusives is the absolute overload of accessibility options and fine-tuning settings they pack into their releases. The recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">PS5 re-release of The Last of Us II</a> added an impressive number of these to the game, beyond what was already there on PS4, and they’re all included in this PC release as well. A lot of them are gameplay altering options that lessen or remove certain instances in combat, and options to retool a lot of button-holds and presses to taps or triggers. There’s a refreshing amount of UI options, as well, including welcome sizing options for the HUD and subtitles that would make playing the game on a large screen or from a far non-desktop distance a lot easier.</p>

<p>On top of these tools, there’s a massive array of new graphical and display settings available for the PC version of the game. All the frame generation and upscaling methods you’d hope for are included here – with AMD’s FSR 3.1 and 4, Nvidia’s DLSS 3 with Frame Gen, and Intel XeSS support. There’s also solid ultrawide screen support, with the option to even toggle cinematic pillarboxes on or off if you dare.</p>

<p>There’s all the graphical settings you would expect from a native PC release, with things like texture quality, LOD, volumetrics, shadows and more all scalable. I was also happy to see the amount of control The Last of Us II gives you over visual effect intensity on PC. You’ve got sliders for film grain, lens dirt, chromatic aberration, and camera shake, letting those who dislike certain effects tune them down or turn them off. Some of the finer options go a bit over my head, but what’s obvious is that the game looks great and runs great.</p>
<p>Without doing in-depth benchmarks across dozens of GPUs and configurations, my GeForce 3080 handled the game with ease. I get crisp visuals at 1440P and nearly maxed out settings alongside the game hovering around 120FPS in cutscenes and floating between 60-90FPS in gameplay.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Part II is also verified for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> – and while it’s certainly a consistent experience on the hybrid Valve handheld, it’s also without a doubt a highly compromised experience. Visuals take a noticeable hit on this platform, even with heavy FSR upscaling applied. I wouldn’t see myself enjoying the narrative-heavy material of the game in this way.</p>
<p>I did, however, enjoy a couple hours of the roguelike No Return mode on my Steam Deck, since it’s so much more of a combat focused experience where visual fidelity and lighting effects don’t matter nearly as much to me. This mode has been expanded a little for the PC release, with the new content being patched into the PS5 release as well. There’s new characters brought forward from TLOU Part I with Bill and Marlene giving new playstyles, and there’s four new maps to help sprinkle a little more variety into your runs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing compromised about The Last of Us II&nbsp;on PC. Even the previously controversial PSN account requirements touted for Helldivers II and God of War: Ragnarok on PC are fully optional this time around for The Last of Us II. If you want to experience this chapter of Naughty Dog’s harrowing post-apocalyptic epic, you’re in for just as much of a rewarding journey on PC as you would be on PS5.</p>

			<p>Nintendo's presentation for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2 included many surprises</a>, but the brand-new open-world Donkey Kong game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was arguably the biggest surprise of all.</p>
<p>That is why I was very intrigued to check out the gameplay that would be shown during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream event. The event showcased several of the games revealed during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct, including Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p>If you want to say that it's just Donkey Kong getting the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, you'd be only sort of right. Yes, in technical terms, it is a 3D platformer, and yes, you do have a little pal along with you for the journey that's a new character for the series. Donkey Kong appropriately gets a little odd-looking talking rock as his companion, rather than a hat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkNm2wmpyto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what makes this more than just Mario Odyssey swapped out with Donkey Kong is DK's ability to smash everything and anything around him. The game's surrounding terrain is entirely moldable, with the ability to smash new paths on either side of you, above you, and below you. DK might not have the platforming prowess of Mario, but he makes up for it by being able to entirely re-shape the world he inhabits.</p>
<p>The gameplay shown off in the Treehouse livestream shows how you can not only destroy the surrounding terrain, you absolutely should be smashing the world around you to bits as often as you can. It also shows off a few DK-specific movement abilities that still let him retain some of the fluid movement Mario enjoys.</p>
<p>It's still ultimately just a vertical slice of a much larger game, but the Treehouse livestream makes clear that there's more to Donkey Kong Bananza than just being a game where Donkey Kong gets the Super Mario Odyssey treatment.</p>

Nvidia doesn’t mention which version of DLSS will be supported on the Switch 2, nor whether there will be any frame generation capabilities.</p><p>The Nvidia GPU inside the Switch 2 also has “dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores,” according to Nvidia. These RT cores will deliver real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2, with the promise of “lifelike lighting, reflections, and shadows for more immersive worlds. The Tensor Cores will “enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, enhancing social gaming and streaming.”</p><p>Nvidia also says that the console has “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch,” which is a performance claim that’s almost certainly related to the use of DLSS. The Switch 2’s variable refresh rate in handheld mode is also powered by Nvidia G-Sync technology.</p><p>Nintendo, from the outset of working on the Switch 2, wanted to improve its power over the original Switch, according to an “Ask the Developer” interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-1%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor2lw7D2_B_Ig_OsE7Rysc49i1LaqOcmkWF0eQnUf0PFwGrRcBx" rel="sponsored">published yesterday</a>. The company says that its improved performance enables things like letting you destroy “anything you want” in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> “without restrictions” and the seamlessly-connected courses in <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2: Hellfire Gala has been revealed, confirming the arrival of two new characters, Emma Frost and Ultron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala begins on April 11, 2025, and the new trailer provides players with details on what to expect. Emma Frost has invited all Marvel Rivals characters to the island of Krakoa, so mutant rivals and friends can work together to share a better future. However, Ultron has different plans and invades the peaceful time Marvel Rivals characters are having during Emma Frost’s party.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-emma-frost-and-ultron-arrive-for-marvel-rivals-season-2">Emma Frost and Ultron Arrive for Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>The Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyG51IdChc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> begins with characters like Magneto, Wolverine, Star Lord, Black Panther and more pulling up on a red carpet with their flashiest outfits (some new skin teases), clicking pictures, interacting with each other and having a great time. However, as soon as Emma Frost starts delivering a toast, she is interrupted by an invasion from Ultron’s army, and the Marvel Rivals roster has to join hands to take down a common enemy.&nbsp;More details about the upcoming season should be revealed closer to release, including new characters, maps, cosmetics and more.</p>



<p>Emma Frost and Ultron were leaked for Marvel Rivals a few months ago. Emma Frost was expected to arrive with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole set of X-Men characters</a>, including Professor X, Gambit, Nightcrawler, and more. Ultron, on the other hand, was leaked along with the Thing. He is expected to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a support character</a> with different healing abilities for the team.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in April, and this month, there's a rich selection of gangland drama, sci-fi adventues, and fashion crimes to check out. In total, there'll be 23 games on offer this month. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>One of the highlights this month is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition/" data-ref-id="5000-512542">Mafia 3: Definitive Edition</a>. Compared to the previous Mafia games, Mafia 3 offers a busier sandbox to explore while you embark on a tale of revenge. After his surrogate family is wiped out by the Italian Mafia, protagonist Lincoln Clay embarks on a mission to take down the Mafiaso responsible, while building a new family and crime syndicate in the process. The Definitive Edition comes with a lot of post-launch story content and various cosmetics bundled in as well.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-clip-focuses-on-a-date-night-for-unlikely-couple/1100-6530463/" data-ref-id="1100-6530463">Minecraft movie launching this week</a>, you can also check out one of the spin-off games through Prime Gaming. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-566097">Minecraft Legends</a> is an action-strategy game that places a heavier emphasis on story, multiplayer, and tactics. While the combat mechanics can be a little rough, the attention to detail, cute character designs, and environments will likely make it a hit with younger members of the family looking for more Minecraft entertainment.</p><p>Another interesting game to grab this month is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genesis-noir/" data-ref-id="5000-480616">Genesis Noir</a>, which is a beautiful adventure with noir undertones that spans all of time and space. This is essentially a point-and-click puzzle-adventure with incredibly stylish visuals that tells the story of a love triangle between cosmic beings, and the game is a digestible jaunt across the cosmos. For something that won't give you an existential crisis, there's the avant-garde action of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fashion-police-squad/" data-ref-id="5000-513934">Fashion Police Squad</a>. A boomer-shooter where you dispense justice with a leather belt and weaponized sewing machines, it's a weird but enjoyable dive into the fashion industry.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for April 2025</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li>Mafia 3: Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Minecraft Legends (Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code)</li><li>Gravity Circuit (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Paleo Pines (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Clouds &amp; Sheep 2 (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>April 10</h3><ul><li>DreadOut 2 (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Endless Space - Definitive Edition (Amazon Games App)</li><li>God's Trigger (GOG Code)</li><li>New York Mysteries: Power of Art Collector's Edition</li><li>Projection: First Light (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Faraway: Director's Cut (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>April 17</h3><ul><li>Gloomhaven (Epic Games Store)</li><li>The Last Spell (GOG Code)</li><li>Fashion Police Squad (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Genesis Noir (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (GOG Code)</li><li>Berserk Boy (GOG Code)</li><li>The Last Show of Mr. Chardish (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Wild Country (GOG Code)</li></ul><h3>April 24</h3><ul><li>Thief Gold (GOG Code)</li><li>Troublemaker (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Kraken Academy (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in January via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</li><li>Hot Wheels Unleashed</li><li>Bee Simulator</li><li>Thymesia</li><li>The Jackbox Party Pack 6</li><li>Fortnite OG</li><li>Fortnite Ballistic</li><li>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Trackmania Starter Access</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

Just how much does it cost, though? In Japan, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's priced at ¥990</a>. This works out to about $6.50 USD. Regional pricing varies, and Nintendo hasn't yet announced a price point for the US. GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to find out.</p><p>"Through tech demos, minigames, and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise," Nintendo said of Welcome Tour.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="553709640" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amplitude-announce-endless-legend-2-an-oceanic-4x-with-manor-lords-outfit-hooded-horse-as-publisher">decidedly oceanic</a>, with seas that shift and retreat to reveal new areas over the course of a campaign, so it makes sense that at least one of the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game's new factions should be aquatic-themed. Say hello to the Aspects, and say hello to their coral. You'll be able to say hello to their coral because it is, in fact, a hivemind - a biomechanical reef that provides access to a gestalt intelligence called the Chorus, and which extends across their territory much like the Creep of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>'s Zerg, but in a less obviously menacing way.

<p>
"In terms of gameplay, the Aspects are an economic and diplomatic empire focused on cooperation over conquest," explains a press release from developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a> and publishers Hooded Horse. "Their main unique trait is their coral terrain - instead of claiming territories via outposts, the Aspects first place Coral Spores that will slowly spread coral to other tiles. These can be turned into cities, but they also serve as nodes for coral growth across the map." 
</p>
<p>
Yes. Yes. This is very much my cup of picturesque-but-insidious. Coral spores also extract dust, the game's magic resource, from their surroundings, while healing and accelerating your units and letting them cross water tiles. Best of all, they infest the minds of your rivals, making them better-disposed towards you. One way this happens is that other empires can exploit any coral growing on their territory for dust, which in turn lets the Aspect player see what they're seeing, and makes it easier to sway those empires in diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude have written a big <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/965">forum post</a> explaining their inspirations for the faction's visual design (coral aside, their architecture calls on influences from central Asia) and playstyle. "For them, we wanted to move away from the classical trope of diplomatic pacifist faction and make them something more like 'deal with the devil'," the designers write. "They don't want this world to be safer but manipulate people for their own good.
</p>
<p>
"At first, we wanted to make them evil landlords, capturing territories then selling them to other empires," the post continues. "This idea evolved into the Coral growing toward other empires' assets and giving to the Aspect the possibility to sign some specific treaties and get additional resources.
</p>
<p>
"The main difficulty dealing with the development of this faction was the fact that the Coral is a common resource shared by all Aspect empires in the game. This creates drastic changes in how you will play this faction whether there is another Aspect empire in your game or not." Intriguing.
</p>
<p>
As for the Aspect at war, they're big on cooperation with a varied roster of "swarming scouts", "steadfast archers" and "powerful flying behemoths". One key overarching mechanic is that when an Aspect unit defends for a turn, it confers attack boosts on allies. So they are great counterpunchers, in short. If only real-life coral reefs were this resilient.
</p>
<p>
I really like this crafty and unpleasant approach to the idea of a diplomacy faction. It's certainly channelling the spirit of the first game's faction design, which (for example) cast dragons against type by sort of turning them into the UN.
</p>
<p>
But where is my faction of no-nonsense warmongering builder-bastards, I hear you cry? That would probably be <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/964-kin-of-sheredyn-spotlight">the Kin of Sheredyn</a>, a band of cyberpunk Romans who are the remnants of a fallen interstellar empire. They're great at shield walls, hench automatons, and staying under their city cap because they think it's uncouth to expand too much. I haven't dug into the detail yet, but they feel like Endless Legend 2's equivalent for the first game's Vaulters.
</p>
<p>There will be two other factions ready to go for Endless Legend 2's early access launch this year, with two more planned for the 1.0 version. Any hopes for the remaining empires? I always liked the first game's Wandering Tribes, who found their cities on massive beetles. Perhaps the new game will harbour an equivalent who live inside whales.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Have you ever woken up and thought to yourself "I'd like to be a bear, or perhaps a moose, just for like, a little bit"? Oddly specific thing to think about first thing in the morning, but <strong>Striden</strong> has you covered at least. It's a looter shooter, yes, it's a survival game, sure, it's a team-based game, why not! Except sometimes, for some reason, you can just turn into different animals to fight your opponents, like a radioactive bear, which I think is very silly, but in a wonderful kind of way. And, as developer 5 Fortress announced today, it's getting an open beta this weekend so you can see what it's like for yourself.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a couple of new modes being introduced with the beta, the first being transmit mode. This one is PvP, and sees you duking it out with other players across "three intense maps in a fast-paced objective mode." Presumably this one involves moving something around, given the name. There's also a PvE mode which sees you trying to hold out against "relentless waves of enemies." More bears? No idea! I hope not, I don't like the idea of gunning down a bear.

<p>
5 Fortress also shared some of the more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2052970/view/536595840131663106?l=english">specific changes coming with the open beta</a> last month, like how the construction system has had a rework, namely introducing the ability to destroy enemy constructions, and the need to repair your construction tool to fix breached doors and windows. Sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, but the game isn't even in early access yet, there's time to change things.
</p>
<p>
Each class now has three unique construction items they can build too, and a vault/ mantle system is in the works, but that one might not be in the open beta. The open beta itself starts tomorrow, April 4th, at 4:00 PM CEST, and finishes on April 6th at 12:00 AM CEST, and there'll be another test the weekend after from April 11th to 13th. Can't wait to see what other mostly regular animals that you can turn into get added in future updates.
</p>
<p>
You can check out the game's Steam page and sign-up to its playtest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052970/STRIDEN/">here</a>.

<p>In the Call of Duty League, rostermania has been kicked into final gear in the <strong>day before </strong>the Major III qualifying stage. Moments ago, Vegas Falcons revealed that Arcitys and Priestahh will join Pred and Exnid to complete the four-man roster. </p>



<p>We’ll likely never know the size of the bag these players have been offered to represent the Vegas Falcons. Presently, the team has the worst record in COD esports history, having failed to win a single series since the season kicked off in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>The Vegas Falcons have had a woeful run, failing to win a single match since entering the Call of Duty League last year. They’re flat bottom in the standings, and unless something remarkable happens, the team is already out of this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is taking place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On social media, the Falcons team revealed the recent signing of Arcitys and Priestahh. The latter was recently dropped from LAG M8, which has also been on a monumentally miserable run of late, while the former comes up from a solid run in Challengers.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Two more World Champions have arrived to complete our roster. We’re ready to make some noise as we head into Major III Qualifiers.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Arcitys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Arcitys</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> 🦅💚 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Both of these players are former world champions, Priestahh much more recently than Arcitys. He was a part of the incredible New York Subliners roster that went on a dramatic run through the CDL 2023 season, winning Champs in record time with a 5-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>Arctiys has been out of the League since being dropped by Surge just over a year ago, but he has been in phenomenal shape in the Challengers circuit. Just days ago, he won the Dallas Open while flying the OMiT flag, and in July last year, he won the COD Challengers Final with Lore.</p>



<p>Do you think the Vegas Falcons can finally win a series? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

Accounts deemed to be in breach of this may be suspended, or have restrictions placed on them, such as being unable to receive rewards from these quests."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not cheating is one thing, but Capcom also warned that players participating in multiplayer hunts with cheaters could also result in an invalid quest completion time and the "right to rewards" revoked for everyone in the party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Please take caution to avoid playing multiplayer with those who are engaging in prohibited activity, or those you suspect of such," Capcom said. The company encouraged players who find themselves in a quest where fraudulent activity is taking place to report the cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These quests will ultimately <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/arena-quests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offer some neat rewards</a> in the form of cosmetic pendants. Some will be doled out to all participants, and others are granted based on Completion Time or the hunter's ranking.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Season 2: Hellfire Gala Official Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In Marvel Rivals Season 2, which begins April 11, the mutant Emma Frost is hosting the gala on the mutant island nation of Krakoa as a way of creating a temporary truce between the constantly fighting heroes and villains of the game's alternate Marvel universe. But every good party also has an infamous party-crasher, and in this case it's none other than the genocidal AI created by Hank Pym (aka Ant-Man)--Ultron.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase hasn't explicitly stated which new playable heroes will be added to Marvel Rivals Season 2, but judging from the trailer and artwork, it seems clear Emma Frost and Ultron will be joining the battle. One character, likely Emma, will join the roster at the start of the season, while the other will join midway through Season 2, if NetEase's release schedule stays consistent with Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-characters-will-release-much-more-often-than-you-might-expect/1100-6528797/" data-ref-id="1100-6528797">NetEase has previously stated it aims to release two new characters per season</a> (though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">Season 1 introduced all four of the Fantastic Four</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">While the new characters are obviously the star of the gala, the season's theme is also a great excuse to have all kinds of costumes that give the game's heroes and villains an excuse to dress to the nines. The Hellfire Gala has become known for its killer looks and incredible fashion, and there is no shortage of iconic Hellfire Gala outfits from Marvel Comics history for NetEase to pull from and add to the game either as part of the Season 2 battle pass or a separate purchase in the game's shop.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-mid-season-update-buffs-the-human-torch/1100-6530089/" data-ref-id="1100-6530089">latest balance update</a> brought some much-needed buffs to the game's newest DPS hero, the Human Torch, alongside some tweaks to Iron Man and Cloak and Dagger. The game continues to be among the top-played games on Steam. NetEase announced shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">Marvel Rivals' launch that 20 million players</a> had played the free-to-play hero shooter.</p>

                <p><a href="///">South of Midnight</a> <span>is Xbox's latest first-party game and the first release by Compulsion Games since the studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.</span> The southern gothic action-adventure game has its roots in a style of gameplay that's reminiscent of the OG Xbox era, and pairs that with a modern story that hits pretty hard at times. If you're wondering how long South of Midnight takes to beat, we have your answer below, including a full list of all South of Midnight chapters so you can follow along with your own progress.</p><h2>How long is South of Midnight?</h2><p>South of Midnight is a linear action-adventure game full of platforming, third-person combat, and some light puzzle-solving elements. As such, it's not meant to take up your time for weeks on end. It's here for a good time, not a long time, so says our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/south-of-midnight-review-a-love-letter-to-the-american-deep-south/1900-6418352/" data-ref-id="1900-6418352">South of Midnight review</a>.</p><p>A typical playthrough on<strong> normal difficulty will take you roughly 12-16 hours</strong>, depending on how well handle on the game's combat mechanics. Combat in the game is performed in closed-off sections of levels, so once you're in it, there's no easy way to escape it other than prevailing over the game's foes called Stigma. However, if you're defeated, <span>you<em> </em>can </span>load a save outside of the combat arena to catch your breath and maybe track down some more skill points before you try again.</p><p>This estimate changes with difficulty, naturally. If you're playing on an easier difficulty, you could likely speed through the game in about <strong>10-12 hours</strong>, while a hard-mode playthrough is going to take something like <strong>15-20 hours</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470104"></a><figcaption>Hazel's journey brings her face to face with some peculiar folks in and around the bayou.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg"></figure><h2>South of Midnight chapters list</h2><p>There are 14 chapters in in South of Midnight, and these can be replayed during or after your playthrough.

			<p>Since December, or more accurately, since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, there’s been a feeling that Xbox has turned a corner for the better. Following up MachineGames' excellent Indiana Jones adventure was Obsidian, with a more than solid outing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>. Which, in a few days from the time of publishing, will be followed up by Compulsion Games’ latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">South of Midnight</a>, which hopes to keep that momentum going.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is the third game in the studio’s history since its founding in 2009 and the first full game the team has made primarily under the Xbox banner after it was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. After the studio’s last batch of DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-happy-fews-last-dlc-we-all-fall-down-is-out-on-november-19th/">We Happy Few</a>, the six years since have been spent crafting Hazel and her mother Lacey’s story, complete with stop-motion animation. The Southern gothic tale begins with a hurricane far worse than anyone in her small fictional town of Prospero could have predicted and a fight between Hazel and Lacey.</p>
<p>After storming out of the house, Hazel looks on in horror as she watches the hurricane take her home, with her Mom in it, down the river. While chasing after the floating house to try and save her Mom, Hazel is chosen to become a new Weaver. A Weaver is a person who is able to see the strings and strands that make up what the game calls the Grand Tapestry. Basically, it is the fabric of life and the world, and it’s now Hazel’s job to help untangle the knots caused by the tragedy and pain we experience in life, either by choices of our own making or at the hands of evil people.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>The story in South of Midnight is a bit of an odd thing. Hazel’s journey toward understanding her Mom better and how their story plays out is kind of the least interesting part. At the same time, the game’s story is one of its strengths, and that all comes from the people you meet along Hazel’s journey to finding her Mom. South of Midnight’s story constantly surprised me because, from the outside, you wouldn’t guess that this game is nearly as dark or serious as it is. In each chapter, you’ll be charged with helping someone put the pain of their worst memories to rest by untangling the knot the bad parts of their lives caused.</p>
<p>And in each chapter, I was taken aback with just how intense and tragic all of these memories were. It was actually what helped to keep the story grounded, especially in the moments where Hazel is wall-running on a floating wall that looks like it’s been ripped off the side of a building.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>That’s not to say the relationship between Hazel and her Mom was boring or entirely uninteresting, just that it was out-shined by every other story told, whether in a short scene of a memory you witness or an old journal entry you find along the path. It also didn’t help that, more often than not, Hazel’s first words just after witnessing the memory of an extremely tragic event rarely fit the moment, with too many of her lines sounding like generic barks you might hear in any video game where the protagonist is constantly commenting on the world around them.</p>
<p>But there are a few moments of real, excellent storytelling with strong performances from the entire voice cast, including the voice behind Hazel, Adriyan Rae. This only made it all the more upsetting when Hazel would have a line that felt like she wasn’t paying attention to the events she just witnessed. Still, even with those disappointing moments, South of Midnight delivers an emotional story that packs a heavier punch than its bright visuals and stop-motion animation might have you expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of its visuals, the art design and the look of South of Midnight is arguably the best part of this game. I don’t mean that as a slight towards other aspects, or that it’s not worth playing. It often feels like if the best thing you have to say about a game is that it looks nice, then it probably has little to offer beyond that. Not the case with South of Midnight, as it definitely brings more to the table, but the design of this game and the detail poured into every corner is absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stop-motion animation effect did not agree with my eyes, and I did have to turn it off after playing the opening few chapters with it. I think your mileage with that effect may vary since my issues with it could also be traced to the number of stuttering bugs I witnessed during my playthrough. I was playing an early build of the game on my Xbox Series X that did not include the day-one patch, so I can only hope that the issues I have will be sorted by the time everyone else can jump in for themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of jumping, good as the story and performances are, the main gameplay of South of Midnight is what’s unfortunately lacking. The platforming isn’t bad. But it also isn’t great, and even though it evolves somewhat throughout the 14 chapters of the game’s story, particularly with the sections that have you running from a dark fog, it only starts to get interesting by the time you’re on the last couple of chapters. And by that point, these sections had been so repetitive that I was more peeved than excited to go through another one. Even if the design of these sections was starting to get good, which shouldn’t be the case in chapter 12 of a 14-chapter game.</p>
<p>The combat is, unfortunately, the worst part of the gameplay. Put simply, it’s boring and repetitive, and it wouldn’t detract from the game so much if you weren’t thrust into a combat arena every five minutes. The small skill tree you work through never adds to the combat in interesting ways; the best part about upgrading your skills is that it can help you move through these sections faster. A key issue is that there’s no flow to combat. Hazel doesn’t have a parry or a block mechanic, so all you can do is dash and dodge away from incoming attacks, which means you’re constantly pulling yourself out of the action in order to stay alive. And whether you’re locked on to a single enemy or not, the camera is awful at keeping pace with the combat, so you’re almost surely going to take a few hits that you just couldn’t prepare for because you didn’t see them coming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-4.png"></a></figure>

<p>Even when an enemy is in front of you, some attacks are more telegraphed than others, and you can only knock an enemy out of an animation by performing a ground-pound attack. It also doesn’t help that when you do take a hit, the knock-back effect makes Hazel so slow to react that you’re likely to take another hit before you can dodge to safety. That’s also where all the ‘challenge’ in the combat lies, not dying from hits you can’t see coming. Which makes any deaths you suffer frustrating for the wrong reasons. Even when you are performing well and not dying, the feedback on your attacks doesn’t feel satisfying, as you repeat the same set of animations again and again. And while the look of each enemy is interesting, what each of them adds to combat doesn’t evolve it in interesting ways or make you change your approach. This then feeds into the other issue that you don’t really get many different ways to approach combat. You’re mashing attack and dodge ad-nauseam, and when it’s over, you get a tragic, emotional scene about something awful that happened in a character’s life. The actions couldn’t feel more disconnected if they tried, which adds to combat feeling like a slog.</p>
<p>South of Midnight would be a tighter, more interesting game if the combat sections were instead replaced with gameplay akin to that of an adventure game or puzzle game, where you’re piecing together the past events to properly untangle what has become knotted. The gameplay there would also more easily weave into the game’s narrative instead of feeling like it’s trying to be an entirely different kind of game the moment combat starts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If there are any combat sections I could call out as good, it would be the few boss fights scattered throughout the game. But those sections aren’t good because the combat suddenly becomes fun, they’re good because of the scale of the bosses you’re fighting, and how well executed the presentation of each set piece is. So even though getting through to the end of a chapter isn’t all that fun with how many combat sections you have to get through, at least the set piece at the end was always visually stunning and a fun spectacle.</p>
<p>That’s also why I’d say the best of these chapter-ending set-pieces is actually one that members of the press, including Wccftech’s own Kai Tatsumoto, got to experience in <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/">previews</a>. How the music tied in with the story you had just witnessed, and the complete understanding you have about this giant tree that you’re climbing, still sticks out in my mind, days after seeing the credits roll. It was really beautiful, and I wish more of the game was able to weave gameplay and narrative as strongly as it was done there.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, speaking of the music, that is the final aspect of the storytelling that really makes South of Midnight special. The original songs written for each of the key characters from Prospero that you meet and help out are all so well done. It’s something you really have to experience for yourself, and it’s a big part of why I’d still recommend that you play South of Midnight. On top of the other visual and storytelling aspects I’ve already talked about, the music wraps it all together so beautifully.</p>

<p>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</p>

Players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p>"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Ono said. "With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4470369" data-ratio="0.53227315247895" data-width="1069" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4470369"></a><figcaption>The Switch 2 camera.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png"></figure><p>If you join a room created by a friend, players will only see people you or your friend have approved from GameChat. Before joining a room, players will see if a friend of a friend is in the room--if they don't want to join for any reason, they don't have to.</p><p>With regard to protecting the safety of children, Ono said Nintendo had a "lot of internal discussion" on this topic--it was decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list if their parent or guardian has given permission via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app.</p><p>"In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on," Ono said.</p><p>Nintendo takes an "even more cautious" approach for video chats.</p><p>"When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent's app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritize safety and require parents to approve the request every time," Ono said.</p><h2><strong>Is The Switch 2 Camera Spying On You?</strong></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a "privacy shutter" that closes when not in use--as such, players should be able to see at a glance if the camera is on or off.</p><p>"We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/code-of-conduct/">Community Guidelines</a>, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><p>In 2024, the Edward Snowden leaks revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/british-spy-agency-considered-using-xbox-360-kinect-for-surveillance/1100-6418021/" data-ref-id="1100-6418021">a British spy agency considering using Xbox 360's Kinect camera to spy on people.</a> Whether or not any actual snooping took place, however, is unknown.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 camera from Nintendo sells for $50</a>, but the console also supports a variety of USB-C cameras from other manufacturers.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">GameSpot's hands-on preview of the Switch 2</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">preview of Mario Kart World.</a> GameSpot will have lots more on the Switch 2 in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
