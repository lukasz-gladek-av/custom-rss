              <p>We’re inching closer to the second Prime Day of the year, and it’s a great time to invest in smart home devices. Amazon has started the celebration early, and we’ve just spotted the newest Amazon Echo Show 8 going for $100 on it.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward $50 discount – no coupon codes required. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">Even better, if you already own an Echo device, you can trade it in for an extra 20% off on top of the discount.</a> The offer is available on both black and white color options, but it ends soon, so you might want to act fast to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Screen, Better Sound</h2>
<p>Echo Shows have always been more than just great displays. This one packs a stunning 8-inch HD touchscreen that pushes vibrant, true-to-life visuals. The screen is paired with room-filling spatial audio, so there’s no need for external speakers to enjoy great sound, whether you’re watching a video or just vibing to your favorite song. There’s support for Netflix, Prime Video, Fire TV Channels, and more, so entertainment options are also plenty.</p>
<p>The solid 13 MP front camera with auto-framing keeps you centered during video calls, while built-in noise reduction makes sure you’re heard clearly on the other end. Of course, smart home compatibility is top-notch. Those with devices that support Zigbee, Matter, or Thread can pair and control them directly using just their voice. Need to dim the lights, but five steps to the switch feel like two miles? Just ask Echo Show to handle it. Doorbell just rang, and you want to see who’s there without getting up? Say the word.</p>



<p>And when not in use, Echo Show 8 smartly doubles as a digital picture frame, so you can keep your favorite moments close! You also have the option to invite your family and friends to share photos on the device – a great way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Setting up the whole thing and getting started is fairly simple. It sits well pretty much anywhere, but if you want better angles or prefer it at eye level, you might want to invest in a dedicated stand (sold separately). All in all, the Echo Show 8 brings a lot of convenience to your day-to-day tasks, especially if you’re looking to manage all your smart home devices in one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">This version brings better video and sound quality, and can now be yours for just $100. Be sure to grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/">shocking development</a>, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.</p><p dir="ltr">Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#3">the list goes on from there.</a></p><p dir="ltr">There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>First off, what is a leveraged buyout?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not <em>you </em>who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837" data-ratio="0.59267480577137" data-width="901" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837"></a><figcaption>A consortium of investors are attempting to buy EA for $55 billion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ea-electronic-arts-video-game-silver-lake-pif-d17dc7dd3412a990d2c0a6758aaa6900" rel="nofollow "> largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time.</a> The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to "enhance EA's mobile business" to help reach the goal.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399" rel="nofollow ">widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018</a>. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">human rights violations</a>, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as "sportswashing"--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Are layoffs coming?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to "cut costs" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).</p><p dir="ltr">Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. "I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. "There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" rel="nofollow ">filing </a>specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, "Will private ownership lead to layoffs?" The answer was, "There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction." It added that the investor consortium buying EA is "supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture," noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be "no immediate changes" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/electronic-arts-buyout-what-it-means-for-ea-saudi-arabias-pif-and-the-wider-industry" rel="nofollow ">Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said</a> EA may look to "cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" rel="nofollow ">report from Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to "cultural differences" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.</p><p dir="ltr">History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Mat Piscatella of Circana told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-shock-buyout-of-ea" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1516622011" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr"><strong>Concerns at BioWare</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" rel="nofollow ">A report from Insider Gaming</a> cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs," a current BioWare developer said. "Kind of feels like a matter of time."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/">2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets</a>. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, "We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done." They added: "It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p dir="ltr">The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the <a href="https://www.threads.com/@atsukocomedy/post/DPFMYfTgG6A?xmt=AQF0WLhWVfB0vXg0nicpbvQSKdimG6vaweCN0DAsFPENcw" rel="nofollow ">reported restrictions on what the comedians could say</a> pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-controversy-1236389190/" rel="nofollow ">Bill Burr said this was overblown</a>, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>PIF could be a "hands-off" owner</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The PIF, through its Savvy Games label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company "experienced no relocation or mass layoffs" from the buyout. "The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires," Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.</p><p dir="ltr">"Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is "relatively underdeveloped" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.</p><p dir="ltr">"A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments," he said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A "step change" for the PIF</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a "step change in commitment," Harding-Rolls said. "The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.</p><p dir="ltr">"EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance," Harding-Rolls said. "EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports."</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia previously outlined a <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/explore/strategies/national-gaming-and-esports-strategy" rel="nofollow ">"Vision 2030" plan</a> to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.</p><p dir="ltr">A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry," Harding-Rolls said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Not a done deal yet</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to "customary closing conditions," including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius" rel="nofollow ">Committee on Foreign Investment</a>, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Further obfuscation of key data points</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a "knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally." Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>"I'd be really excited," former EA dev says of going private</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with <a href="http://gi.biz/" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that, "I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail." Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.</p><p dir="ltr">"However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design," she said. "You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate."</p><p dir="ltr">"EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time," she added.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on "long-term strategies and investments." Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Could another company swoop in to buy EA?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop," he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Read the full merger agreement</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're a sicko like me, you may want to read the entire merger agreement for yourself. Thankfully, a number of documents are available on the SEC's website,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036415/ef20056167_ex2-1.htm" rel="nofollow "> including the 80-page merger agreement document</a> that outlines all the key particulars of the proposed sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Resolution Games has announced a release date for their upcoming digital boardgame crossover, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. The game will be launching across PC, PS5, PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 on 20th November, with a demo arriving in time for Steam Next Fest on 13th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kasgPB71yLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While it’s a contender for one of the most word salad-y game names of the year, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked – DxD&amp;D:B for short – is an exciting combination of the digital tabletop adventuring of Demeo and the themes and familiar setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. injecting more narrative and things to do between quests. That said, the main focus is really on combat and not the broader adventuring of either video game or tabletop D&amp;D.</p>
<p>The gameplay trailer showcases some of these, so characters now have skill tree upgrades to work through, you can visit a tavern and grab side quests, and of course the dice system has become D20-based (albeit with simplified icons so you don’t have to cross reference numbers)</p>
<p>Available from 13th to 20th October, the demo will provide players with two quests from the game’s first campaign, and let you explore some of the bespoke characters and their classes. You’ve got the dragonborn paladin, Bolthrax; the halfling sorcerer, Tibby; the human ranger Jessix; and the tiefling rogue, Ash. Two more characters – the dwarven fighter Tharok and elf bard Lyria – will be available in the full game.</p>

<p>The demo, just as with the full game, will be playable solo or with up to four players, taking on a goblin ambush in Neverwinter Wood and then explore a Myconid colony where the typically-serene fungi have become suspiciously hostile.</p>
<p>Playing the demo and defeating both quests will reward players of the full game with two special skins for the Battlemarked 20-sided dice.</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">the original Demeo</a>, it was one of my favourite games from the PSVR 2 launch, and I said, “Demeo is a fun and accessible digital board game, evoking games like HeroQuest with its turn-based dungeon-crawling. In VR it’s a pleasingly tactile experience that’s great to share with co-op friends, but if you need or prefer to play on a TV screen? Well that’s still good too.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-can-be-chill-or-brutal-with-its-new-cinematic-modes.1314823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Ghost</em> games aim to make you feel like you’re playing a classic samurai movie. To make the connection more obvious, <em><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></em> added a black-and-white mode made in collaboration with the estate of <em>Seven Samurai</em> director Akira Kurosawa. The sequel <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> builds on that by bringing back the Kurosawa mode and adding two more “cinematic modes” made in collaboration with famous filmmakers: one inspired by <em>13 Assassins</em> director Takashi Miike with a tighter camera during fights, and one inspired by <em>Samurai Champloo</em> director Shinichirō Watanabe that adds lo-fi beats.</p><p>With <em>Yōtei</em>, “we’re standing on the shoulders of a previously made game,” Jason Connell, co-creative director at developer Sucker Punch, tells <em>The Verge</em>. This time, the “quest” was to celebrate two other artists.</p><p>Kurosawa mode is the most striking mode. In addition to switching <em>Yōtei</em>’s colorful, saturated aesthetic into black and white, the audio is a bit more muffled, like it is in classic films — voices in particular sound tinny, which I think is a cool old-school touch — and there’s additional wind to add more motion to what you see on screen. “As soon as you take color out of the picture, it really changes your perspective and what you’re looking at,” Connell says, adding that depth has “different meaning” in black and white.</p><p>Miike mode is more subtle: during fights, the camera is much closer to <em>Yōtei</em>’s protagonist, Atsu, and you’ll see more blood and mud. The development team has “always wanted” a camera mode that is more pushed in so that “you can get a more visceral experience,” Connell says, and paying homage to Takashi Miike gave them a way to do it. The mode means that fights can be more difficult; <em>Yōtei</em> usually has a zoomed-back camera during battles that gives you a wide view of your opponents. But it also makes the already aggressive and violent fights feel more intense.</p><p>Watanabe mode, on the other hand, is much more chill, switching out the game’s usual soundtrack for a selection of lo-fi songs created under the direction of Watanabe that you’ll hear during exploration and some fights. I’ve loved turning on Watanabe mode when I don’t have a specific goal in mind, as the lo-fi music helps me settle into wandering instead of being laser-focused on the next objective. (You won’t hear the Watanabe beats in story missions because the game has specific orchestrations set up for those events, Connell says.)</p><p>Connell says that <em>Tsushima</em> players were already punching into the action in their photo mode shots or playing the game with lo-fi music. To me, they’re good for specific moments, but it’s often weird to play the game with them on for extended sessions. For example, Kurosawa mode makes many of the story cutscenes feel much more cinematic, but during an elaborate infiltration mission, the black-and-white visuals made seeing enemies and finding places to hide particularly tricky, so I turned it off.</p><p>Connell acknowledges that sometimes the modes and what you’re doing in the game can be anachronistic. But he says that since players have to opt in to the modes, “we feel it’s an okay area for people to customize the game to their own liking.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789026/ghost-of-yotei-cinematic-modes-kurosawa-miike-watanabe]]></content:encoded>

By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

 <h2>Devs at <em>Disco Elysium</em> studio ZA/UM just unionized</h2> <p>The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>&nbsp;reports</a>. The change comes after the cancellation of a <em>Disco Elysium</em> sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads.</p>

 <p>“It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, <em>Zero Parades for Spies</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">at Sony’s most recent State of Play</a>.</p>

That was after several <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973439369680920744">viral posts</a> dunking on the latest Xbox move. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last.</p>

 <h2><em>Dune: Awakening</em> dev is laying people off despite a huge launch</h2> <p>Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release we’ve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since.</p>

 <p>“The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a> in a statement.</p> <h2>Someone got their $1000 Xbox handheld early</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon France has accidentally shipped an Xbox Ally X early to a Reddit user 🙃 <a href="https://t.co/iTofLme10L">https://t.co/iTofLme10L</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qh3Jc6N9YX">pic.twitter.com/Qh3Jc6N9YX</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1973156450664058891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“It’s a good console,” wrote TechnicalFun77 on the Asus Rog Ally subreddit (via <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-guy-got-rog-xbox-ally-x-early-thanks-to-amazons-mistake/1100-6535158/">GameSpot</a></em>). “Very good ergonomics, controlled weight, pretty nice handheld, armory crate in the full screen experience is very responsive, no latency problem when pressing buttons, quite fluid in the menus in general, and superb battery life at 17-25w. And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ghost of Yōtei Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it's continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time," Fleming said. "If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular. But we only get to do one thing. So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that's really clarifying. It's not like there aren't 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years … that's a really big decision, so you better think carefully about it."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sorry-sly-cooper-fans-but-it-sounds-like-sucker-punch-just-isnt-interested-in-making-another-one/1100-6534653/" data-ref-id="1100-6534653">Sly Cooper</a> has been dormant for over a decade at this point.

In his assessment, writer Richard Wakeling said, "As a sequel, familiarity is baked in, but every alteration is in service of Atsu and her profound differences, making for a game that manages to feel distinct even when what you're doing is so recognizable."

		<p>Sometimes, you get to take joy in everything new and fresh. In experiences that you’ve never previously imagined.&nbsp; Other times, it’s the known, the cosy, the comfortable that invites you in like a long-lost friend. So it is today, with the latest release from Plaion Replai, where they invite you to ‘Unlock 1982’, with the announcement of physical re-releases of old-school classics Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig-Dug and Xevious for the Atari 2600+ and Atari 7800+, all of which are fully compatible with the original Atari 7800.</p>
<p><iframe title="GALAGA, PAC-MAN Double Feature, DIG DUG, XEVIOUS | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhmXfUCePf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>1982 was the year that arcade gaming really hit its stride, with all four of these classic titles arriving in the space of 12 months. Admittedly, a good proportion of people reading this probably weren’t alive – or perhaps only just – in 1982, but if you’re a fan of gaming you won’t have escaped the long term legacy of each of these games. Heck, a new Pac-Man game came out last week!</p>
<p>Details of the four games can be found here:</p>
<p><b>GALAGA – Alien Swarm Attack!</b><br>
Defend your starfighter against endless waves of alien attackers in one of the greatest arcade shooters of all time.&nbsp; Rescue captured ships, unleash dual-fighter firepower, and prove yourself in a timeless battle for the high score.</p>

<p><b>PAC-MAN Double Feature – Two Games. One Legend.</b><br>
The world’s most famous maze-chaser returns in a special double feature: the classic Atari 2600 release alongside the upgraded Atari 7800 edition.&nbsp; Outsmart Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in two definitive versions of PAC-MAN.</p>
<p><b><span lang="SV">Dig Dug – Dig Deep. Pump Fast!</span></b><span lang="SV"><br>
</span>Grab your pump and tunnel underground in Namco’s quirky action-puzzler.&nbsp; Trap enemies, inflate them until they pop, or crush them with rocks in a unique blend of strategy and arcade action.</p>
<p><b>Xevious – Blast the Sky. Bomb the Earth.</b><br>
Pilot the Solvalou fighter in one of the most influential vertical shooters ever made.&nbsp; Master dual attacks – lasers for airborne enemies, bombs for ground targets, and uncover hidden secrets as you battle for humanity’s survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games aren’t just nostalgic releases, they’re cultural touchstones,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Ben Jones, Commercial Director of PLAION REPLAI.&nbsp;&nbsp;“With GALAGA as our flagship, and PAC-MAN, Dig Dug, and Xevious completing the set, we’re celebrating 1982 as the year that defined the golden age of arcades.&nbsp; We want fans old and new to unlock that moment in time and experience it all over again on Atari consoles.”</p>

<p>Hall effect sticks? Check</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PowerA has launched a new wireless controller for the Switch 2 (with compatibility confirmed for the OG, Lite, and OLED too), boasting features that could give the official Pro Controller a run for its money.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£54.99 / $69.99</strong>, the Advantage Wireless Controller will come in three flavours: Black, Mario &amp; Friends, and Pokémon: Mega Evolutions. It comes with Hall Effect analogue sticks, motion controls, a dedicated C button, mappable back buttons, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, being a third-party pad, you're not going to get <em>everything</em>, so NFC amiibo support isn't here, and it doesn't seem like these controllers will have wake-up support for the Switch 2 either. Still, at £20 less than the $89.99 asking price for the Pro Controller, the monetary saving could potentially make up for these exclusions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>• Hall Effect Modules:</strong> Contact-free magnetic sensors in the thumbsticks provide a more fluid pro-level feel and help with precision and longevity<strong><br>
• Advanced Gaming Buttons:</strong> Get an edge over the competition with mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons you can program on the fly, mid-game—no system settings to configure<strong><br>
• Intuitive Motion Controls:</strong> Get immersed in your games with fluid, responsive motion controls that provide an intuitive way to aim, steer, fly, and more<strong><br>
• C Button:</strong> Easily activate fun GameChat features<strong><br>
• Rechargeable Battery:</strong> Get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Includes an extra-long 10 ft. USB-C cable to recharge the internal battery*<strong><br>
• Ergonomic Design:</strong> Game for hours with a controller that feels great in your hands, thanks to cutting-edge ergonomics and top-of-the-line materials<strong><br>
• Nintendo Family Compatibility:</strong> Works with the Nintendo Switch system of devices: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and Nintendo Switch Lite<strong><br>
• Officially Licensed:</strong> PowerA products have gone through Nintendo’s rigorous testing and evaluation processes to ensure compatibility with the Nintendo Switch 2 system</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-and-zero-parades-developers-za-um-form-workers-alliance-union-at-uk-branch.1314796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, the same team of developers now working on an espionage RPG in a similar vein to Disco Elysium, titled Zero Parades: For Dead Spies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">which Wccftech recently previewed</a>), have formed a union at ZA/UM's UK branch called the Workers Alliance, represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).</p>



<p>The news was announced with a blog post on the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">IWGB Game Workers website</a> and in an interview with ZA/UM developers on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. According to the IWGB, the Workers Alliance at ZA/UM UK is "<em>the UK's first recognized games industry union</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>I think the workers at ZA/UM all agree that we have something unique at the studio that we want to preserve for years to come</em>," Poppy Ingham, marketing manager at ZA/UM in the UK, told GI.Biz. UI/UX designer Declan Keane added "<em>The more I've worked here, the more I've realized that what we have is a unique makeup of people, and the union is a large effort to solidify that</em>. <em>Instead of thinking about what the next year will look like, we'll be working together, taking what we've learned already and doubling down on that. I want to play the games that this team makes</em>."</p>



<p>Following the release of Disco Elysium in 2019, a string of controversies followed ZA/UM, with the core creatives on Disco very publicly leaving the studio and claiming to have been ousted by ZA/UM's executive branch, with game director and writer on Disco, Robert Kurvitz, writing an open letter to players claiming the studio had been stolen from him and the rest of the studio's creatives in 2022. </p>



<p>Kurvitz also accused the studio's chief executive officer, Ilmar Kompus, of fraud. Kompus fired back with accusations against Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov that they created a toxic working environment at ZA/UM. Lawsuits were filed shortly after and are still ongoing to this day.</p>



<p>What followed in the wake were two extended documentaries from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a> that attempted to break down what happened at ZA/UM, three project cancellations, including a sequel to Disco being cancelled and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">expansion for the original game that resulted in layoffs last year</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/">founding of multiple studios</a> each started by various members of the key creative team behind the original Disco.</p>



<p>Now, the remaining workers at ZA/UM, many of whom did work on the original Disco, but none of whom were the original key writers on the project, are hoping to ensure that ZA/UM remains a good place to work. While many former developers have had less-than-positive things to say about the studio and its conditions, Ingham and other members of the studio's union look to this formation as a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>"<em>The hope for the future</em> of <em>ZA/UM is just to continue what we're doing, but in a very secure and comfortable position now that we have a union established, and to really challenge the studio and the studio's management in the best way possible, to make sure that we're putting ZA/UM out there as the best place to work in the industry - we take care of our staff, we have a union to push the things we require, and we can preserve the talent that we have here</em>."</p>

              <p>In the wake of the phenomenal success of <em>Balatro</em>, we are going to be treated to all manner of gambling-adjacent roguelites. And bring them on, I say! Coming soon we have picture-pairs deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509430/Replicat/"><em>Replicat</em></a>, another cat-themed game in Mahjong-based roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3332060/Feng_Shui_Meowjong/"><em>Feng Shui: Meowjong</em></a>, and deckbuilding-meets-slot-machine-meets-rune-matching game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073990/Runeborn/"><em>Runeborn</em></a> (which is out next week). One of the first to reach us, however, is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/?curator_clanid=38011635"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, a slot-machine-themed game that takes the inherent sadness of plunging all your money into a cold, indifferent machine to a grim, deadly place. And it’s very tough to stop playing.</p> <p>There’s something fundamentally sad about a slot machine. First and foremost, because they’re the grimmest form of gambling: there’s no skill involved at all because every single machine is&nbsp;<em>fixed</em>, paying out when its programming tells it to, and designed to always take in far more than it ever gives. There’s also something unpleasantly ironic about their bright, cheerful presentation, colorful fruits and gems spinning around as a hundred colored lights flash on and off in enticing patterns, all designed to take your money. It’s within this contradiction that <em>CloverPit</em> makes its home, presenting its rotating fruits and treasures on a dilapidated machine, complete with a very concerning blood stain on one corner, and put inside a small, grimy cell-like room. Oh, and if you don’t win enough money, you die.</p>

 <p>There’s a demonic nature to all the proceedings, the game’s dirty pixel graphics reminiscent of 2021’s horror card game <em>Inscryption</em> (one of a number of games with which it can be bought in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58319/CloverPit_x_Inscryption/">a two-game bundle</a>), and a subtitled narrator mockingly explaining your predicament. You need to make a fixed number of coins within three rounds of playing on the slot machine, and if you fall short the floor opens up beneath you and you fall to your death. Should you succeed, the target goes up for what it calls a new Deadline, and three more rounds begin.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631035"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631035">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course there’s a lot more to it than that. Through playing you not only win coins, but also tickets, and these can be used to buy “lucky charms” from a small cabinet behind you. The randomly selected items (chosen from an ever-growing number that are unlocked through reaching certain milestones as you play, one of which involves going for a shit in the room’s filthy toilet) add detailed bonuses, like giving more value to certain symbols or causing other symbols to appear more often, or perhaps randomly triggering the chance for an extra spin in a round. The more you play, the more complicated these bonuses can be, like Fortune Teller’s “25% chance for the chain modifier to be applied to any symbol, decreased by 5% at the end of every round,” where chain modifiers improve the value of particular patterns formed by matching symbols on the three-by-five slot machine display…Like I said, it gets complicated.</p>

 <p>Another crucial element is that for each round, you can choose to play three spins and receive two tickets at the end, or play seven spins and get only one ticket. That imbalance is perfect, forcing you to significantly sacrifice winnings to unlock a more expensive Charm, or risk not getting more bonuses and just going to spins. On top of this, between each Deadline a dirty, red phone will ring, <em>Deal or No Deal</em>-style, and you’re offered the choice of one of three buffs or debuffs. Oh, and there are drawers you can unlock, and there’s a little computer that stores data on all the Charms you’ve unlocked, and the requirements for those you’ve not. It’s an impressive amount to pack into one tiny little prison.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631034">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>‘s greatest advantage is that, just like in real life, those one-armed bandits are compelling machines. There’s a reason we have the cliche of the tragic, hunched figure, feeding coin after coin into the Las Vegas slot machine at 3 a.m. Just pulling the virtual arm in the game and seeing the symbols spin around is enticing. And like real fruit machines, the results are very fixed. Your “luck” is a measurable metric in the game, boosted by Charms, increasing the likelihood of high-scoring patterns of cherries and lemons appearing. This, as it happens, is also the game’s greatest weakness.</p>

 <p>The comparisons with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> are very much invited when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58846/CloverPit__Balatro/">the game can be bought bundled with it</a>. But while&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>‘s poker-themed rogue-ish ways certainly involve a great deal of luck, there’s also an enormous amount of skill involved in shaping a good run from the elements thrown at you. This definitely feels less the case in <em>CloverPit</em> in which, despite the intricacies of the available Lucky Charms and the enormous bonuses available should you wisely combine the attributes of those which work well together, it still always feels far too much like your chance of completing a Deadline can come down to whether the game decides to throw a super-successful spin your way. While you <em>can&nbsp;</em>improve your luck, you can’t purposefully bring on a “jackpot” where every single symbol matches, and you’re pretty certain to earn enough cash.</p>

 <p>It’s also the case that the Charms don’t add anywhere near as much variety to a run as the dozens of different ways you can approach a run at <em>Balatro</em>. This game lacks that sense of, “Oh, I reckon this should be a three-of-a-kind run,” based on your early jokers and planet cards. Instead, you just sort of play the best of what you get, and hope it works out. When it doesn’t, you die and start over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631036">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The important thing is that starting over remains very compelling. It’s a fast game, nippily speeding through its various elements, meaning you’re never left frustrated by a bad predicament. And of course, the more you play, the more becomes revealed, like what those drawers are for and why, when you put a Charm inside one in one run, it’s replaced by a severed piece of a corpse in the next. Yeah, that’s a thing.</p> <p>That creepiness adds a lot to&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>, with the overriding questions of why exactly you’re being tortured in a disgusting pit with a murderous slot machine always haunting you. It’s splendid how just about every element feels&nbsp;<em>wrong.&nbsp;</em>I mean, I completely forgot to mention the flies buzzing around the bin of what I think might be meat that sits below the slot machine itself.</p> <p>So while this doesn’t manage to survive a comparison with the titan that is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it’s also the case that no one ever said it should have to. Though I’d love to feel a bit more autonomy over my chances of success, this is ultimately a game about the unfairness of a slot machine that’ll make you want to experience it over and over and over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now only four weeks out from the NYC marathon. It’s time to make sure you have all the gear you need picked out. What shorts you’re wearing, perhaps a belt to carry your phone, maybe a fresh pair of running shoes if your current pair are reaching their limit — lots of prep to be done. My question is, how satisfied are you with your watch? Do you even have a watch? Some folks in my run club choose to just carry their phone in hand. It always irks me when I’ve forgotten to charge my watch and now need to run with my phone, I can’t imagine just choosing to do that every time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Well, anyway, right now Garmin has its Forerunner 55 GPS watch on sale ahead of Prime Big Deals Day, going for 25% off.</a> You can save $50 as the price comes down from $200 to just $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Garmin Coach</h2>
<p>A GPS watch is your window into your performance. Track your miles, pace, time elapsed and more. The Garmin Forerunner 55 goes even further than than, able to act as your fitness coach. It can provide you with daily suggestions of varying intensities based on previous workouts and fitness level, tailoring your training to you. You can even plan your race day strategy with PacePro, offering GPS-based pace guidance for various courses or distances.</p>
<p>Beyond running, this watch can be used for cycling, Pilates, and even pool swims. When not being used for a workout, the watch can track useful health and wellness metrics such as your heart rate. A favorite feature of mine is Body Battery. This breaks down all your activity, heart rate, and other bits of data to estimate your energy level at any time throughout your day, allowing your to find the best time to either workout or get your rest in.</p>



<p>The Garmin Forerunner 55 has a 1.04-inch capacitive touch screen. It uses a transflective memory-in-pixel display which allows it to be seen clearly in direct sunlight and total darkness alike.</p>
<p>Battery life is super solid. The issue with using a smartwatch like the Apple Watch or a Samsung Galaxy Watch as your running watch is you’ll have to plug it in almost every night for a recharge. The Garmin Forerunner 55 can last up to two weeks. And like those other smartwatches, you can even receive emails, texts and other notifications right on your wrist after pairing it with your phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Choose between three different colors. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is available in either black, aqua, or white — all now discounted down to just $150.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a><span>, Sucker Punch’s samurai sequel, takes place hundreds of years after the original game, </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushim</span></i><span>a. Normally, when a studio sets a sequel this long after the first, it’s to make it easier for newcomers to jump in, and they don’t have to worry so much about continuity between previous games. For the most part, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>is pretty separate from </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>, but it does have one side quest that directly ties the two together, answers some questions about what happened to the previous protagonist, Jin Sakai, and maybe raises a few more.</span></p>  <p><span>In the side quest titled “The Storm Blade,” <em>Yotei</em> protagonist Atsu is guided through a discrete area in Mount Yotei, which includes what looks like a centuries-old weapon cache full of some items fans might recognize, like a helmet and a horse saddle. As Atsu climbs through the area, she finds Jin Sakai’s sword hidden in a cave. Just then, however, she’s waylaid by enemies, one of whom steals the blade and makes his escape, prompting Atsu to give pursuit. Tracking him down, she also finds what seems to be Jin’s final home and resting place. We then learn from Ugetsu, the game’s resident storyteller, that Jin went on to become the first Shinobi and that “some say” he lived out his final days in Ezo. Once you complete the quest, you’ll get Jin’s sword and armor set.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re not planning on playing </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>yourself and want to see the full quest, here’s the whole thing courtesy of Ben-Gun on YouTube (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/5-years-later-ghost-of-yotei-finally-reveals-what-happened-to-jin-sakai-after-ghost-of-tsushima-in-a-secret-side-quest/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><i><span>).</span></i></p>   <p><span>Now that we know where Jin ended up after </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, there are still questions about what he was doing in Ezo and how he ultimately met his end. However, at least fans will have some closure here. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a> <span>is out today on PlayStation 5, and it sounds like it’s a pretty good successor to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290"><span>Sucker Punch’s</span></a><span> open-world samurai game, even if </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><span>it doesn’t really shake things up too much</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced a price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raising the price by 50% from $20 to $30 per month</a>. You do not have to pay that much everywhere, however. GameStop, for example, has <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will not raise the price of Game Pass Ultimate for in-store and online shoppers, at least not yet.</p><p>The retailer continues to sell one-month Game Pass Ultimate memberships for $20 or three-month memberships for $60. This appears to be a promotion, so it's not likely to last forever, meaning you may want to snap it up now before it's too late.

The price hike for Game Pass followed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price increase of consoles, too.</a></p><p>Price increases were always expected, though, as subscription services are known to debut at a low price to drive adoption and then go up in price as the company behind them looks to monetize the base of subscribers. Still, the 50% price hike was more than many expected for Game Pass Ultimate, even with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">newly added perks like Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. </a></p><p>PC Game Pass is also going up in price, from $12/month to $16.50/month.

<p>Game launches this month!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (with a brief mention of the OG Switch version at the end), providing more than 6 minutes of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, Z-A is the sort-of-sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> and takes place in Lumiose City with a revamped real-time battle system. The trailer goes over this along with the character customisation features, photo mode, the 'Z-A Royale Tournament', and more.</p>
<p>If you think the game looks a bit naff visually, you're not alone, and this trailer won't do much to convince you otherwise (though the interiors in 'Hotel Z' look pretty nice, admittedly), but it definitely looks like a pretty neat take on the long-running series nonetheless. We're pretty concerned about how this might look and run on the original Switch, though.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. Some of the new mechanics and modes here sound genuinely interesting, and hopefully this will more than make up for any visual or performance shortcomings.</p>
<p>Legends: Z-A will also offer up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a> for <strong>£24.99</strong>, with early adopters receiving apparel sets on day one, with a story expansion arriving at some point before the end of February 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-galaxy-deserves-more.1314730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has brought two of the very best <em>Super Mario</em> games to the Switch and Switch 2. <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> and its sequel have been remastered for Nintendo’s latest hardware with a handful of upgrades, and they’re available starting today. It’s no surprise that they’re excellent; these are critically acclaimed games, and two of the best-selling titles for the Wii, Nintendo’s top-selling console prior to the Switch era. So it’s great to have a pair of the most inventive platformers ever made easily accessible in 2025. At the same time, these releases are disappointing in just how simple they are. Nintendo has an enviable amount of history and talent, and re-releases like this would be the ideal place to share that with the world. Alas, we get straightforward ports instead.</p><p>The <em>Galaxy</em> games, which originally debuted in 2007 and 2010, represent a sort of evolutionary offshoot of the 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming line. The sci-fi premise — which, among other things, introduced Rosalina to the world — involves Mario traveling to small planets, many of which are bite-sized spheres that fit on a single screen. The goal, as always, is to collect shiny stars to open up more levels to explore. But what makes <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel unique is how tightly-focused every level is. Each usually has a single idea that it explores <em>just</em> long enough before moving on to the next thing.</p><p>That design-first focus means that these games have aged remarkably well. It feels weird at first to not have complete control over the camera, but I adjusted pretty quickly, helped along by the fact that the levels are almost all small and designed around those camera limitations. Like the best <em>Super Mario</em> games, these are an explosion of ideas; one second you’re fighting against gravity while side-scrolling inside of a giant pill, the next you’re using Yoshi’s tongue to flip across perilous gaps. Given the way the <em>Super Mario</em> series has evolved, going in very different directions with releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">the more open-ended <em>Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">the silly side-scrolling of <em>Wonder</em></a><em>,</em> there remains nothing like <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel.</p><p>I also love that playing with detached Joy-Con controllers is a pretty solid approximation of using an old Wii remote and nunchuk, a control scheme the original games were built around. (You’ll be doing a lot of pointing at the screen here.) Both <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel also still look great; the mix of classic, cartoony Mario style and glittery sci-fi locales work really well together.</p><p>Which is probably why Nintendo hasn’t done much for these ports — they don’t need a lot of work to begin with. The resolution is a little better, there are touchscreen controls for when you’re playing in portable mode, the storybook elements have been expanded somewhat, and there’s a very welcome new “assist” mode that makes things a little easier. Even still, considering these releases cost $40 each (or $70 as a physical bundle) the lack of frills is disappointing.</p><p>This is pretty much par for the course for Nintendo. The most recent re-release of the first <em>Galaxy</em> came in the form of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em></a>, a similarly barebones collection on the original Switch that was inexplicably only available for a limited time. So I’m conflicted here. Yes, this is a chance for a whole new audience to play two incredible games. But would it have killed Nintendo to show these games just a little more love? To treat them like more than promotional fodder for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">the next <em>Super Mario</em> movie</a>?</p><p>Maybe I’m spoiled by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">Digital Eclipse</a> and the Criterion Collection, but it’s clear that Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">a company that has its own museum, for crying out loud</a> — could do a lot more to celebrate its most innovative and successful games. It’s a company with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16577860/super-mario-odyssey-travel-interview-kenta-motokura">creative</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">talent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki">that</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview">sticks</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">around</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18759918/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-takashi-tezuka-interview">for decades</a>, each of whom is full of insights into how these games get made. With all of the inventiveness on display in <em>Galaxy</em>, it’s prime material for such a celebration.</p><p>It doesn’t seem like that will happen any time soon, though. So in the meantime I’ll just repeat the obvious: <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> still rules.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

              <p>December feels forever away but here’s the thing: <strong>LEGO drops its Advent calendars in September</strong> for a reason. And if you’ve ever waited until November, you already know the truth: by then, the deals are gone, the stock’s low and you’re stuck paying full price. But right now, the LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 (the most loved one in the lineup) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">is hiding on Amazon at an all-time low of just $25, down from $34.99</a>, and it’s available for everyone, Prime or not, until tomorrow night.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Holiday Countdown That Feels Like Magic</h2>
<p>This isn’t just a calendar: It’s 24 bursts of joy, one door per day. Your kid (or you?) gets to open a fresh surprise every morning—mini builds, fun accessories, and adorable mini-figures—all the way through to Christmas. And what about the mini-figs: Santa and Mrs. Claus are on the job, along with laugh-out-loud hilarious characters of Santa in a reindeer costume, Mrs. Claus as a polar bear, and even Mrs. Claus as a walking Christmas tree.</p>



<p>The great part? It’s made for kids 5 and up and each little build has simple instructions tucked just behind the door. No frustration, no confusing instructions – just the happy “aha!” moment when they click the pieces into place. And the pièce de résistance: <strong>the calendar flips open into a big playmat</strong>. One minute it’s a countdown, the next it’s a winter wonderland holiday party scene where all the figures come to life. Kids can mix and match their other LEGO City sets, build wacky scenarios and play for hours.</p>
<p>Parents, pay attention: how many times can you receive a gift that provides something new each day? That keeps the anticipation going, promotes patience and sparks creativity without the use of a screen? This calendar does all of the above – and it’s only $25 today at Amazon. That’s close to a ten-dollar discount, and it doesn’t often go this low except for Prime Day or Black Friday.</p>

            <p>If you've been wondering what happened to the FIFA licence <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after its departure from EA</a>, you now have the answer. FIFA Heroes has just been announced today, a 5-a-side football game starring several official FIFA mascots.</p>
<p>These mascots, presented in the announce trailer absent from gameplay footage, are cartoony representatives from three major countries. These include Clutch the eagle from the USA, Zayu the jaguar from Mexico, and of course Maple the moose from Canada.</p>
<p>These mascots will, according to the official press release coinciding with the announcement trailer, have their own "super abilities and special moves" in FIFA Heroes. Players will be able to play in PvE matches as well as online PvP, of course.</p>

<p>Christian Volk, Director of Gaming and eSports at FIFA, wrote in the FIFA Heroes press release: "At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority. With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who've grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem."</p><p>Maybe it'll be good, but it's a significant departure from FIFA's previous incarnation within the video game industry. The old FIFA series, now EAFC, had built itself a sizable market share of the sports genre with its realistic depiction of football and its many professional players. FIFA Heroes, on the other hand, is taking the polar opposite approach.</p>
<p>FIFA Heroes will be available in 2026, though the specific date remains unknown. It'll be available on mobile, Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The news comes this week as EA releases its latest EA FC game, EAFC26. The game appears to be going down well among its fan-base, retaining much of the merits of the series' prior EAFC titles as well as the FIFA series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">EA parted with the FIFA brand back in 2022, but has remained the most popular football series despite the brand shift.</a>.

			<p>LEGO Voyagers might just be the cutest game ever. As my partner and I guided our adorable single-block Lego pieces though this co-op puzzle platformer, we emitted many a coo of ‘ooohhhh’ and ‘aaahhhh’, and thankfully it wasn’t followed by running and screaming. But is there more to Light Brick Studios’ latest LEGO adventure than looking disarmingly delightful?</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idgrndka0AQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Akin to the local and online co-op experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">offered by Hazelight Studios</a>, Lego Voyagers requires two players to work together to navigate through its isometric levels. Your eyed Lego pieces are steered like rolling wagon wheels, tumbling through the environment with clumsy abandon. Most of the levels are made up of those smooth Lego pieces that are much easier to dust on your display models than the studded ones. Though, every now and again, you’ll find some studs to attach to with the tap of a button. Like Katamari Damacy, you can end up coated in chunks of plastic, each impacting the physics of your character, causing you to trundle hilariously – and precariously – around the place.</p>


<p>Even better, both players can connect together with a stupendously satisfying ‘click’, and then can both take control of your Frankenstein-like Lego monstrosity, requiring you to work together to get around the place. It’s tremendous silly fun, and, thanks to a very quick respawn, frustration caused by the chaos is kept to an absolute minimum. Having said that, despite the kid friendly visuals, I can’t help but feel that the challenging physics-based controls might not make this one suitable to play with the smallest Lego-fans in your family.</p>


<p>Platforming is simple, which is a relief, as the isometric viewpoint prevents anything more complex. Even simple jumps are made agonisingly tricky by often being unable to tell where your player character is in the space. Once more, that aforementioned rapid respawn saves the day. Even if you’ve failed a basic jump several times or more, you’re hurled back into the action before irritation sets in.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hit and miss platforming, the puzzles are a delight, requiring both players to work together to solve numerous satisfyingly brain-ticking conundrums. One player might be tasked with controlling a bridge say, whilst the other player crosses it safely – or unsafely, if the first player is feeling cheeky. In my case, I often am.</p>
<p>The best puzzles are those that involve building something together from the random bits and bobs you find littered around the landscape. Often, you don’t quite know what you are building until suddenly the penny drops and you realise, you’re halfway through constructing a catapult to haphazardly fling your buddy over a hazardous ravine! Or, in a page straight out of Hazelight Studios’ co-op book, you’re tasked with controlling a boat together, one playing steering, the other accelerating. It’s easy charming fun, the game breezily flinging ideas at you, never waiting too long before moving onto the next one.</p>

<p>The only downside? It’s all over far too quickly. As such, it never quite feels like the game explores any one idea to a satisfying conclusion. You do a bit of something, it’s enjoyable, but it always feels like the mechanic could be further explored. Light Brick Studios clearly doesn’t want to stick with an idea too long, just in case you get bored. This, combined with a very short run time of a handful of hours, means that whilst Lego Voyagers is tremendous fun, it’s likely done and forgotten before the end credits have finished rolling.</p>

<p>The GeForce NOW RTX Blackwell upgrade started rolling out last month. You can read my impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>:</p>



<p><em>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[FIFA Heroes Is an Arcade-Style 5v5 Soccer Game Coming Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-heroes-announced-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fifa-heroes-is-an-arcade-style-5v5-soccer-game-coming-next-year.1314703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soccer governing body FIFA, together with New York-based development studio Enver, has announced&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, a new 5v5 arcade-style soccer (or "football", for the enlightened) game coming to consoles and mobile next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>will be "an arcade fast 5-a-side" game with "fantasy flair", and it'll feature iconic FIFA mascots, "football's biggest icons, and your favorite fictional characters from iconic TV shows and films".</p>

<p>Enver and FIFA are promising "dynamic physics and pitch-shattering power moves", so it's pretty clear that this isn't an&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>-style realistic simulation, as if the larger-than-life cast list outlined above didn't already give the (beautiful) game away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=TYDfcYDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=EhoOALGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know much about&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>&nbsp;yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature both PvE and PvP play modes; Enver and FIFA say you'll be able to "tackle PvE before going head to head with your mates" across "arcade fast matches and challenges", which will also help you "progress your club through PvE career milestones".</p>

<p>If you're a football aficionado, you'll know that the World Cup next year is being held across three host countries, and each of those countries' mascots is represented here: Maple for Canada, Clutch for the US, and Zayu for Mexico.</p>

<p>They're just three of the playable characters in&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, each of whom will have "their own super abilities and special moves", although it's not clear whether that's true of all of the playables or just the mascots.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>right here, although it's worth saying that it's more of a concept piece, since there's no identifiable gameplay in the trailer.</p>




<p><em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>is the latest officially-licensed&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>game to be announced since EA decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year" rel="nofollow">part ways with the organization</a> back in 2022, changing the name of its iconic&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>franchise to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

<p>In October last year, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">chose Konami as its new esports partner</a> following the split, although the governing body still hasn't chosen a flagship developer alongside whom to move forward with any kind of <i>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</i>competitor.</p>

<p>That has not, however, stopped FIFA from pursuing experiments in other areas, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-announces-4-world-cup-blockchain-games" rel="nofollow">unveiling of a range of Web3-related games</a> to coincide with the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Will the same thing happen for next year's tournament? We can only wait and see.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze have cancelled Project Baxter, the co-op live service Dungeons &amp; Dragons game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game-on-the-way-from-payday-devs">announced back in 2023</a>. Part of the development team have been transferred to other projects with Starbreeze, while the remainder get to "transition to new roles across the industry".</p>
<p>Starbreeze have told us little about Project Baxter over the years, beyond characterising it as an action-adventure that reflects their "lifetime commitment" to  Games-as-a-Service, and stating that it would support PC and console crossplay. They announced it with a couple of artworks - one depicting a close-cropped mage in a cape, the other some pointy roofs and pennants. The game surely would have built upon Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-payday-2">established</a>, albeit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-sales-significantly-lower-than-hoped-but-starbreeze-focused-on-long-term-success">recently eroded</a> reputation for co-op heisting. Now, however, Starbreeze bosses have decided that doubling down on Payday is the safer route forward.</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," comments CEO Adolf Kristjansson in <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">a release to investors</a>. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p>
<p>Around 44 people, spanning employees and contractors, are to lose their roles at Starbreeze in the course of writing off Baxter. The press release adds that "the discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026." For context, cash-flow positive means you have more money coming in over a given period, than going out - it's not the same as being overall profitable. Starbreeze <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">made a huge loss in their financial year 2024</a> after a catastrophic launch showing for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. </p><p>Kristjansson ends the release by thanking the Baxter team and D&amp;D license owners Wizards of the Coast, adding that work on Baxter "will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze". Maybe they should give the laid-off Baxter team members a Special Thanks credit in Payday 4, assuming that's next on the agenda. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

              <p>We’re closing in on Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s sales even taking place next week on October 7 and October 8. You can expect to see all sorts of deals covering a range of consumer tech, kitchen appliances, apparel, and more. Even though it’s not quite here yet, some deals have already started pouring in. Take a look over the the Fire HD 10. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">This Amazon tablet built for relaxation and fun normally is currently as much as 56% off.</a></p>
<p>There are four different versions of Amazon’s latest tablet. You can choose between having 32GB or 64GB of capacity as well as whether you want to put up with lock screen ads or not. If you don’t mind being bombarded with Alan Ritchson’s beefy shoulders and chiseled face promoting&nbsp;<em>Reacher&nbsp;</em>every time you reach for your tablet, you can get the Fire HD 10 for as low as $70. The 32GB is down to that from $140 while the 64GB is down to just $80 (originally $180). If&nbsp; you’d prefer not to have to look at ads on a device you own whenever you use it, you’re looking at a price point of $85 for the 32GB model and $95 for the 64GB model. If you end up going with the ad-enabled version but change your mind later, no worries. You can pay a one-time fee of $15 to have them removed after the fact.</p>

<p>As you can surmise from the name, this Fire HD 10 comes with a 10-inch HD 1080p screen (well, 10.1 inches to be precise). It makes for a terrific gift for the holidays for any friend, family member, or loved one.</p>
<h2>Bring Your Movies and Shows Anywhere</h2>
<p>This tablet supports a battery life of up to 13 hours. You’ll be able to binge an entire season or more of a TV show in one charge (at least a modern TV show from after we stopped making 24-episode long seasons).</p>



<p>The Fire HD 10 is both light and durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere easily. This tablet makes for a great travel companion as you’re able to download your favorite stuff to take along with you so you can watch movies or shows without having to pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>It’s equipped with a front-facing 5MP camera so you can keep in touch with family and friends using Zoom or any of the other video conferencing apps.</p>
<p>Choose between three different colors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">The Fire HD 10 is available in your choice of black, lilac, or ocean.</a></p>
