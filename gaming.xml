                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be one of the most technically demanding releases on the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. But according to CD Projekt Red's VP of Technology Charles Tremblay, bringing the game to the new console wasn't actually as much of a challenge as anticipated.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview, Tremblay discussed porting the ambitious open-world RPG, which began back in the summer of 2023 with a top-secret meeting with Nintendo to discuss its new console. At the early stages, he said a key aim was to "try to figure out if [running Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is] even possible."</p>

<p>The article notes that an initial struggle was that the Switch 2 has fewer computational cores available than even the last-gen consoles Cyberpunk 2077 had been developed for. But Nintendo's console also benefits from more RAM, as well as modern technologies including Nvidia's DLSS system, and faster read and write speeds with both its bespoke cartridges and the use of new microSD Express cards. When speaking of last-gen console limitations, Tremblay said, "The most difficult problem was the mechanical hard drive, which is one of the things that’s very important not to have.”</p><p>Having previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is the "best way to experience the game on the go,"</a> Tremblay also praised the other console's benefits: "I think the experience that we have, that is way different than other platforms, with the gyros, the Joy-Con, the mouse support. I think the whole package in general, I think it's quite good.”</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/" data-ref-id="1100-6530557">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition was announced as a Switch 2 launch title</a>, and it includes the Phantom Liberty expansion that is not available on last-gen platforms. The physical version will also come on the cartridge, unlike games from other third-party publishers that are releasing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/" data-ref-id="1100-6530576">Game-Key Cards</a>, which do not contain the game but are required to download and play.</p>

At the time, it said the games would get an update to increase resolution and frame rates on Switch. We later learned players can expect the games to run at 4K/60 FPS, and now, thanks to a new video uploaded on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/future-nintendo-and-switch-2-news-will-arrive-via-new-nintendo-today-app">the Nintendo Today news app</a>, we can see it in action.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Though we can’t embed the video here – it’s locked into the Nintendo Today! App – Wario64 on Bluesky posted a recording of the video that you can check out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lqn4deix3u2a">here</a>.</p><p>As you can see, it’s quite transformative to see Pokémon Scarlet and Violet running at 60 FPS, especially if you’re familiar with how they run on Switch. The Switch 2 update has seemingly taken these games, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/12/01/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-patch-arrives-with-bug-fixes-nintendo-apologizes-for-games">which often dip well below 30 FPS in busier areas of Paldea</a>, and given them the power to run at a seemingly stable 60 FPS. Despite the higher frame rate, the games still largely look the same, as you can’t rework an art style with increased resolution and 60 FPS gameplay.</p><p>Still, if you haven’t yet journeyed through Paldea, Switch 2 looks to be the best place to explore this region.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches this week, on Thursday, June 5.

It’s an incredibly useful ability that can often save your expeditions from failing.</p><p><strong>Sixth Sense won’t save you from death by status effects like Poison or Madness</strong>. The attack you’ll be resurrecting yourself from must be a lethal hit from an enemy. When the ability activates, you’re revived on the spot without losing any Runes.

While the ability only latches onto a single target, it can hit other enemies on the way there.

However, the Claw Shot will drop when hitting a shield, so you’ll have to run up to the enemy instead.</p><p>Claw Shot also synergizes well with Wylder’s Ultimate Art, Onslaught Stake.

The good news is that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">will be getting a free upgrade on Switch 2</a>, and as seen in some new gameplay footage, it looks like it'll be a much smoother experience overall. Previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-another-look-at-pokemon-scarlet-violets-switch-2-graphic-update/1100-6531933/">a single screenshot was posted on the Nintendo blog</a>, and the company mentioned that players will be able to see Pokemon from farther away.</p><p>New footage for the game was posted on the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lqn4deix3u2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), and it showed a higher frame rate, a densely packed overworld in the Paldean region, and colorful Terastallization for Pikachu. Overall, it looks like the game is running at or close to 60fps, but Nintendo hasn't confirmed yet the exact number of frames that the game is capable of reaching. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates">On its official Switch 2 upgrades page</a>, the company briefly mentions that the visuals have been optimized for Switch 2, and that the frame rate has been improved.</p><p>The other caveat here is that we also don't know how well the game holds up during intense moments of action or exploration, as that could result in a performance dip. While the preview clip isn't indicative of the whole game, it does still look promising, and hopefully, this upgrade can give Pokemon Scarlet and Violet a chance to shine. Even with its various technical flaws, it's still an impressive mainline Pokemon game with interesting gameplay mechanics, vast areas to explore, and a surprisingly touching story.</p><p>Pokemon fans can also look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> later this year. Ahead of a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/">Pokemon Presents livestream on July 22</a>, The Pokemon Company confirmed that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/">will launch for Switch and Switch 2 on October 16</a>.</p>

Dexterity is his highest stat, which makes him a good candidate for Curved Swords as their damage scales with that stat, but Ironeye wants to keep his distance from enemies. <strong>Any close combat weapons should be considered as backup weapons only</strong>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-duchess-old-pocketwatch-1851783119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-duchess-old-pocketwatch-1851783119">How To Unlock <em>Nightreign</em>’s Duchess</a></span></p><p>His decent Arcane stat can also be utilized with magic-infused close ranged weapons like Crystal Knife if you come across it. These kinds of weapons scale with Arcane and Intelligence. A quick knife can come in handy to fight back against enemies who try to get too close to you, giving you time to retreat and reposition yourself.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968">How To Unlock Revenant, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>’s Hidden Necromancer Character</a></span></p><p>Throughout your expeditions, you’ll want to <strong>prioritize any Stamina passive boosts that bosses drop after defeating them</strong>. Since Ironeye’s ability to constantly attack enemies with arrows depends on his Stamina, increasing it is always beneficial. Stamina management is crucial when playing as Ironeye. If you overextend yourself, you might not have enough Stamina to dodge out of the way if an enemy decides to attack you.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega released a rather interesting trailer for Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It features a brief overview of the beat-'em-up action that the series is known for, as well as a few surprising additions--including a new online multiplayer mode called Red Light Raid. What's most interesting though is the hotline number near the end of the trailer.</p><p>Dialing the number 1-888-YAKUZA0 (1-888-925-8920) will take you to a weird automated system with a variety of options. For instance, it'll ask if you'd like to talk to speak with fan favorite Kazuma Kiryu by pressing 0. Doing so will get you different messages explaining why he can't come to the phone; either he just isn't around or he's in a "bind" because of a murder. The same goes if you try to talk with Goro Majima. That said, the system will still allow you to leave a message for ... someone? There are other options as well. These include placing a takeout order from Smile Burger--a real burger chain that also exists in the game. It won't work of course.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2nhjslX9as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U2nhjslX9as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yakuza 0 was originally released for the PS3/PS4 in Japan back in 2015. Since then, it’s been successfully re-released on various consoles. This marks the first time, however, that Yakuza 0 has been given an upgrade of sorts. Players looking to relive the early days of Kiryu and Majima will be met with new never-before-released cutscenes. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio also added the Red Light Raid, a new four-player cooperative mode. Players will be able to choose from 60 different characters and team up with friends (or randoms via online matchmaking) in hopes of completing challenging missions.</p><p>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will seemingly be the best option for returning fans and newcomers alike. The new cutscenes will offer a deeper look into the lives of its protagonists while the Red Light Raid could be an exciting alternative to the game’s lengthy campaign. For those worried about how much it’ll cost in comparison to other Switch exclusives, don’t: Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will retail for $50 when it releases alongside the Switch 2 on June 5.</p>

		<p>The first week of June is a big week for <em>Remap</em>, between quietly hoping that everyone wants us to keep doing this, while also preparing to head to Los Angeles for several long days and nights. I'm doing my best to avoid thinking about attending a wedding on Saturday, one likely to end late at night, before waking up ass early to catch a flight to Los Angeles. I can't even check into my hotel by the time I land, but will have to immediately scoot over for an appointment. SGF is always an odd event, because it's not always clear how many interviews I can book, but I'm sure I'll come away with something for y'all. And I know I do this sappy thing every year, but thank you for supporting us and getting us this far. I hope it's just one of many anniversaries to come.</p><p>-pk, who recommends that you double check your <em>Remap</em> membership to make sure the correct credit card is being charged</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – I learned about Rob buying a house the same way you learned about Rob buying a house: live on last week's Remap Radio. But I get it. Buying a house is often full of disappointments, especially these days, because there are a million reasons for it to fall apart. Even Rob is hardly over the finish line here. Literally as I'm typing this he's at an inspection for the house. That stuff is scary!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Remap's 2nd Anniversary</em> – Come join as we spend a day streaming  to celebrate making this adventure last two years! It feels like just yesterday that I learned I'd accidentally been laid off because an executive misread an organizational chart, but here we are, folks. We'll start in the morning and go until sometime late in the afternoon/early evening.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – One of the first lines in Rob's opening to me this week is "let’s see how far we get in this before this turns out to be about aging or the Chicago Bears."</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – I'm heading to a all-encompassing family wedding this weekend, before heading to Los Angeles for a few days to cover Summer Game Fest, but we'll be together for Remap Radio before all that.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Summer Game Fest</em> – I'll be attending wedding festivities when this is all happening. (If I'm lucky enough to have a spare moment, I'll pop in!) But you can expect Rob and Chia, at least, to hold things down for Keighley's event.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

                <p>For the last couple of years, one of the go-to options for Xbox Series X|S users looking to expand the storage capacity of their console has been the Expansion Cards sold by Seagate. It looks like the company has a new 4TB memory card on the way, but don't expect it to be cheap. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Seagate+Releases+4TB+Xbox+Expansion+Card+And+It%27s+Very+Expensive&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6531989&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FEEV072&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fseagate-releases-4tb-xbox-expansion-card-and-its-very-expensive%2F1100-6531989%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy did have a listing up for it</a>--possibly too early, since it was quickly taken down--with a price of $430. Seagate hasn't officially confirmed the new Expansion Card yet, but with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Showcase scheduled for June 8</a>, we wouldn't be too surprised to see it formally revealed during the livestream.</p><p>Seagate usually sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB Expansion Cards</a>--the 512GB Expansion Cards seem to have been discontinued for a while now--and like its predecessors, the 4TB Expansion Card is a plug-and-play solution to upgrading your console storage. All you have to do is insert it into the dedicated port at the rear of your Xbox, and you're good to go.</p><h3>Seagate Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $220 (<del>$360</del>)</li></ul><h3>Western Digital Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a> -- $96</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $150</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $250</li></ul><p>Even better, the Expansion Cards are compatible with Xbox's Velocity architecture--so you're still getting lightning-fast load times with your games--and if you have multiple consoles, you can easily transfer data over using this little drive.</p><p>The nice thing about these Expansion Cards is that you're getting <em>most </em>of the listed storage on the box. For example, the 1TB Seagate Expansion Card gives you 920GB of usable space to install games on, and in comparison, a 1TB Xbox Series X console only gives you 802GB of space to work with, as some of it has to be set aside for the system's OS. While we're not certain how much usable space you'll get with the 4TB Expansion Card, it should still be a lot.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Seagate has competition in this space from Western Digital. The company launched its C50 Expansion Card back in 2023, and it offers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB models</a>. Prices have come down substantially since these were first released, as the WD Black 2TB Expansion Card originally sold for $400, but it now retails for $250.</p>

            <p>
Giant Skull, the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-3">God of War 3</a> game director Stig Asmussen last year, has signed a deal to create a new single-player action-adventure set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
</p>
<p>
Asmussen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-and-survivor-director-stig-asmussen-is-leaving-ea">announced his departure from Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment</a> back in 2023, when it was said he was waving goodbye in order to "pursue other adventures". Seven months later and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-director-stig-asmussen-opens-new-triple-a-studio-giant-skull">Giant Skull was unveiled to the public</a> with the goal of "building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds".
</p>
<p>
And the first of those worlds, it now transpires, will be a familiar one to RPG fans; Wizards of the Coast has announced it's signed a deal with Giant Skull to create an "all-new, single-player action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons". Details are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but we do know it's in development for PC and console using Unreal Engine 5, with more information promised "at a later date".
</p>
<p>
"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace."
</p>
<p>
Giant Skull's new game is just one of a number of Dungeons &amp; Dragons titles confirmed to be in development over the last few years. Payday developer Starbreeze, for instance, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a co-op live-service game</a> currently expected to release in 2026, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> studio Game Loft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">developing a co-op adventure built around "real-time survival and action"</a>. And then there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-triple-a-unreal-engine-5-game-in-development">triple-A Unreal Engine 5 project from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios</a>, first announced back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
It's a busy time in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, then, and amid all this, Wizards of the Coast's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">search for a new studio to take on the Baldur's Gate series</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">developer Larian's departure</a> seemingly continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/newest-edition-of-warhammer-horus-heresy-introduces-advanced-characteristics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced big changes for the newest edition of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy. This new edition, set in dark ages of the grimdark sci-fi world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, will be introducing new advanced characteristics to all of its units.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/fstxtjge/rules-in-the-age-of-darkness-how-do-advanced-characteristics-work/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop stated that all units in <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> will be getting an expanded statline. That statline will contain three new Advanced Characteristics: Cool, Willpower, Intelligence, and Leadership. These stats may be familiar to those who played the original <em>Rogue Trader</em> back in the day or have played the recent edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/necromunda-hive-secundus-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Necromunda</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-advanced-characteristics-statsheet.jpg?itok=q8gXOkpy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-advanced-characteristics-statsheet.jpg?itok=3cSPszby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>How these advanced characteristics work in <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> is simple. When called upon to make a check, the player rolls two dice. If the result is equal to or lower than the score, the unit is fine. If the result is higher, the unit suffers a penalty&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cool represents how the unit is calm under pressure. Intelligence refers to the unit interacting with technology. Willpower is used for manifesting or resisting psychic attacks. Lastly, Leadership represents the unit's receptiveness to orders. It is also used to determine rallied or panicking units.</p>

<p>There is some nuance to these new advanced characteristics. When these tests are made against a group of units, the unit with lowest score is used. The exceptions to this rule are Sergeants, who can make the test on behalf of their unit, and Commanders which can lend their stats to any ability check.</p>

<p>The post includes a look at the revised statlines for some <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> units. It shows certain tactical squad units having advanced characteristics around 7-8. Given the median of rolling 2d6 is around 7, these units are on a razor's edge.</p>

<p>By comparison, named units like the Space Marine Primarch Vulkan have advanced statistics exceeding 10. Unless there are some penalties to dice rolls, they'll be fine.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there is no concrete release date for the newest edition of <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em>.</p>

In particular the main city, Mesagoza, looks a lot better in the brief glimpse we get, and being able to see more Pokémon from farther away helps the world look a touch less empty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, at just half a minute of official, curated footage, it's not really possible to say how this impacts the experience holistically. In our review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet at launch, we noted that the fps was really just one issue of many. At the time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet were riddled with bugs</a> ranging from harmless visual goofiness to game crashing, and features such as raid battles seemed to be broken by design. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-the-indigo-disk-dlc-review">Multiple DLC releases</a> didn't alleviate most of those issues, either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see how much of a difference a Nintendo Switch 2 makes to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet when the upgrade patch releases on June 5 alongside the console.

Founded last year following Asmussen's departure from Respawn Entertainment, the Los Angeles-based Giant Skull was previously announced as making a new AAA single-player game built using Unreal Engine 5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen said in a statement today. "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of Giant Skull's project adds to a portfolio of games set to be published by Wizards of the Coast over the coming years, after the hugely-successful Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian, another D&amp;D game, helped raised the profile of the franchise globally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another D&amp;D action adventure game is already in development at Invoke Studios, the team behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance. Wizards of the Coast is also set to publish Exodus, the promising-looking sci-fi RPG from Archetype Entertainment, a developer founded by a collection of former Mass Effect veterans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Baldur's Gate series, it's expected that another game will eventually materialise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">though not from Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian, which has now moved on to something new</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-elden-right-nightreign-player-got-their-solo-nightlord-clears-in-before-the-nerf-heres-how<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> Patch 1.01.1 is live now, taking aim at the single-player experience to hopefully ease up the difficulty on those trying to clear the new FromSoftware game by themselves. One player, however, decided not to wait, and cleared every Nightlord solo before the patch made anything easier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Single-player difficulty in Elden Ring Nightreign has been one of the new game's hot topics, post-launch. Players have expressed frustration over how difficult running the game solo compared to trios has felt. Here's a bit of what our Elden Ring Nightreign review here at IGN had to say about it:</p><blockquote>"None of this is to say that solo play is outright impossible, and I <em>have</em> had a few successful runs on my own. Just that the balancing of solo play feels like a job half finished, and as a result, the frustration of playing alone wasn’t worth the triumph for me to have any desire to play more without a squad."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this built up to Bandai Namco and FromSoftware announcing a patch, arriving today, that took aim at easing the burden of solo players. For many, this might be a welcome relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the r/Nightreign subreddit, though, user "Valseran" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/managed_to_solo_all_nightlords_before_the_nerf/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted evidence of their solo clears</a> of each Nightlord, from the game's starting expedition to its final boss. Their reasoning? "Wanted to rush them down before the nerf."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's certainly an achievement. I'd heard tell of other players clearing big chunks of the game solo, and some, like YouTuber Ongbal, have been posting their solo victories against specific Nightreign bosses. Still, Valseran's effort to clear everything they could before the patch closed in is both impressive and fitting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the clear times on the right-hand side, showing them advancing steadily and clearing bosses in the days ahead of the update, like they're outrunning the impending storm of the patch. These bragging rights were earned largely by Ironeye wins it seems, with the Duchess and Executor characters making cameo appearances early on. Thankfully, we don't have to intuit too much from just one screenshot alone, as Valseran went into further detail about their victory within the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Don't worry too much about getting a good bow so much as stacking weapon passives in your other slots," said Valseran, when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/comment/mviszqy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about tips for Ironeye</a>. "Ranged dmg, dmg while Two-handing, and dmg while at full health can all stack and really cause your damage output to get absurd. Any purple quality bow will shine with some decent passives. Also his dash ability is great dmg output but i tend to save it as a dodge when i know an attack thats difficult to roll is on the way, I tend to use his Art for the same reason against bosses, more for the invulnerability than the damage."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Valseran primarily ran Ironeye, the ranged archer among the Nightfarers, they did say they prefer melee on some bosses, and even ran melee weapons <em>as </em>Ironeye on a few. Some bosses, though, are "just a nightmare solo" without ranged attacks, according to the lone wolf archer. They also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/comment/mvjcusa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rank the final boss as the hardest</a>, but say they died to the centaur boss (Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow) the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extra lives also seem to be a big priority, which makes sense; without teammates to pick you up, you'd like to have a safety net or two. Valseran said they would prioritize acquiring the extra lives from merchants, and also some field bosses would also drop them depending on the expedition. "One of my boss fights i went in with 4 extra lives," said Valseran. "But at the very least, always get one early."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An extra life during boss fights is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1011-nerfs-solo-mode-difficulty-fixes-bugs-and-makes-more-balance-changes">one of the ways FromSoftware is handing solo players a helping hand with Patch 1.01.1</a>. The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat," which allows revival during a night boss battle once per night, has been added to solo expeditions, effectively handing players a free second life. Valseran did say they think the extra life will be "kinda substantial" in solo play. Since stacking them is already ideal for single-player, having a free one is a nice bonus.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the single-player Nightfarers might have an easier time with clearing some of the more challenging fights in Elden Ring Nightreign, at least one player has earned some significant bragging rights. For everyone else, Elden Ring Nightreign is out now, with a slightly easier burden to bear for the lone wolves, and waiting for more Nightfarers to attempt to clear its challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
