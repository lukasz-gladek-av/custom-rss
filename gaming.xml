<p>This week marks the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on the Switch 2, and it's packed with a <em>huge</em> cast of characters.</p>
<p>As part of the new Zelda Musou's recent launch, the voice actors of many of the characters have now officially revealed who they played. Fan site <a href="https://x.com/ZeldaUniverse/status/1986445762134155524">Zelda Universe</a> notes how there are a total of 34 English voice actors in this new entry.</p>
<p>This includes the return of Patricia Summersett as Zelda, and talent such as Matt Mercer (known for his role as Ganondorf). You may also recognise other voices like Joe Zieja, who also voiced Claude in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full credits list and below this are as many announcement messages as we could find. These attach the voices to each character in the game.</p>

<h3>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Voice Actors:</h3>





















<p>If you're still not sure whether or not to check out this game yet, be sure to take a look at our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

<p>In a showdown that lived up to its billing as the ‘Telecom War,’ T1emerged victorious over KT Rolster in the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Grand Final, held in Chengdu, China. The best-of-five series went the distance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/">as I predicted</a>, with T1 edging out KT Rolster 3 – 2 in one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>



<p>This marks history for T1, securing the third consecutive League of Legends World Championship title, pushing Faker ever deeper into the annals of League esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-t1-and-kt-rolster-secure-record-breaking-viewership">T1 and KT Rolster Secure Record-Breaking Viewership</h2>



<p>The matchup between T1 and KT Rolster wasn’t just a battle for the Summoner’s Cup; it was a clash of legacy. It was T1 attempting to further cement its place as the most remarkable esports organization in the world, and KT Rolster’s desire to make a name for itself by winning its first LoL Worlds trophy.</p>



<p>While T1 entered the finals as the defending champion, aiming for a three-peat, KT Rolster had reached the GF of Worlds for the first time after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">decimating Gen.G</a>.</p>



<p>The tournament shattered viewership records, with the final match drawing millions of fans worldwide. T1’s quarter-final against Anyone’s Legend peaked at a whopping 3.27 million viewers, which made up a massive chunk of the 90.3 million watch hours recorded across the entire event.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why League Worlds is considered the most valuable esports tournament in the world.</p>



<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok has had a stellar year thus far, but this latest win propels him even further into the record books. Alongside his squad, he’s cemented himself as the undisputed GOAT of esports.</p>



<p>With this win, T1 not only secures their fourth overall Worlds title but also becomes the first team with three consecutive wins, a record that might <strong>never be beaten </strong>for as long as League of Legends exists.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you enjoyed this year’s League of Legends World Championship grand final.</p>

<p>Last week, we checked out the wonderful Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS and, as expected, the western design won the day with a whopping 84%. Good effort Japan, but this one just ain't it.</p>
<p>This time, we're looking at <strong>Dragon Power</strong> for the NES. Released in 1988, this was a top-down adventure game not entirely unlike Zelda II, in which you would explore environments before shifting to a side-scrolling viewpoint when facing off against enemies. It's said to be based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West in which a kung-fu protagonist is on a quest to recover the Crystal Balls.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fjqlsrk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've got North America, Europe, and Japan all vying for the prize today, so let's get cracking!</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d388c84d7aea5"><a title="Dragon Power US" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d388c84d7aea5/dragon-power-us.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this is very typical of those early NES box art designs, right? We've got the protagonist in the bottom left sporting a pretty large foot with teeny, tiny twinkle toes, while the background is mostly covered by a menacing green dragon. Doesn't it look a little familiar, though...?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="765dbbe637db7"><a title="Dragon Ball JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765dbbe637db7/dragon-ball-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hahaaa, <em>yes</em>! Some of you might have already known, but Dragon Power in the US is actually a Dragon Ball game. Released in Japan as <strong>Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo</strong> and in Europe as <strong>Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon</strong>, the American design basically got rid of all references to the hit manga/anime series.</p>
<p>This cover art features the iconic Goku in the foreground with Bulma and Yamcha in the background, presumably either levitating or running atop the back of the dragon Shenron.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="80009f6568181"><a title="Dragon Ball EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80009f6568181/dragon-ball-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so Europe's design basically features the same artwork as Japan, but we've also got some character portraits in the bottom left, with everything surrounded by a pretty basic blue background. Japan and Europe also share the same art style for the title, and dare we say that North America's approach with this might be a tad better..?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Ghost of Yōtei foreshadows a dark period in Japanese history]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/09/how-ghost-of-yotei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-foreshadows-a-dark-period-in-japanese-history.1348057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After the stellar reception that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> received, you might have expected that the team at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> were ready to wade into the nation-spanning conflict that was the Sengoku Jidai. Instead, the developers chose a timeline and setting for Ghost of Yōtei that would skip the Warring States period, and it’s a choice that really worked to their advantage.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei transports players to Ezo, the northern island region of Japan which we now know as Hokkaido. Set three hundred years after the original game, the year is 1603: the same year that Tokugawa Ieyasu is appointed shogun, ushering in an era of peace and stability after centuries of infighting between powerful warlords. Dubbed the Edo period, this golden age in Japanese history would last for more than 250 years, prior to The Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the end to the isolationism that kept Western influences at bay that this brought.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLcksHR30UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In 1603, our protagonist, Atsu, returns to her homeland in the shadow of the towering Mount Yōtei. At this time in history, Ezo wasn’t formally a part of Japan, and existed as a wild frontier beyond the reach of the emerging Tokugawa shogunate. It’s been sixteen years since Atsu was last here. Sixteen years since she was left for dead after a band of ronin slew her family forcing her to flee south where she became a sword for hire, fighting in the peasant infantry that lost the Battle of Sekigahara.</p>
<p>Left unchallenged, the rogue samurai known as The Yōtei Six have now established themselves as a formidable faction in Ezo, exploiting the native people and crushing any who oppose them. That’s until Atsu shows up of course, vowing to hunt down the outlaws who slew her parents and brother. She’s not the only one who has these ronin in her crosshairs: among the rebellious cast of companions that accompany Atsu, there is also the Matsumae clan.</p>

<p>Descendants of the Takeda, one of the big players during the Sengoku period, the Matsumae were considered the northern gatekeepers of Japan, establishing a stronghold in southern Ezo. From here, they began to exert their influence by forging political alliances with the indigenous Ainu people, whose descendants had occupied the land for many centuries.</p>

<p>With their own language, societal structure, and deeply spiritual beliefs, there was always going to be a culture clash between the semi-nomadic Ainu and their Matsumae neighbours. In <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, players are presented with a thoughtful insight into Ainu life when Atsu visits the many kotans (villages) spread across Ezo, learning more about their way of life. From their rituals and crafts to their gathering-focused economy, every aspect of Ainu life is conducted in a way that harmonises with the natural world, which they believe is governed by spirits known as the Kamuy. During her time with the Ainu, Atsu tracks a band of thieves who turn out to be a family stealing clothes and food for their newborn. Instead of punishing them, the villagers welcome them into their egalitarian community with open arms. Atsu also rescues an orphaned bear cub which the kotan raises as their own, promising to later kill the animal in an “iomante” ritual, honouring the bear by releasing its divine spirit back to the kamuy world.</p>
<p>Not all Ainu practices are compatible with our own sensibilities, yet there’s a wholesome spirituality there – something that the growing number of southern settlers would soon exploit. Over time, the native peoples of Ezo would become more reliant on trade with the Matsumae, exchanging natural goods such as fish and furs for sake, tools, and cloth. Predictably, as their reliance on this trade deepened, the Matsumae took the opportunity to drive up prices, unfairly tipping the scales in what was once a mutually balanced relationship. Those colonising tendrils continued to unfurl and squeeze the Ainu when the mainlanders began to eye Ezo’s rich natural resources, competing with their fisheries, and descending on the region’s lucrative gold mines.</p>
<p>In Ghost of Yōtei, we don’t get to see the full extent of this exploitation, though it’s clear that many of the Ainu are concerned about losing their autonomy and way of life as the shadow of the shogunate spreads further across their ancestral lands. One interesting example of this comes early on in-game when the Matsumae employ Atsu to guard the construction of a bridge. She discovers that the seemingly peaceful Ainu are responsible, not a group of marauding bandits. Despite the progress that infrastructure such as roads and bridges will bring to Ezo, not all of its inhabitants are willing to let the samurai extend their foothold.</p>

<p>Even when the disparate Ainu tribes united, they ultimately couldn’t prevent the steady advance of their occupiers. The Matsumae didn’t relent in squeezing them further, even driving some tribes to the brink of starvation, until they had no other option but to revolt. In 1669 the Ainu chieftain, Shakushain, led an armed rebellion that initially succeeded in driving back the Matsumae, who were severely outnumbered even if they were more technologically advanced.</p>
<p>This rebellion threatened the shogunate’s rule over Ezo. In response, several neighbouring samurai clans swiftly attacked and snuffed out the resistance, executing Shakushain and accelerating the subjugation of the Ainu. Forced to sign a peace treaty, tribe leaders were truly powerless as the Matsumae freely established more trading posts, inflating prices and tightening their economic chokehold.</p>

<p>Much later, during the Meiji Restoration (which saw Japan return to imperial rule after dissolving the shogunate) Ezo would be formally annexed, thereafter known as Hokkaido. This was part of Japan’s modern movement towards shedding dogmatic isolationist policies and fully embracing industrialisation. Needless to say, this didn’t improve the Ainu’s standing in Japanese society. Adopting a similar approach to the United States, the native Ainu were forcibly expelled from their homeland to make way for settlers, with those who remained forced to assimilate and denied the right to speak their ancestral language.</p>
<p>Again, we only see the seeds of this travesty begin to take root in Ghost of Yōtei. But behind Atsu’s katana-waving quest for revenge there’s plenty of foreshadowing that makes the game’s setting far more interesting than another spin on the Sengoku Jidai. Much like its predecessor, the sequel hones in on a fascinating historical flashpoint where the setting becomes the main character, portraying the samurai as complex and nuanced instead of idly romanticising them.</p>

<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast has been on the market for several weeks, Techland has reorganized its developers and intends to get back on the Dying Light 2: Stay Human train. In a post on social media, franchise director Tymon Smektala asked the community what it would like to see prioritized in the coming months, suggesting that at least half a year of content is planned.</p>



<p>This was always on the cards, as Techland stressed that Dying Light: The Beast represented an important stopgap in the ongoing support of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service title that debuted in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-dying-light-2-stay-human">What’s Next for Dying Light 2: Stay Human?</h2>



<p>The post on social media published by Techland’s franchise director of Dying Light has exciting implications for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service, open-world zombie apocalypse title that dropped in 2022.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As The Beast was released we can now move more people to support DL2:SH as promised. What are the most important things we should handle? What kind of content/updates/fixes you’d expect right<br>now or in 3-6 months?</p>— Tymon Smektała (@smektalaTM) <a href="https://twitter.com/smektalaTM/status/1987249247402578122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a community-led decision, Techland has opted to have fans decide what comes next, with Smektala reaching out to the players to see what they’d like prioritized. Techland has always been focused on the community with Dying Light, and hosts a submissions function on the game’s themed website that users can lean on to make their requests and wishes heard.</p>



<p>The Dying Light series has plenty left in the tank. Following the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">a new era of sorts was established</a>, and the game’s ending directly links to future projects that can easily be predicted. With a universe that still has plenty to give, there’s no telling where the road will eventually take Dying Light.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-882-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-9.1348039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week comes to a close, and I’m hopeful that your NYT Connections streak has kept up for the duration. I’m also optimistic that I’ve <strong>helped you </strong>maintain that streak by providing you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions all week long. If you want more of that today, read on.</p>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections tips and solutions are waiting just below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #882:</p>



<ul>
<li>NOODLE</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>CRANIUM</li>



<li>MIRROR</li>



<li>PUFNSTUF</li>



<li>REFLECT</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>



<li>MUSE</li>



<li>COMPACT</li>



<li>LUNAR</li>



<li>NAIL FILE</li>



<li>THICK</li>



<li>DENSE</li>



<li>DELIBERATE</li>



<li>CRONUT</li>



<li>TWEEZERS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think beauty tools or grooming essentials you might stash in a makeup bag or bathroom drawer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These words all describe things that are tightly arranged, thickly clustered, or densely filled</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these verbs evokes contemplation, pondering, or mental wandering—perfect for a philosophical mood.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group blends real and invented terms that share a playful, oddball vibe—some are names, some are snacks, some are just fun to say.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 9.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-9-882">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 9 (#882)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRUSH, MIRROR, NAIL FILE, TWEEZERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMPACT, DENSE, THICK, TIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DELIBERATE, MUSE, NOODLE, REFLECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRANIUM, CRONUT, LUNAR, PUFNSTUF</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Refuses to Slow Down and Secures Another Peak Player Record]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-peak-player-count-secured/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-refuses-to-slow-down-and-secures-another-peak-player-record.1348036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to take the world by storm, this time generating a new all-time high peak player count record on Steam more than a week after release. It’s proving to be the most sensational title to hit the market in years, and everyone from casual gamers to hardcore extraction shooter fans is getting involved.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit 416,517 concurrent players, up from the recent high of 354,000. It’s indicative of something remarkable, as ten days into the game’s lifecycle, it’s bucking trends and continuing to soar.</p>







<p>In the numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/">the reviews</a>, and the ratings, ARC Raiders is the most popular extraction shooter ever made. The sentiment surrounding this game is enough to throw the likes of Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Delta Force out the window entirely.</p>



<p>People are soaking up every element of ARC Raiders, from the aesthetic that’s dripping in retro-futurism to the social mechanics that are making ARC Raiders a joy to explore.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hit-new-peak-player-count-broke-servers/">another all-time high</a> peak concurrent user count, which is rare considering the game has been out for <strong>ten days</strong>. In most cases, games start to inevitably ebb in terms of player count at this point, but ARC Raiders is <strong>evolving</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What’s more impressive is that it’s only getting better. Embark Studios has lined up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a roadmap of content</a> and upgrades that it’ll drip feed into ARC Raiders, and the team wants to support the ambitious extraction shooter for a whopping <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>



<p>Things could take a bit of a dip this coming week, as Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most prolific spearhead extraction shooter ever made, finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">hits a 1.0 release</a> and emerges on new platforms, namely Steam. If anything can poach players from ARC Raiders, it’ll be that, so it’ll be interesting to see what loyalty ARC players have stumped up in the short term.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Global Test Ride is currently taking place this weekend, and it looks like the game engine it's running on might have been uncovered.</p>
<p>It's Bandai Namco's new in-house engine SOL-AVES. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1or8w63/kirby_air_riders_appears_to_run_on_the_solaves/">some detective work</a>, the engine's logo has been spotted in the game demo's Intellectual Property Notices. We've taken a look ourselves and can confirm it's listed. The <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/sol-aves-79369433">trademark for this engine</a> was filed in "late 2024", but it's apparently been in the making since around 2019, and was <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-is-still-working-on-new-in-house-game-engine-update-reveals/">initially revealed in 2022</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytWA6pqBIEskk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Recruitment and training for the engine is supposedly ongoing, and its first major public test appears to be this new title by legendary game director Masahiro Sakurai. Below you can see new engineers testing it out. This new game engine has also previously <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.snar.jp/jobboard/detail.aspx?id=bew5uZn3nmm_5RVLIxMdPg">shown up on Bandai Namco's official website</a> in job listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco Studios develops its own in-house game engine. As part of their training, new engineers had the opportunity to try out our in-house developed game engine! During the training, after learning the basic operations, the participants created a simple game. The ease of use of the in-house game engine has been very well received."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, Bandai Namco has made use of video game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine for major releases.</p>

                <p>If you've received an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> quest called Power Out and aren't quite sure where you need to go to get it done, you've come to the right place. This may be one of the game's most basic quests, but as with many of its outings, the act of getting there and getting back out can be more challenging than anything. So, we'll share the exact location of the quest below so that you can take some of the guesswork out, allowing you to focus on making the magic happen.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Power Out, but you may potentially be making quite a trek to reach the quest location. It's not a bad idea to toss on a combat-focused augment with a good gun and shield, as well as plenty of ammo and healing items to ensure you're prepared to take on anyone standing in your way.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle Power Out, follow the steps below.</p><h2>How to complete the Power Out quest on Spaceport</h2><p>The first step to completing Power Out is to head all the way south on Spaceport to find the Electrical Substation. Depending on where you spawn on the map, this could be quite a trek, so while the area itself is pretty tame, don't be shocked to run into trouble on the way there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599087" data-ratio="0.55981595092025" data-width="1956" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599087"></a><figcaption>Electrical Substation location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599087-19a64cbf91d32-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you arrive, you'll be prompted to find signs of an engineer who has gone missing, which is very easy to find. Identify the electrical box below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599086-share_20251108_0712381.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4599086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599086-share_20251108_0712381.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4599086"></a><figcaption>Electrical box</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599086-share_20251108_0712381.jpeg"></figure><p>While looking at the electrical box, turn left and spot the engineer's bag a few steps away. Interact with it, take the item within, then return to the electrical box. Interact with the electrical box to place the item inside. Turn on the power to complete the quest.</p><p>With the quest complete, your next goal is to extract. Unfortunately, due to being so far south on the map, you're going to have to walk quite a way to get to an elevator. Your choices are the South Elevator to the northwest or the East Elevator to the northeast, so make sure you're reloaded and healed up, then set off. We'll be rooting for your survival.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">f</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">ull quest list</a>.</p>

Flickering Threat requires you to jump into the Dam Battlegrounds map and fix up a power generator, so don't think you're getting any time off today. And if you're feeling a little lost on how to complete this quest, we're here to help you out.</p><p>While you don't need to extract to complete Flickering Threat, <strong>you will need 4 Wires to repair the generator during the quest</strong>, so make sure to add those to your inventory or loot them from the Power Generation Complex while you're exploring. Without these in your inventory, the quest can not be progressed.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle Flickering Threat, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the Generator Hall</h2><p>The Generator Hall is located on the left side of the Power Generation Complex in the northern region of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a high-traffic location that is often filled with both ARC and raiders, so come prepared for a fight just in case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599078" data-ratio="0.56468906361687" data-width="1399" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599078"></a><figcaption>Generator Hall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599078-19a64cc0f7624-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you reach the Generator Hall, you'll be prompted to repair a generator. Here's to hoping you remembered to bring 4 Wires!</p><h2>How to repair the generator</h2><p>To repair the generator, head to the location on the map above and look for long openings in the ground. Use these to drop inside the Generator Hall. You can also get to this room via nearby doors and hallways, but dropping in saves a lot of time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599081-share_20251108_0115163.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4599081" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599081-share_20251108_0115163.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4599081"></a><figcaption>Repair the generator using 4 Wires.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4599081-share_20251108_0115163.jpeg"></figure><p>Once inside, stand between the two elevators and look at the end of the westernmost one to see a prompt to repair it using 4 Wires.

<p>Classic building and resource management gets cosy</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a fan of cosy-style games and don't mind some classic building and resource management sim action, you might be interested in the upcoming Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a>. This game originally made its console debut in October on the Xbox.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-game-from-wholesome-snack-2024-coming-to-nintendo-switch">announced during the 'Wholesome Snack 2024' presentation</a> last December, it seems it might finally have a release date. According to the official store page on Nintendo's website and eShop, it will launch next month on <strong>10th December 2025</strong> for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>This game is compatible with the Switch 2 and will apparently take up 1.8 GB on both Switch systems. Here's the official description, and you can see the original announcement trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play as Morgan, an aspiring engineer headed home to complete your family's dream project - a rocket ship! Finding home not quite how she left it, Morgan will need to research and build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to help the locals. From simple drills and furnaces to complex assemblers, cranes and miles of conveyor belts, you'll convert local resources into useful materials and bring industry back to sleepy St. Ambroise.</p>
<p>- Build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to solve puzzles and help the town<br>
- Get to know the locals, make lifelong friendships and become the heart of the community<br>
- Research and invent new machines, energy sources and mechanical friends<br>
- Discover a heartwarming story as Morgan, an aspiring engineer with high hopes for town!<br>
- Finally build your family's rocket ship!</p>
<p>Outside of smashing together crazy contraptions, you'll need to mine out resources, explore coasts, railyards, quarries and underground areas - each part of town has its own materials to inspire you! You'll need to complete challenges, incorporate electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, crafting, automate through robotics, and loads more to ensure St. Ambroise returns to its former glory. Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?</p>
<p><em>"Little Rocket Lab is a classic building and resource management sim, set in a cozy village filled with NPCs who want to help... and sometimes hinder. With friendships to rekindle, puzzles to solve and a huge world to explore, everything is in place to make this experience a blast from start to finish."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over on Steam, this title has received "Very Positive" user reviews, so if you're into this kind of game - it might be worth keeping tabs on.</p>

<p>Is Crash finally back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56093ff1da2ad"><a title="Crash Team Racing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56093ff1da2ad/crash-team-racing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Crash Bandicoot hasn't been sighted for a while now, but Crash fans think they might have spotted something that could be tied to a new game project or at least a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>This development comes from the <a href="https://x.com/BeenoxTeam">official Beenox social media account</a>. Beenox, in case you need a refresher, is the same team that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> and has also helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/1op4zhp/beenox_changed_his_banner_and_crash_appears_twice/">uploaded a banner featuring Crash in a kart</a> and then removed it shortly after. What's interesting about this is it appears to be based on Crash's character model from the fourth outing - a title that was released well after the most recent racing game.</p>

<p>So, that's it for now, but if there are any other significant updates or developments here, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this happens to follow a rumour in October about Crash Bandicoot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-sonic-prime-studio-reportedly-working-on-crash-bandicoot-animation-for-netflix">potentially getting his own animation on Netflix</a>. If you missed it, it's claimed WildBrain Studios - the same team behind Sonic Prime (and also helping out with the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series on Netflix) is behind it. 2026 will also mark Crash's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>For now, the current stories circulating about Crash Bandicoot are just rumours - so nothing has been officially confirmed or announced, and there's no guarantee this discovery will necessarily lead to a new project, reveal or update.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-slashes-this-1500w-power-station-to-peanuts-7-outlets-save-you-during-winter-blackouts-2000642286</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-slashes-this-1500w-power-station-to-peanuts-7-outlets-save-you-during-winter-blackouts.1347964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms have a way of knocking out power at the worst possible times but the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) portable power station</strong> offers a solid solution to keep your essentials running when the grid goes dark. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/">Amazon has slashed the price from $899 to $449</a>, which makes this one of the best times to grab reliable backup power without emptying your wallet. You’ll also get a <strong>free 3-port 103W fast charger as a bonus</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Delivers Power When You Need It Most</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 houses a 1<strong>,070Wh LiFePO4 battery within its compact frame, weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. This capacity translates to real-world performance that matters during an outage: running a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 hours to preserve your groceries, powering a space heater for about 1.5 hours to stay warm, or keeping your internet router and laptop running for an entire day to work from home. Most household appliances are handled easily with its<strong> continuous output of 1,500W, while the 3,000W surge capacity</strong> is there when devices like refrigerators need that initial power boost to start.</p>
<p>The LFP battery chemistry separates this model from the more affordable options: Typical lithium-ion batteries do not last long, but this LiFePO4 arrangement retains <strong>upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles</strong>. That kind of longevity equates to well over a decade of service, making that $449 price tag seem much more reasonable if you calculate it on a cost-per-year-of-ownership basis. This battery technology is also less susceptible to temperature extremes than a standard lithium-ion cell.</p>



<p>Getting from empty to full in just one hour through the emergency charging mode via the Jackery app changes how you can use this power station. If you hear about an incoming storm, you can top it off quickly instead of waiting overnight. The default 1.7-hour charging mode balances speed with battery health for everyday use, which helps explain that 10-year lifespan claim. <strong>ChargeShield 2.0 technology automatically regulates voltage and temperature</strong>, and safeguards both the power station and whatever devices you plug into it.</p>



<p>Port selection matters when you try to keep multiple devices alive during an outage: The <strong>Explorer 1000 has three AC outlets for standard plugs, two USB-C that provide up to 100W for fast charging laptops and tablets, one USB-A for older devices, and a DC car port for 12V equipment</strong>. This means not having to choose between charging your phone and powering your CPAP machine.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable handle and relatively light weight</strong> make this truly portable despite its capacity. You can take it down to your basement during bad weather, toss it in the back of your truck for that weekend camping trip, or bring it to an outdoor concert where your band requires power for amps and mixers. Lighting from built-in LED lights helps navigate through darkened homes during nighttime power outages, with no fumbling for flashlights in the dark.</p>
<p>At $449, you’re getting backup power that costs less than a typical emergency generator while offering more flexibility and cleaner energy. Gas generators require fuel storage, regular maintenance, and produce fumes that make indoor use impossible. The deal is a massive 50% discount from the regular $899 price (and you get a free fast charger as well) which makes this an all-time low worth grabbing before winter weather arrives in full force.</p>

            <p>
MiHoYo appear to be eternally busy. After printing copious amounts of money with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, they are continuing to do so with future releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-devs-next-game-looks-so-much-like-animal-crossing-im-almost-not-sure-why-it-exists">Petit Planet</a> (or Not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>) and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> (Not Pokemon). Now, it turns out, they're also working on an MMO, seemingly codenamed Genesis, that seemingly in some capacity incorporates AI, it's just unclear what kind.
</p>
<p>
As spotted over on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">ResetEra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">Eurogamer</a>), miHoYo shared a very short kind of teaser video acting as a sort of recruitment post for said MMO that's described as a "fantasy realism open world game." Details are quite slim, unsurprisingly, but here are the ones of note. It'll be made in Unreal Engine 5, it'll have PvP, "Intellectual NPC," and the two potentially controversial bits, an "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System," and "All-Terrain Battle AI."
</p>

<p>
A few points worth mentioning here. Something could have been lost in translation here, so it might not be talking about the bad kind of AI you and I hate. AI as a term has obviously been used to describe NPC behaviours for a long time too, so it could just be that. But miHoYo are no strangers to AI usage, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">they've even done so in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and I'm not sure what an AI stimulated eco system could mean other than the bad kind. So, take all of this cautiously and skeptically until there's more details.
</p><p>
Judging from the very short teaser that exists, whatever Genesis ends up being like, it'll probably be a lot less anime (as vague a descriptor as that is) than games like Genshin Impact. A potential divergence for the company that relies on people getting much too invested in jiggly, overly cute women. Well, and the occasional man these days too. Diversity win!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> turns five years old next week, and ahead of that its developer Tom Sala has put in the work for a pretty big update. Update undersells it a touch I think, because it's being billed as a full-on remaster, complete with a touched up look, and plenty of mechanical changes. So, let's detail those details!
</p>
<p>
For one, landing sounds like it should be a lot easier, as you can land just by flying close to a perch without having to press a button. Speaking of buttons, the dash and acrobatics have been changed to have separate buttons and controls. Collision accuracy has been improved now too, with tighter movement to boot.

<p>
It's not just mechanics that have been updated, your warbird itself is looking fresher with individual feathers and more detail. Its head stays leveled when turning "(as birds of prey do)," and there are now wing flexing and steering animations. Landing and diving animations have been improved too, and player bird collision avoidance should be less annoying. I'm always striving to be less annoying! There's a long list of quality of life improvements, control tweaks, visual changes, bug fixes, and even just outright new stuff that you can check out in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/591787131954790437?l=english">Steam post</a>.
</p><p>
Talking in more depth in an earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/506217467911078264?l=english">Steam post</a> about the remaster - which is out now and completely free for those that own the game, and is included if you haven't bought it yet - Sala was quite open about the base game's launch. "Every release is horror, but this one was pretty bad by every account," Sala wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"And let's be honest the PC launch suffered in many ways, some my own mistakes biting me, some consequences of releasing an indie console launch title in a week where both Xbox and Playstation were launching their next gen." Sala went on to explain how this is his chance at "doing it better," and better reflecting a game that's deeply personal to him, spending his free time working on this remaster whenever he could. As always, making games is hard! Nice work.
</p>
<p>
If you don't own The Falconeer, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135260/The_Falconeer_Revolution_Remaster/">try out it and its new remaster on Steam right now</a> completely for free until November 10th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 may be coming to Xbox Game Pass. While not confirmed, a fan found an official advertisement showing the game off.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to be excited about if you’re a Call of Duty fan right now. The biggest, of course, is the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, the next big game in the franchise. With constant updates to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it’s a good time to be a fan. Fortunately, many titles in the series are available on Game Pass, both Xbox and PC. Well, a new Xbox advertisement may have spoiled one of the next entries to come to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-game-pass-possibly-getting-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-soon">Xbox Game Pass Possibly Getting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Soon</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TypicalNarr</a>, who discovered a simple Xbox Game Pass Premium ad on their console. In it, it shows many of the games on the service like Sea of Thieves and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-adds-over-90-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. However, one game caught the user’s eye that isn’t on there: the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 from 2009.&nbsp;As of writing, the game has never been on Game Pass, so the usage of the game’s cover art is a bit suspicious.</p>



<p>While it does appear official, take it with a grain of salt. One user on Reddit mentioned that 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, part of the reboot trilogy, is on the service, so perhaps it was a mix-up. Still, fans have been hoping for classic Call of Duty titles to come to Game Pass. It’s long been rumored that titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-world-at-war-and-infinite-warfare-appear-with-included-with-game-pass-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World at War</a> would drop on the subscription service with Activision’s purchase by Xbox. Hopefully, if true, more games like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 can come out for newer fans to try out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Modern Warfare 2 going to Game Pass? Which older Call of Duty games do you want to see on the service? World at War? Black Ops? More Modern Warfare? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

Slightly serious one here folks! The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, one of this year's best received games, is asking for some help for one of their lead playtesters, Matthew "Iggy" Kowalski. As shared on Bluesky, Iggy has polycystic kidney disease, leaving him with only a few months to find a living kidney donor.
</p>
<p>
Developer Dogubomb wrote on Bluesky that "Iggy was an invaluable tester and contributed so much to the project. He was absolutely brilliant in the game and came up with so many original strategies we had never considered. Please help us spread the word and as we help find him a living kidney donor."
</p>

</span></p><p>
Iggy lays his situation out very plainly on his <a href="https://www.iggyland.org/">personal website</a>: "I have a disease that requires a living kidney donor. There are no other viable options for me. I have only a few months before I will need to have this surgery before getting extremely sick and dying." He explains that his disease causes his kidneys to "have cysts grow all over them and make them massive in size. As they do so, the kidneys grow less and less in function. Think like the chest buster in Alien, except it’s not an alien baby and we don’t anticipate it coming to theatres this fall."
</p><p>
I share this with you because quite frankly, if you have a kidney you don't need, it would be nice if you could help out a dev in need! Iggy even clarifies that you don't need to be a perfect match, as some collaboration can be done with other donors to find the best-fit. There's more details on Iggy's website, so tell a friend even if you can't do it yourself!

			<p>Yesterday was N7 Day, the yearly franchise appreciation day that Mass Effect developer BioWare has held every November 7 since 2012. In the game, N7 is a vocational code in the Systems Alliance military, where the N designates special forces and the 7 refers to the highest level of proficiency, thus referring to the main character, Shepard, and his strike team.</p>



<p>N7 Day 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivered confirmation that the studio, despite the layoffs, is still working on the next Mass Effect game</a>. In the blog post, long-time Executive Producer Mike Gamble inserted a secret message that the fans eventually decoded, revealing a new artwork from the upcoming game. The art depicts Krogan characters and features the subtitle 'Civil War'. This hints at one of the themes we may discover in the game: a major division within the Krogan race between at least two factions. </p>



<p>Those who have played previous Mass Effect games are certainly familiar with the Krogan, a species of large, reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka. They famously survived despite the harsh environment of their home world, only to destroy it themselves in a nuclear war. The survivors split into tribes that were constantly at war with one another. Indeed, they are considered a warrior race, but some of them do not necessarily wish to perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of fighting that has characterized the Krogans. This may be the primary source of the disagreement, though it's only speculation at this point, of course.</p>



<p>The next Mass Effect is at least three to four years away, and fans may have to make do with just art teasers in the near future. There is, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon TV series in development</a>, and BioWare confirmed that it will be an original story (written by Daniel Casey and directed by Doug Jung) set after the original Mass Effect trilogy. We'll keep you updated once there are casting news on the show.</p>

            <p>
While there is a notable enough sentiment that old games are worse because they are old, so should therefore be either let to rot or to be remade so that they are "better," I think this argument goes out the window when you look at something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a>. That thing came out in 2022! And it launched on PS2 first! Yet here it is more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-23-years-on-final-fantasy-11-is-still-getting-updates-with-one-coming-thatll-let-you-change-how-your-character-looks">still getting updates</a>, and now, potentially, an entire new zone.
</p>
<p>
This week saw a new Freshly Picked Vana'diel, a semi-regularly held livestream from the Final Fantasy 11 team similar in nature to Final Fantasy 14's Letter from the Producer streams that details upcoming additions or changes, that sort of thing. It was held in Japanese, which I don't speak, but luckily some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/1oqvpee/freshly_picked_future_plans/">Redditors</a> who do explained that the team is seemingly preparing for the ability to make new areas.

<p>
As mentioned, this was originally a PS2 game, the PC release came a short while after, and that fact also appears to be a problem for the FF11 team. Everything is still made using the original PS2 dev kits, which obviously will be massively outdated by this point. Judging from some of the comments, on-stream the team discussed that they're working on plans in the event that these dev kits don't work anymore so that they can make new equipment still, and in particular start making new areas again.
</p><p>
I may not have spent any time with Final Fantasy 11 myself, but it really can't be understated how valuable it is that this 23 year old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is still going, let alone the fact it's still getting new content. These spaces become second homes (or even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/second-life">Second Life</a>) for some people, and sure, we should strive to not be too beholden to our computers, but they are still realms of virtual existence that deserve to be maintained. A new area would be pretty significant as there hasn't been a big new one since its 2015 expansion Seekers of Adoulin. Fingers crossed for those of you still playing!

            <p>Just days after a new rating on the American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) hinted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esrb-rating-confirms-silent-hill-2-remake-is-finally-on-the-way-to-xbox-consoles">Silent Hill 2 Remake was finally on its way to Xbox</a>, a page that briefly popped up on the Microsoft Store has all but confirmed it.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox">True Achievements</a>, the page - which has since been removed - didn't list a release date, but after rummaging around in the backend, the site believes the remake will launch on 21st November.</p>

<p>Much like the PC and PS5 versions, players upgrading to the deluxe edition can secure a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and the Pyramid Head pizza box skin, along with a mysterious "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> bundle".</p>
<p>The game is described as optimised for Xbox Series X/S, but the page does not suggest it'll be playable as a Play Anywhere title.</p>

The voice actor behind Remake's Maria <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-actor-confirms-weve-not-recorded-anything-for-born-from-a-wish-dlc">recently confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content, either</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves." It's sold about 2.5 million copies, taking sales for the 20+ year old franchise to 10 million.</p>

            <p>
I know, I know, change is difficult isn't it? It upset me just the other day that YouTube has changed videos so that they have rounded corners instead of being perfectly rectangular. It's sacrilegious! A feeling I will continue to have until I ultimately forget about it because life moves on to the next grievance. Still, subtle changes like that can often set some kind of internal alarm bells off, something you might have been experiencing with store pages on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> looking a bit… wider.
</p>
<p>
That is because they are, in fact, wider! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> have said as such somewhere along the line, and the update arrived in the digital storefront yesterday, with a nifty little <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528">blog post</a> explaining and showing what the changes actually are. Essentially, store pages for games and the few bits that aren't games have been widened from 940 pixels to 1200 pixels. Doesn't sound like much, but seeing it side by side, there's a surprising amount of space that's been added.
</p>
<p>
That's not the only difference, though. Images that show up in the carousel now have a higher resolution, and there's a couple new viewing modes to go along with that too; theater mode plasters images and videos across most of the screen, and full-screen mode is exactly what it sounds like. Devs will also have more control over the about sections of their games, again with bigger and higher-quality images, and more flexible formatting. You might also notice that store pages' background images pop a bit more too, as more colour and texture will come through.
</p>
<p>
This widening of Steam applies to other aspects of the store too, like search results and recommendation pages, with some general size adjustments for individual tags, charts, and the news hub. Apparently the homepage will be subject to a widening in the "near future too." Also, you shouldn't need to worry about pages being too wide if you're using a narrow browser or client, because Valve even tested it on some old iPod a team member "had laying around." Classic Valve.

            <p>Fans believe they've uncovered a possible timeframe for when we may finally learn about Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if, admittedly, no specific confirmation - that Valve is working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailed datamined assets</a>, backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved, we were then told the new Half-Life project, codenamed HLX, was not just in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests">but was now "playable, end-to-end"</a>.</p>

<p>And now, Redditor sameseksure believes they've worked out when an announcement may be coming simply by analysing the Steam store's top banner.</p>
<p>"Valve uses the top banner on the front page of the Steam Store whenever they want to promote a Steam Sale, Steam Event, or new products like games or hardware," the user reasoned. "Whatever's on the front page of Steam gets a HUGE amount of exposure. They put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> on the front page banner <a href="https://youtu.be/yLr2z1dTlec?si=oME1NNk_aBrT35Em&amp;t=30">immediately after the announcement back in 2019</a>, as well as the Valve Index when it was announced. When there's a Steam Sale or Event, it takes up the top banner <strong>for the whole duration of those events</strong> (Summer Sale, Next Fest, etc.).</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1oqn6x4/18_november/">18 November</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sameseksure/">u/sameseksure</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/">HalfLife</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"<strong>Therefore, they will not announce anything at the same time as major Steam Events are happening</strong>, as they would be cannibalising their own sales," they added (emphasis theirs). "They'd rather reschedule stuff to ensure they're not cannibalising themselves."</p>
<p>They then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fsys18qwgj5zf1.png">linked to a list of scheduled Steam events</a> for the rest of the year, pointing out an unusually large gap between 18th November and 8th December.</p>
<p>"This could mean that Valve plans to announce Half-Life 3 (or Deckard, or both) on 18 November, and made sure no other Steam Events were happening at that time," they added.</p>
<p>A stretch? Maybe. But it's one of the most plausible explanations yet, not least because Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770004">moved its Autumn Sale ahead by two months to September, even though it usually happens in November</a>, and in the Autumn Sale announcement, Steam teased: "'Is Steam crazy? They’re two months ahead of schedule!' Yes, we are crazy, and yes we are earlier than usual, <strong>but also that’s intentional'</strong>" (again, poster's own emphasis).</p>
<p>"So if it's happening in November, it'll be 18/19/20 November," the Redditor concluded (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/half-life-3-trailer-november-18-theory/">TheGamer</a>). "Or never."</p>
<p>All this also reinforces Valve insider Tyler McVicker's claim that the eagerly anticipated sequel could release before the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The rationale has convinced even the most sceptical of Half-Life fans, generating thousands of upvotes from fans impressed by the caculation, and desperating hoping they're right. Time will tell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-comes-under-fire-for-roobet-gambling-streams.1347820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, OpTic’s most prolific creators, alongside the likes of Nadeshot, have come under intense scrutiny after jumping on board with Roobet, a crypto-based online casino. In streams featuring Scump and H3CZ, followers have been subjected to the OpTic team playing slots and games on Roobet, also taking their gambling activities to Kick.com.</p>



<p>It was just days ago that H3CZ and Scump revealed they’d secured a bag in an all-new Roobert partnership that predicated them setting up and hosting gambling livestream events, but fans are <strong>not happy</strong> and are venting on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-scump-gambling-on-stream">Why is Scump Gambling on Stream?</h2>



<p>It wouldn’t be <strong>as bad</strong> for some, but many viewers have commented on how Scump, in particular, doesn’t appear to be genuine during his gambling streams and is not playing his part properly. He and H3CZ have started streaming certain slots on Roobet, hosting broadcasts that many assume are worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Roobet has previously partnered with other celebrities, so this isn’t new, but many are on the side of this being irresponsible by Scump, whose audience is mostly impressionable youngsters.</p>



<p>Nadeshot has also spent a few weeks dabbling in the gambling game, flying out to Mexico to circumvent laws in the United States that prohibit some gambling activity and broadcasting from there instead. He faced backlash after jetting out to Mexico to host gambling streams while 100 Thieves, the organization he founded, held layoffs.</p>



<p>It has been argued that OpTic’s endorsement of a gambling platform like Roobet sends a troubling message to reviews, especially considering the brand’s legacy and influence in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> esports space. It’s a well-known fact that <strong>betting </strong>makes up a huge portion of esports revenue, but slots are a different thing entirely.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Birdman was quick to address a spot of irony, suggesting that Pred was once removed from OpTic’s roster for having a prolific gambling problem:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did optic kick pred off the team just for them to get sponsored by roobet they tarnished that guys pr for nothing 😭😭😭</p>— Anthony (@omgitsbirdman) <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbirdman/status/1986972390522286156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a clip uploaded to Reddit, Scump and H3CZ were seen standing before a virtual slot machine and ‘feigning excitement’, running around the room, and screaming as the slot machine hit multipliers and bonuses.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The comments under the video were representative of the community sentiment around this situation. One wrote, ‘I don’t know how anyone can look at these two the same again. This is beyond cringe.’ Another said, ‘Been a fan for over a decade. I’m truly disappointed.’</p>



<p>Bag or no bag, this is an alienation step that doesn’t look good and will not be forgotten quickly by fans.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an issue with Scump and H3CZ hosting gambling streams? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9c0289c7c8b27"><a title="GUN Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c0289c7c8b27/gun-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever feel like getting your video game cowboy on, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and its kinda bloated sequel, as good as they are, just take way too long to bed into?</p>
<p>You know what I mean. Rockstar's epics are the obvious go-to choices in this scenario. However, sometimes I just want to shoot stuff in the cowboy style, almost immediately if possible, and I don't want to waste time with hugely intricate plots and overwhelming world aspects that drag a playthrough out to a triple-digit hour count. Who has time for that in this economy? (Me, but that's probably best kept for another article on a different website.)</p>
<p>There are a few options for a faster six-shooter fix. Indeed, Rockstar's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/red_dead_revolver">Red Dead Revolver</a> is much more in line with what I'm thinking. But you've more than likely played that, either at launch or once you'd made your way through Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/gun">GUN</a> <em>*kicks swinging saloon doors open*</em>, Neversoft's 2005 Western action effort, which is 20 years old today! Here's an oft-overlooked gem of a game that still has the capacity to serve you up exactly what you're after. Heck, it even still looks real purdy.</p>
<p>Now, we didn't review GUN back in the day, which is a shame <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/site-news-nintendo-life-turns-20-today">The website <strong>was</strong> only a day old!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but it reviewed well across the board, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. With the passing of time, you could actually consider one of the biggest criticisms at release — a very empty and smallish open world — as one of its stronger points nowadays. Especially if, like me, you never want to see another sprawling, icon-laden world map in your life. Well, not for a few weeks anyway.</p>

<p>Let's start with my favourite bit of this one: the cast.</p>
<p>We've got Thomas Jane, Lance Henriksen, Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, and none other than Kris "sort of a god" Kristofferson showing up in this Western tale, and they've not <em>just</em> shown up, either. They're not phoning it in and hightailing it out of there with their bag of swag. No. There's some solid acting going on, and as a result, the whole thing is given a completely unnecessary level of gravitas. The story here, written by Randall Jahnsen (of <strong>The Doors</strong> movie fame), is no match for Red Dead's hugely serious tale, make no mistake, but it isn't aiming for that. It's going for old-school tension, shocks, and twists that are more immediate in nature.</p>
<p>Jahnsen opted for a tale of revenge that plays it cold and ruthless in the classic <strong>Unforgiven</strong> vein. It revolves around Colton White (Jane) and his dad (Kristofferson) as they head off in search of Colton's dear Jenny (<strong>Rugrats</strong> alumni, Kath Souchie) who's been kidnapped by the murderous Reverend Reed (Dourif). Across the campaign, we're treated to violent shootouts, horseback action sequences and sweet on-rails sections that still play great today. I'm not just saying that either, I'm playing it right now, and it looks and feels very nice, thanks.</p>
<p>In fact, it plays much better than I remember, and the GameCube version is no slouch, running at a super smooth clip and looking every bit as nice as other ports. As I mentioned, the open world here is slight in its size and activities, a criticism in 2005, but now it means it's a much more straightforward and time-respectful sort of thing. There's no need to spend 100 hours picking flowers here, and you get to shoot stuff in the first couple of minutes. A win for common sense!</p>

<p>The shooting, which incorporates a de rigueur slo-mo six-shooter mechanic (here called QuickDraw), also comes off much better these days, I reckon. It was criticised — outside of those focused slo-mo parts — for being a little too tough to aim. However, I'm of the opinion that it's more authentic than tightly auto-aimed nonsense. You need to concentrate a bit and place your shots, and that works for me.</p>
<p>There's also a cracking lineup of era-authentic guns to collect from dead bosses and such along the way. Winchesters, Colts, Schofield rifles that blow heads into bloody pulp when aimed just so. You even get to do a little bit of archery, firing great big cannons. Have I mentioned that it's very bloody? Good.</p>
<p>So, the third-person pew-pew action, and the flow of the world, come off pretty great to this day, and it's a world that, despite its small scale, provides plenty of suitably epic vistas, alongside some impressive urban areas, whilst still managing to look fine in 2025. This is one of those 'early-noughties beige' numbers. You know, dusty and rusted in an attempt to seem adult, and as a result, it's got it where it counts in terms of atmosphere. It's very jaggy round the edges, for sure, but there's a level of detail and some proper cinematography going on, so it gets away with it.</p>

<p>Once the story kicks into gear, once Colton is on his way to Empire City to meet the likes of Mayor Hoodoo Brown (Perlman), and once all hell subsequently breaks loose, we're then treated to a lovely mix of shootouts, proper no-messing hard cowboy dialogue, and levels, such as a fantastic stagecoach one, that don't outstay their welcome. You also gotta turn up just to hear some classic gruff cowboy lines delivered with the swagger of this all-star cast, too.</p>
<p>GUN also benefits from a very edgy and 'of its time' attitude in some respects. It's a little subversive here and there (I won't spoil), and it even draws in some story influences from places you might not expect. It gets a bit...supernatural. So it's got a whole off-kilter thing going on, backed up by the weird awesomeness of that cast.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> an attempt to make the world feel bigger through the ability to track down a few wanted criminals, hunting animals, or doing a spot of ranching, but these are the parts where GUN falls down. No, it's in the crazy assembly of amazingly talented actors, in that uniquely rust-tinged noughties atmosphere, and in some incredibly violent and pleasing shootouts that GUN excels.</p>

<p>At 20 years of age, plenty of video game cowboys have long since hung up their holsters. GUN, though, if you're willing to give it a shot, still has it all where it counts. If you're hankerin' for some straightforward cowboy roleplaying, with no need for 100 hours to spare, or a therapist to get you through Arthur Morgan's trauma, you'll have a fairly tough time finding many games that fill the role better than Neversoft's crack at America's Wild West.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought that the Tony Hawks dev team would serve so hard in this particular genre?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t1-vs-kt-rolster-league-of-legends-worlds-2025-grand-final-preview-prediction.1347808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once again, it all comes down to this. The 2025 League of Legends World Championship tournament is about to culminate in a dream final: T1 vs. KT Rolster, two titans of the LCK. It’s a battle between the ultimate underdog and the reigning champions, and it’ll be a fight to determine <strong>a first Worlds win </strong>or <strong>another trophy in the expansive cabinet.</strong></p>



<p>We’re here to look at the match being dubbed a ‘Telecom War’ in Chengdu, the Grand Final of the League of Legends World Championship 2025. Read on to learn about the gravity of this match, what it means for League esports, and most importantly, which team is predicted to win.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-will-win-lol-worlds-2025">Who Will Win LoL Worlds 2025?</h2>



<p>T1 enters the battle on November 9 (depending on where you are) as the defending champion, chasing <strong>a third consecutive </strong>League Worlds championship and a record sixth win overall. Led by the iconic Faker, the team has weathered a pretty turbulent journey through the earlier stages, managing to peak when desperately required.</p>



<p>KT Rolster, meanwhile, is the hungry challenger and has made history just getting to the Grand Final. It’s the first time the organization has made it this far in League of Legends, and along the way, it required the squad to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">take down one of the frontrunners</a> in Gen.G.</p>



<p>Will KT Rolster make history?</p>



<p>Faker (T1) vs Bdd (KT) presents an opportunity for a generational clash to take place. It’s experience versus aggression, and it’s a coin flip to decide which way it’ll go.</p>



<p>There’s a huge prize pool on the line, and the winning team will grab a $1 million portion of the pot. This series is more about legacy than it is about the financials, though.</p>



<p>While T1 certainly holds the edge in experience and championship pedigree, it’s KT that has the momentum and hunger that could carry a roster all the way. They’re dangerous, and that might put T1 on the defensive going into the match best-of-five.</p>



<p>I’m ultimately predicting that this will be a relatively close series, with T1 closing it out 3-2 and walking away with yet another LoL Worlds trophy, pushing Faker even deeper into the history books.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win LoL Worlds.</p>
