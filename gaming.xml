<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has seen an influx of cheaters since it was released on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>That’s according to Call of Duty X handle (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1817575928312263085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieINTEL</a>, who has reported that an influx of cheaters has been spotted following the game’s debut in Game Pass. As CharlieINTEL points out, most cheaters appear with an Xbox logo in the game lobby. </p>



<p>Activision is yet to comment on the increase in cheaters, but given the game’s debut on Game Pass, which would offer the game to potentially 10’s of millions more players (34 million users as of February 2024), it isn’t difficult to see why there could be an influx of cheaters. The task now, though, is banning and preventing them from returning.</p>



<p>Before the release of Modern Warfare 3, Activision announced that its Richochet anti-cheat system was using machine learning and client—and server-side systems that continue to evolve and grow to combat cheating. In the lead-up to Modern Warfare 3, Richchet banned over 80,000 accounts during Monder Warfare 2 (80,000 accounts banned in 12 months).</p>



<p>We wouldn’t be surprised to see a blog post from Activision in the coming weeks about the issue, what they are doing to combat cheating, and how many more players have since been banned.</p>



<p>For now, though, players of Modern Warfare 3 will have to endure the influx of new cheaters.</p>



<p>Have you seen any cheaters in Modern Warfare 3? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/a-small-games-manifesto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hi, I am Brandon Dillon, co-founder of 2weeks, a new independent development studio building experimental games on the open web. As many of you know, games cost too much to make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m speaking less about the current economics of game development, though certainly much has been written about the difficulties faced by the industry during the current period of contraction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m speaking about the personal costs to us as developers. As a game’s team size expands, your relative contribution to the work shrinks. As development timelines rise, you get fewer opportunities to make new games. The risks increase as well: delays and cancellations can further dilute and erase your contributions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AAA games now often take 5-7 years to make. According to the 2023 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gameworkers.org/">gameworkers.org</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> survey, more than half of all developers (57.3%) worked on AAA games, and less than half (45%) had tenures longer than seven years. Many game developers are lucky to ship a single game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We find ourselves in a unique time - the pandemic led to a gaming bubble that has since burst, and rising interest rates have cut off the easy access to capital that could help studios weather the reversal, but these dynamics have only amplified a trend that has been steadily progressing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Raph Koster has been talking about the central cause for a long time: development budgets correlate with technology advancement, and both have been growing exponentially. Almost two decades ago, Koster gave a talk where he referred to this phenomenon as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/moores-wall-technology-advances-and-online-game-design/">Moore’s Wall</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moore’s Law is a famous observation in computing that the number of transistors in computer chips has doubled roughly every two years. After decades of consistent doubling, the phenomenon has led to astounding growth in the capabilities of our computing devices and will continue to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moore’s Wall represents the realization that the increase in content production needed to keep up with this growth will eventually hit an economic limit. Koster </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2018/01/17/the-cost-of-games/">updated his analysis in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and concluded that development costs for AAA games were increasing roughly 10x every 10 years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Audience growth has let us keep up with rising costs for a long time. Good news: gaming is now pervasive! NewZoo’s latest global gamer study shows that 94% of Gen Alpha play games. Bad news: this means audience growth is now just population growth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Development costs continue to grow exponentially, but audience growth no longer does. There’s still opportunity for growth in emerging markets, but it is not exponential. There’s an intercept point where our current approach to game development ceases to be economically feasible.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/illusion-of-skill-how-to-make-a-better-game-in-less-time" target="_self">The illusion of skill: how to make a better game in less time</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a good chance we’ve hit that point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what do we do?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some folks believe that AI tools will drive more efficiency, but as Koster notes that we’ve actually been getting more efficient at producing content the whole time; just not fast enough to keep up with the pace of technology. AI tools are not likely to close the gap. Koster has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/04/making-games-more-cheaply/">a number of useful suggestions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to manage rising costs including embracing tools, but mitigations are not enough. The thing we need to do is clear:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need to make smaller games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, indie developers have been building on a smaller scale the whole time, and they’ve become an increasingly important part of our ecosystem. Thanks to the Wall, that trend will continue. According to Konvoy, indie games accounted for 31% of all Steam revenue, and is up significantly so far in 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many AAA studios have their roots in this kind of small-scale development. Even the greatest epics of our medium trace back to smaller, more experimental games. GTA III, perhaps the strongest influence for the modern AAA open world formula, was developed in two years by a couple dozen people. Elden Ring traces its lineage back to King’s Field, developed in six months by ten people.</span></p><p>King’s Field for the PlayStation&nbsp;</p><p>Elden Ring</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as traditional studios have grown to larger and larger scales, they’ve lost their connection to this style of development. The work becomes more about building an efficient content production organization and less about finding new kinds of compelling gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s not to say that traditional studios don’t try. It’s hard not to - every studio is full of tons of talented and creative developers with compelling ideas for new games. Most large studios have some kind of internal incubation or prototyping process to try and harness that energy. Too often, though, projects from these incubation efforts fail to make it past the greenlighting process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Often, this has little to do with the potential market viability of the new game concept, and much more to do with the internal pressures at the studio. This isn’t just because of studio politics and risk aversion. As people have built massive organizations that have become heavily specialized in making a particular kind of game, it’s often simply too much risk to change that organization to build a different kind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet, something must change. Games that require massive teams are unsustainable and will hit an economic limit that will force studios to scale back, hurting teams and failing to meet player expectations. This will lead to stagnation and decline or has already.</span></p><p>Source: Video Game Business Management Economics, Eric Bailey</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re part of leadership at a traditional studio, it’s time to greenlight the risky new ideas - especially the ones that can scale without a huge content investment. Build smaller teams, take new, leaner approaches to production, to bring new games to market. Your future depends on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re a developer at a traditional studio, and you have ideas for newer, smaller concepts the studio can pursue, pitch them! Your studio needs to find new paths. If new paths don’t seem possible, keep an eye on the growth potential for the studio’s existing projects and make your own evaluation of the long-term sustainability of the studio’s approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re at a smaller indie studio, congratulations: you’re already part of the future of the industry. Be wary of ambitions to build the next big AAA studio. Most great franchises were born from small games and incremental investment. This is far from easy in a crowded market, but it’s the path to sustainable success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brandon Dillon</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Co-founder, 2weeks, a new independent game development studio building experimental games on the open web for you and your friends.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-than-movements-animation-in-mobile-game-dev.939339/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/more-than-movements-animation-in-mobile-game-dev<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My name is Mikhail, and I have been working in the animation and game development industry for over 8 years. I live in London and specialize in creating 2D/3D animations, providing feedback, and improving workflows for mobile games. Throughout my career, I have participated in numerous projects and collaborated with colleagues from different countries. However, I've noticed that many problems in the industry remain relevant year after year, despite technological advancements and the availability of knowledge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I want to share my thoughts, examine common problems in 2D/3D character animation and UI, and share my experience in solving them. If you are interested in game development or animation, this article is for you.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="IS IT ALIVE? PROBLEMS OF GAME ANIMATIONS">IS IT ALIVE? PROBLEMS OF GAME ANIMATIONS</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before delving into the issues of animation in games, I want to highlight the difference between two key concepts: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"animation"</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"motion."</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Although at first glance they may seem synonymous, there is a significant distinction between them. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Motion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is merely the foundation of animation, the physical movement of an object from point A to point B. It is an important component but does not encompass the essence of the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the art of bringing these movements to life, adding depth through the conveyance of characters' moods and emotions. It involves the use of principles such as timing, weight, expressiveness, and many others,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> to make the movements of characters or objects meaningful and emotionally rich</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In the context of games, animation plays a crucial role in enhancing the emotional impact of events and actions, as well as directing the player's attention where necessary.In the example below, I want to visually demonstrate how the perception of these two concepts affects the attractiveness of the result. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Please note that the character can be any inanimate object, even a UI button.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the first case (the white circle), the object moves linearly, conveying no mood, and as a result, the goal of animation is not fulfilled. It is merely boring mechanical movement, nothing more. In the second case (the yellow circle), character, weight, and awareness of the object begin to emerge, and we sense a playful mood.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="LIMITED ANIMATION vs. PRIMITIVE MOTIONS">LIMITED ANIMATION vs. PRIMITIVE MOTIONS</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>An animation software should not do the animation for us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Although this may seem paradoxical, a software merely speeds up the work process by creating in-between frames. One common mistake is using basic program interpolation (splines), which kills the illusion of life in characters or objects, creating a sense of boredom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splines </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>in animation are mathematical curves used to create smooth transitions between keyframes. Automatic splines allow the software to interpolate motion, providing smoother animation.</span></span></p><p>In animation, the idea is extremely important. If the character's motivation is immediately clear to the viewer, then the effect of emotional engagement will work (the animation courtesy of Playrix)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important to distinguish between</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> limited animation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which adheres to animation principles under limited resources, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>primitive linear movements</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that do not incorporate these principles (as in the example with the circles above). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limited animation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> involves creative choices to achieve high quality with limited means, whereas primitive movements often look unnatural and unattractive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limited animation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a technique where the minimum possible number of frames is used to save time and resources. This implies the reuse of some elements and less detail in movements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every movement in animation must be justified and stem from the character's traits, emotional state, physical weight, and the laws of physics. Issues such as unnatural movement of characters caused by the automatic application of splines, or their collision with "invisible walls," indicate the need for a deeper understanding and application of animation principles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="THE ART OF ANIMATION">THE ART OF ANIMATION</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The primary goal of an animator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not just to create the illusion of movement but to breathe life into it, making it part of a larger story. This requires not only technical skills but also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>creative vision</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Understanding and applying animation principles is key to creating compelling and memorable animation that will make players return to the game again and again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main problem is that some colleagues in the industry </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>perceive animation as something simple and unsophisticated</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. After all, one can always achieve quick results by setting a few keyframes, enabling frame interpolation, and the result immediately appears on the screen. But, as I've mentioned before, this only creates thoughtless movements, not animation. There's neither idea nor emotion in it. It's like a black-and-white sketch, a quick draft, but not a complete work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, in high-budget games, the main approach to creating animations is motion capture. However, it's not possible to just use data from actors and insert it into the game. The team of animators needs to do a lot of work adapting the motion capture to make the visuals brighter and more expressive. All animation principles, although based on real life, cannot exist outside animation software. A person cannot move only in arcs, make exclusively attractive movements, control spacing, and so on. In a game, we need to create a kind of theater, exaggerating our life, even for photorealistic genres.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Motion Capture</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> is the process of recording the movements of real people or objects for their subsequent use in animation. The motion data is applied to 3D models of characters in video games or films, allowing for realistic animation.</span></span></p><p>Apex Legends is one of the examples of games where motion capture was used</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="CREATIVE CONTROL">CREATIVE CONTROL</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Relying solely on program-generated movements, an animator deprives themselves of control over the animation process. Players might not be able to explain why the animation looks bad, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they subconsciously feel it</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is especially noticeable when it comes to the poor execution of character performance. Unclear poses and mechanical, abrupt movements create a sense of repulsion, prompting the user to close the game and find something less irritating. In a highly competitive environment, this becomes a significant problem for developers, considering that users can now install triple-A games even on mobile devices, where the level of detail is much higher. Undoubtedly, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>a big budget is not a guarantee of success</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the visual quality of such products often surpasses that of competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coming from the world of animated series into game development, I immediately realized the extent of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>restrictions present in games</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Due to the strict technical requirements of game engines, the freedom of creativity is greatly reduced. For example, when creating visual effects, it's necessary to strictly adhere to particle count limits, which can restrain the realization of ambitious ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the realm of mobile development, Spine is often used for 2D animations. However, game projects typically have limitations </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>on the number of bones and mesh points,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> questioning the ability to create complex animations. Beginner animators sometimes get carried away by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>adding an excessive number of elements</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, thinking that this will directly improve the animation. In reality, the quality and effectiveness of animated content are determined not by the number of elements but by the ability to use them wisely and appropriately to achieve the desired effect within the task at hand. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minimalism is the key to success!</span></span></p><p>An example of a character from Spine 2D</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Project organization must also be impeccable; otherwise, even minor errors can lead to serious problems. For instance, in games, it's not uncommon to see characters' bones turning inside out or characters suddenly falling through objects. Nevertheless, the entire work process can be fascinating. Sometimes, the art lies in how elegantly a situation is played out, turning disadvantages into advantages. All these restrictions do not hinder the creation of smooth and harmonious movements.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="THE ROOT OF POOR QUALITY">THE ROOT OF POOR QUALITY</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>One of the primary goals of animation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is to convince the player of the realism of the character or situation. On mobile phones, the limited screen size does not allow for the same depth of involvement compared to a television or monitor screen. Therefore, the character's emotions </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>must be clear and expressive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so that the player can instantly understand the mood of the situation, whether it's the joy of victory or the disappointment of defeat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We create smooth and energetic movements of game elements, but definitely not abrupt ones. It's important that the character and visual effects </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>enhance the emotional impact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the game situation, without confusing the user with their ambiguity. For example, when an important dramatic scene occurs. If the poses and movements in such a situation are abrupt, the player simply will not understand what happened.</span></p><p>Example of great animation: the drama of a scene is achieved through precise timing and clear poses (example from Ori and The Blind Forest)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animation is an art</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that combines visual creativity, acting skills, and complex technical approaches. An animator must simultaneously consider dozens of aspects, investing their personal emotions into the work, as well as playing a role, even if it's a living chair or a beetle. We have to control a multitude of bones and character controllers, all the while keeping an eye on the principles of animation. Therefore, I constantly repeat the importance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>a comprehensive approach to the workflow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Animation is often studied in a chaotic order, leading to systematic errors. People can work in the game industry for many years, but continue to make fundamental mistakes. I understand that this problem is widespread in many fields, but in the case of animation, it can lead to the need for hours of work to correct them due to a lack of fundamental knowledge.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="MAKING MISTAKES IS NORMAL">MAKING MISTAKES IS NORMAL</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The animator's path is impossible without constant challenges and mistakes, which deserves great respect. Creating new animation is a new trial every time. However, in this article, I'm not expressing a subjective opinion.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> I cannot simply tell a colleague, "I don't like your work. Redo it."</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, I analyze any animations frame by frame and demonstrate through specific examples how the animation can be improved.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> I explain</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in detail the principles of tracking body parts, showing exactly where sharp spacing (the distance between frames) occurs, at what moments there is a lack of body part lag, where the pose can be strengthened, balance added, and so on. Holding all this information in mind is extremely difficult, so making mistakes is normal. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The main thing is not to be overconfident and to be open to help from others.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most pleasant moments in game animation, when it's easy to achieve a good and fast result, is the basic idle animation of a character. If you want to successfully complete a task and lift your spirits, animate idle! Adding offsets creates a pleasant effect of motion delay (overlapping), and the calm state does not raise questions. Although keyframe offsetting provides a pleasant visual effect, it is still not full-fledged animation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I most often observe is the application of the same principles to more active animations, such as lifting an object. As a result, the character either starts moving as if in zero gravity or, conversely, jerks like an old mechanical toy, violating all the laws of physics. And in my opinion, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the root of evil lies precisely in the superficial approach to animation.</span></span></p><p>Animators often have to balance speed and quality of work (Image courtesy of Playrix)</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="MISTAKES BRING EXPERIENCE">MISTAKES BRING EXPERIENCE</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have made all the mentioned mistakes repeatedly, and it is only through experience that I can speak openly about them. Even now, I make mistakes because</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> we cannot achieve perfection in everything</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The most important thing is to constantly work on oneself, strive for self-improvement, continuously study new approaches, and openly accept feedback. I strongly recommend playing various game genres, watching cartoons, and maintaining communication with industry colleagues. We cannot afford to ignore market trends and new technologies.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Picture taken on the first day I joined the team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is important to note that the level changed a lot for multiple reasons, making it completely different from my design. Therefore, there is no need to refer to the game; reading this article is enough. And in this article, I will focus on the methods and processes. Also, I did this about three years ago when I was less experienced and faced many challenges with frequent revisions. In this article, I will simplify and highlight only the aspects proved effective.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Determine What It Is">Determine What It Is</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the game world, it is a silent street where the main characters live and work, while in the game, it’s the start menu. Therefore, it should provide access to most of the game’s functions. A menu should be user-friendly, so the map should be easy to navigate, allowing players to reach functions without having to search extensively. Additionally, moving between these functions should be engaging, meaning the time spent traveling between points should be controlled.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To compare, it’s similar to levels like the village in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter: Rise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and Dedsec’s den of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Watch Dogs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series. These areas are the most stylized place in their respective games. So I believe Sixth Street should also be highly stylized, both in terms of shape and structure.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Functions">Functions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned above, this is essentially a menu, so the first step is to gather information about the functions that should be included. This involves identifying entrances to all gameplay elements and peripherals. For example, the start of main story and where players gacha. I obtained this information from the system design team and prioritized these elements accordingly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are also functions that go beyond the basic gameplay elements, such as the inherent features of the location itself. For example, characters encountered in the story may visit, so there should be natural spawn points that are easy to encounter. Additionally, maybe later, the main character holds a concert, a gathering place is necessary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once I had all the functions, I mapped out their relationships, considering spatial, temporal, and visibility factors. Each function was represented with a bubble diagram. Some functions have similar settings, such as a store and a bookshop, which might be placed adjacent to each other and grouped into a district.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="World building">World building</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To create a virtual place that make sense, world building is essential. “Make sense” means not only ensuring that the functions work well within the place, but also the place fits and showcases the game’s world setting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reference Gathering">Reference Gathering</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first step is reference gathering, which involves two types of references: prototypes and art references.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prototypes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;are places with similar functions to the place you want to create. These can be real world location or settings from other works of art. For Sixth Street, a prototype could be a street with single-family detached houses and stores, an old but cozy residential area near the city center, or a street with a well-known video shop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using prototype references is valuable even if the map is not based on a real-world location because they provide information that has been tested by time and people. Instead of copying these places, I analyzed their features and the reason behind them. For example, I considered the percentage and allocation of businesses facilities, the influence of modern urban planning theories, and the context or relationship with other parts of the city. This analysis helps ensure that the virtual place feels authentic and well-integrated into the game’s world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To use a reference, the first step is to identify the specific reason for using it. For example, if the reference pertains to the percentage of businesses in an area, I might need to compare it with places that have different business percentages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most memorable features I found in the prototypes was influenced by a policy: in Japan, if someone wants to build a house, they must purchase the land. Due to Japan’s mountainous terrain, the shapes of the land parcels vary greatly, leading to diverse architectural shapes. This unique characteristic is the flavor I need for the place, so it becomes a guiding principle for the design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Art references</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;are used for visualization. They include places that fit or provide inspiration for the artistic style. These references can be at various scales — props, stores, buildings, or entire districts. All are valuable for creating a cohesive and visually appealing environment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Image Analysis">Image Analysis</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After gathering references, the next step is image analysis, which involves examining both the overall site and its individual components.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The image of the whole site</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;pertains to how the location functions within the game world. In this project, characters gather on Sixth Street for various reasons, so it serves as a node within the game world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, I analyzed the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>image of each part of the site</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For example, characters might visit the street because of the video shop, making the video shop a node within Sixth Street.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>block-out process</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the focus is on emphasizing these images through structure, roads, and decoration. For instance, I created a curved road around the video shop’s front facade, using the echo effect to emphasize its importance. From a decoration perspective, I used numerous lines to symbolize the televisions, connecting the video shop with other parts of the street and implying its relative position. This approach ensures that each node is distinct and effectively integrated into the overall design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the design process, I encountered several problems. Here are two notable issues:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Metrics Issue"><span>The Metrics Issue</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating a seamless experience was challenging due to the game’s ultra-fast ACT mechanics, which made determining metrics a significant hurdle. (My previous work on combat metrics provided valuable experience, which I plan to discuss in future articles.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, I used the combat 3Cs for Sixth Street, which led to problems: the spaces were large, making a corner store appear as large as a stadium. The high ceilings made it nearly impossible to create variations in elevation. Additionally, the movement cadence in Sixth Street differed from combat areas; players might stop anywhere, making it easy to notice unrealistic building sizes, breaking immersion. After discussing with team members, I decided to develop new metrics and create a dedicated 3Cs for this area.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Art Accident"><span>The Art Accident</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The design process went smoothly, and the grey box worked perfectly in the engine for several weeks. However, when the art phase began, an unexpected issue arose: the headquarters wanted the artists to determine the map structure. This meant discarding my work and using a map designed solely by the artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was frustrating and nonsensical, but I understood that Hoyoverse values art highly, which has contributed to their success in previous projects. To move forward, compromise was necessary. This situation made me reconsider the level designer’s highest priority, which should never be compromised. Ultimately, I found ways to adapt certain areas of the map to fit my spatial relationships, ensuring the most basic functions were preserved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@liuxinyan0227/level-design-postmortem-sixth-street-zenless-zone-zero-56cfde7b497e">This blog first appeared on Medium and has been published with the author's permission.</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-gets-last-patch-for-a-while-devs-planning-new-ports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1817893663994794092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Landfall broke down the new Content Warning patch, and confirmed plans for future updates and ports for new platforms.</p>



<p>The latest patch for Content Warning is now live, introducing a range of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes. However, the devs say it will be “the last patch for a while.”</p>



<p>Landfall explains that Content Warning creatives have “prior commitments to another project they’ve been working on with another team since 2021.” The nature of that project is currently unclear, but mentioning 2021 does give fans an idea of the development timeline.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The new Content Warning patch is live! 🎉</p><p>It's mostly bug fixes but we've also added a sketch pad and language options for matchmaking so you can choose to play with others speaking your language 🗣️ <a href="https://t.co/eOKfHtkoqW">pic.twitter.com/eOKfHtkoqW</a></p></div>— Landfall (@LandfallGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/LandfallGames/status/1817893663994794092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Today’s post also finally confirms Landfall’s interest in pursuing new Content Warning ports. The devs stated they are already “looking into getting the game onto other platforms.” There is no mention of exactly which platforms players should expect.</p>



<p>Landfall added that it will update fans about those ports, as well as the future of the game, “before the end of the year.” </p>



<p>Content Warning first launched in April 2024 and quickly became an indie darling. It still maintains ‘Very Positive’ Steam reviews. </p>



<p>Just a couple of months later in June 2024, Landfall revealed that Content Warning reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-console-release-possibly-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.2 million copies sold</a>. In that same announcement, Landfall also teased the potential of console ports for Content Warning. However, it did not confirm it was actively looking into them just yet.</p>



<p>The latest Content Warning patch adds a new sketch pad, language options, additional LODs for performance, and more.</p>

But what defines the combat of a Mana game?</p><p><strong>Masaru Oyamada, Producer:</strong> “From the start of the series, the <em>Mana</em> games have featured multiple weapons and magic spells for the player to wield—as well as enjoyable <a title="Genres > RPG [16,451 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> character growth systems. So, it was important that people feel those elements strongly in <em>Visions of Mana</em> too!”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Ryosuke Yoshida, Director:</strong> “One of the most important elements of <em>Mana</em> games is that feeling that you’re interacting with the elementals (spirits that control elements like wind, fire or darkness).</p><p>“That’s at the core of the design of <em>Visions of Mana</em> and something that was really important to me. It’s such a vital part of that distinctive Mana series identity, and if the battles didn’t capture it, there would be no point to the game at all!</p><p>“In <em>Visions of Mana</em>, we focus the flow of battle around the use of the Elemental Vessels—potent weapons infused with elemental magic. These artifacts use the Elemental’s powers to manifest mysterious primal forces, such as trapping the foe in water bubbles or pinning them in the air with wind blasts. </p><p>“The effects they create can also be changed in various ways through the player’s <a title="Genres > Action [2,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, which creates a fun dynamic where it feels like you are interacting with the Elementals as you fight.”</p><p><strong>■ Getting to the Core of Combat</strong></p><p>The combat in <em>Visions of Mana</em> is very fast and fluid. You’ll have consider lots of different aspects, from positioning to the abilities you unleash, but you’ll soon be able to take down foes in spectacular style. </p><p>There’s a lot of amazing powers to use in combat, especially when you start using Elemental Vessels, but before they could get into that, the developers had to make sure the basics of battle were rock solid.</p><p><strong>Yoshida:</strong> “When we were thinking about how to design the battle system, we didn’t just look at the combat in isolation. Instead we tried to make it something that tied closely into the overall concept that was decided for the game.</p><p>“Central mechanics like switching between three party members in battle, using ring menu and shortcut bindings are inspired by elements from past Mana games. However, I had a strong desire to put more weight on switching between different characters during combat. </p><p>“One way we did this, for example, was through the Elemental Vessels and the gameplay options they offer. You have a party of three characters and can equip each one with a different Elemental Vessel that manifests different effects. It’s possible to follow up after you use one of these effects by switching and using a different elemental power to create an even more potent compound ability. </p><p>“In this way we create motivation and benefits for the player to switch between different characters in battle.</p><p>“That said, we took care not to make it so important that switching became compulsory. To that end, we avoided creating enemies that can’t be defeated unless you jump between characters.”</p><p><strong>■ Elemental Vessels</strong></p><p>As mentioned, the Elemental Vessels are central to both combat and traversal in the game. These artifacts, bestowed on the player by the eight elementals over the course of the game, offer you new ways to get around the world, and special powers to use during battles.</p><p>This was a core focus for the game and sits at the heart of the experience. Naturally, that meant it was something the team were very careful to make as satisfying and exciting to use as possible.</p><p><strong>Yoshida:</strong> “I felt it was very important to have a consistent feel across the whole game, with a design that tied both the battles and the exploration to the core concept of interacting with the elementals as sentient beings.</p><p>“The tools that let us realize this concept practically are the Elemental Vessels.”</p><p><strong>Oyamada:</strong> “The <em>Mana</em> series has always featured eight distinct elementals with each embodying one of the core forces that shape the world. Naturally then, there would be eight vessels that house each of their powers. We came up with lots of interesting ideas for different objects to use, but ultimately aimed to create designs that would best capture the interesting aspects of each elemental.”</p><p><strong>■ Vessel of Earth: Gnome Shovel</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Visions-of-Mana-PV_07-29-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>In the video, we show three Elemental Vessels: Earth, Light, and Darkness. Producer Oyamada and director Yoshida offered some insight into the creation of these vessels—and the associated abilities.</p><p><strong>Oyamada:</strong> “The concept for the Vessel of Earth was ‘defense.’ When used, it surrounds the player in a solid, rocky shield that protects against attacks.”</p><p><strong>Yoshida:</strong> “It took a little trial and error to get right though! Originally, it created a gigantic wall of earth which would protect the player from attacks. Unfortunately, we found that summoning a huge barrier into the battle area obstructed the player’s vision. Plus, enemies attack from multiple angles anyway, so it didn’t really protect them at all. So, we switched the current idea, where the vessel creates a dome-like shield out of semi-transparent rocks!”</p><p><strong>■ Vessel of Light: Lumina Lantern</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Visions-of-Mana-PV_07-29-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Oyamada:</strong> “The concept behind this one was ‘reflection.’ Using the Lumina Lantern, the player can link enemies together with rays of light, reflecting the damage from one enemy to another!”</p><p><strong>■ Vessel of Darkness: Shade Sight</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Visions-of-Mana-PV_07-29-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Oyamada:</strong> “The idea behind this vessel was ‘gravitation’. When the elemental is unleashed, it creates a black hole, which draws in enemies.”</p><p><strong>Yoshida:</strong> “Our battle director innocently brought up that he was curious about what would happen if there was a lake or river close by and suggested the water should be sucked up along with the enemies. However, there aren’t many battle areas which are next to lakes in the first place, and if we were going to do this, it would have created a heap of problems, such as when would the water come back!</p><p>“So, understandably, we soon abandoned that particular idea (laughs).”</p><p><strong>■ Class Acts</strong></p><p>Equipping an Elemental Vessel to a character changes their class, giving them new abilities, weapons, and even costumes. Every vessel can be equipped to every character, which makes for a lot of variety regarding how you customize your party.</p><p><strong>Yoshida:</strong> “We came up with the specifications for the different weapons and classes alongside those of the Elemental Vessels. </p><p>“We did so because we knew from the start that future balancing would be needed to ensure that none of weapons and actions paired with the vessels would break the system.</p><p>“This meant that by the time we reached the prototyping stage, all the vessel’s basic effects were already decided and we could focus on the final balancing between the classes. Not only that, but we could also make up for any areas where a class was less distinct by adding unique abilities and altering their parameters.”</p><p><strong>Oyamada:</strong> “Once we decided that there would be eight different elements, we designed ideas for each character’s classes based on combinations of the different Elemental Vessel effects and weapon types.</p><p>“Of course, these still went through changes over development. For example, we originally went with more of a succubus-style appearance for Careena’s darkness-based class, but our character designer Haccan proposed a great idea which swayed us in a different direction. I think this turned out great and captures her cheery personality too!”</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAG-AFTRA</a> strike won't impact GTA 6, or indeed any other game that started development before September 2023. That's due to a prior stipulation, although SAG-AFTRA isn't happy about this, as Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> to Aftermath:</p>
<p><em>We're obviously not happy about that. That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before the merger of SAG and AFTRA. It's language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.</em></p>
<p><em>We do believe that there are certain titles that we can challenge, and we are preparing ourselves to bring a challenge with respect to the application of this language with respect to some of the titles. So we are doing our best to wage the strike as effectively and as strongly as we can – even in spite of that language being there.</em></p>
<p>In theory, the exemption also applies to live service games since all those have obviously started development way before September 2023. However, SAG-AFTRA isn't too keen on letting this slide. Rodriguez added:</p>
<p><em>If you apply this language that we're talking about to live-service games, they become contracts of unlimited duration, and there is a law that a contract of unlimited duration can be terminated on reasonable notice. So that's what we've done: We have provided reasonable notice that we are terminating our contract with respect to those live-service games.</em></p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA voted on the strike mainly because it couldn't reach an agreement to protect its workers from the dangers of AI utilization in the industry. We'll keep you updated if there's any news on the ongoing strike.</p>

		<p>We now know who we will be playing as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion,</a>&nbsp; Zula Hendricks. She is described as “an unbreakable ex-Colonial Marine, on a dangerous mission that brings her to the uncharted planet Purdan.”</p>
<p>”&nbsp;With her sentient AI companion, Davis-01, Zula must fight her way to the heart of the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions black-site facility.&nbsp;There she will need to survive deadly attacks from the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered and discover new horrors and threats that once unleashed could spell the end for humankind.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Zula Hendricks Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/49WAFl7u6gA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Alien game project has been in development for the last two years at VR specialists Survios. The company burst on the scene with the dawn of VR with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/raw-data-review/">Raw Data</a> in 2016, before bringing the rapid releases of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/22/sprint-vector-review/">Sprint Vector</a>, Electonauts and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/21/creed-rise-to-glory-psvr-2-release-date-april/">Creed: Rise to Glory</a> through 2018.</p>
<p>There’s a rich pedigree for Survios and VR, in other words, but really the main reason why people will be excited for Alien: Rogue Incursion is because of 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The celebrated horror game was once shown as being playable in VR prior to release, and fans have long wanted to see a VR version of the game released – hopes that will sadly never be realised at this point. Hopefully Rogue Incursion can be the VR horror surrogate that we need.</p>

<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of Alien and have been building Alien: Rogue Incursion for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” says TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer at Survios. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of Alien, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion will launch on&nbsp; PSVR 2, Meta Quest 3 and Steam VR this&nbsp;Holiday 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.</p>
<p>In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test," Keller <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2357570/view/4352250327659121671?l=english">writes in the post</a>. "Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we're exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results."</p>
<p>Don't expect those tests to begin anytime soon, however, as there are a number of obstacles. "The first, and honestly largest, reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I'm referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match," Keller goes on.</p>
<p>He notes that Overwatch 2 has seen several upgrades and additions that impact performance, such as HUD outlines for allied heroes and fancier map fixtures. "In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player's experience."</p>
<p>As such, "while a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game," Keller writes. "This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish."</p>
<p>The bigger issue, however, may be the effect of a return to 6v6 on the game's multiplayer queue times. A fair chunk of Keller's blog is devoted to explaining how the combination of role queues and the original 12-a-side format led to delays finding a match. Blizzard were not able to really address this problem in the first game, Keller comments, hence shrinking the headcount in Overwatch 2. He's not 100% confident they'll fare better second time around.</p>
<p>"Another issue, and one that still gives me anxiety about opening this Pandora's Box, is what to do with queue times if enough players prefer 6v6 to keep some form of it around," the post goes on. "The team was not able to solve this issue previously. While we have some ideas now, there's no guarantee that they will work. </p>
<p>"Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that's a pretty risky move to make. We also have tens of millions of new players that have only played 5v5. We want to be openly mindful not to frustrate those who like the game as it is today."</p>
<p>In the event that Blizzard do host some 6v6 tests, these would likely run for a few weeks, with the results being compared against regular Overwatch 2 modes. "We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for," Keller says. "Whether that's a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."</p>
<p>Keller is upfront about the fact that the evolution of Overwatch into Overwatch 2 was a trade-off that has alienated much of the first game's audience. "The game started its life with six players on each team," he writes. "I discussed why we moved away from 6v6, but that doesn't mean it's without any merit. There were moments and madness that could happen with twelve players in a match that just don't quite coalesce when there are ten."</p>
<p>The occasional feeling of overwhelm was "part of the charm", Keller adds. "There are big moments in Overwatch 2, but they don't quite have that same chaotic, over-the-top feeling to them." More specifically, having two tanks in the mix per side "had a stabilizing effect on gameplay" whereby "teams would fold a bit slower than they do now".</p>
<p>The sequel is a more focussed competitive experience and perhaps, the superior esport, but it doesn't have the same sense of abandon, Keller acknowledges. "When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it's clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match," the post concedes. "We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel "the same" from game to game."</p>
<p>"While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we'd like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it."</p>
<p>The on-going dislike for Overwatch 2 (it still has a Mostly Negative user review consensus on Steam) is about more than 5v5, of course. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2s-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-launch-brings-years-of-frustration-to-the-boil">Take your pick</a>: the first game no longer being available, making the sequel a forced replacement; the retiring of certain grand plans for story modes; nickel-and-diming players with the battle pass. Still, there's a great hero sandbox in there somewhere, and the prospect of a tentative move back toward the first game's looser, wildcard ethos is encouraging.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> fans believe a trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax earlier this month points to the game's currently unrevealed second expansion, likely due in 2025.</p>
<p>Bethesda's space RPG released last year, and is set to launch its first expansion Shattered Space in the coming months. In conversation with YouTuber MrMattyPlays back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed there would be at least one more expansion to come after Shattered Space</a>, stating the studio was already "planning for the one after this".</p>
<p>It now appears that this 'planning' has made further progress, thanks to that aforementioned trademark. As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222">Timur222</a> on social media platform X, Bethesda has filed a trademark for something known as <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/986/45/starborn-98645285.html">Starborn</a>. What is a Starborn? We'll explain below - so <strong>beware of small Starfield spoilers</strong>.</p>

<p>A mysterious group known as Starborn feature in the base game. They have passed through a portal known as the Unity and travelled between universes. Starborn only reveal themselves to the heroic Constellation group after enough of the game's Artefacts have been collected.</p>
<p>Purely speculatively for now, this trademark suggests that Starfield's next DLC after Shattered Space could focus on this group, perhaps expanding on the group's origins and their abilities to visit different universes.</p>
<p>We shall have to wait and see.</p>

<p>As for more imminent DLC, we got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">first proper look at Starfield's Shattered Space expansion</a> earlier this year, when Bethesda released a space-horror flavoured trailer during Xbox's summer showcase. You can check it out in the video above.</p>
<p>Shattered Space will offer a fresh mystery involving the snake-loving House Va'ruun, at some point later in 2024.</p>

If you disagree, you can do that somewhere else,” due to “brigading” in the comments.</p><p>The post followed a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">controversial statement</a> issued by Ubisoft to Japanese fans in which the company apologized for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">promotion materials</a> it said “have caused concern” among the community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows Concept Art With Historical Re-Enactment Group's Flag</h3></div></output><p>The four-page message, posted in both English and Japanese, explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is not intended to be a factual representation of history. Instead, it is described as “a compelling, historical fiction set in Feudal Japan. Ubisoft added that it hoped Shadows would “spark curiosity” in players who then research the historical period the game is inspired by.</p><p>In addition to the apology regarding the marketing materials, the message also discussed Yasuke, one of Shadows’ two protagonists: “While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven this carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.”</p><p>While Yasuke has often been presented as a samurai in popular media, both in Japan and beyond, his depiction in Shadows has given rise to debate regarding the historical truth. The argument has lived side-by-side with criticism over Ubisoft’s decision to feature a Black man as a lead protagonist in a Japan-set Assassin’s Creed game – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-condemns-hateful-acts-against-developers-following-ac-shadows-backlash"><u>a backlash Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot alluded to while condemning “malicious and personal online attacks.”</u></a></p><p>The statement noted that the Assassin’s Creed series has always taken “creative license and incorporated fantasy elements” into its historically-inspired settings. “The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of this. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an Assassin’s Creed story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>The mod team behind r/assassinscreed said Ubisoft’s statement “exacerbated” what it called “this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death,” and gave users of the subreddit a “final reminder” of what the Assassin’s Creed franchise entails.</p><p>Here’s the r/assassinscreed mod team’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>With the reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows, there has been an influx of certain individuals spilling into various communities online such as this subreddit and raising arguments about "historical accuracy". As we are all exhausted of this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death, not to mention exacerbated by a recent official statement from Ubisoft, we would like to give a final reminder to those participating in these debates as to what exactly this franchise entails, and why there was never any point to these discussions to begin with outside of thinly veiling bad faith intent.</blockquote><blockquote>Assassin's Creed is historical fiction. This means that while certain locations, events and figures may be based on reality, and can even have a slight focus on accuracy, their depictions are largely exaggerated for the sake of a more enjoyable video game. While all of our player protagonists have been fictional to date, the introduction of Yasuke has given some people the false impression that the above rule does not apply. It still does. Yasuke, who is a samurai as confirmed by multiple reputable historians around the world including from Japan, may not have held as large as a role in the real world as he does in Shadows. This is okay. It is a video game. You are not meant to use Assassin's Creed as a sourcebook for actual historical knowledge - it is meant to compel you to do your own external research after immersing you in a glimpse of authenticity.</blockquote><blockquote>We are not here in this community to debate on historical record. Most of us understand as fans that while these games provide us a great look into what historical settings could have felt like and have fun comparing them to actual record, we do not chase accuracy within this franchise and primarily play for other reasons. So if you are specifically here to leave comments about your displeasure about Yasuke's inclusion or various other inaccurate details that have been pointed out in Ubisoft's depiction of Feudal Japan, it is time to understand that this is not the place for this discussion and it never will be. Feel free to take your displeasures elsewhere, away from this franchise and its communities.</blockquote><blockquote>Any further comments attempting to dispute Yasuke's societal status, disparage his inclusion in game or containing statements bordering on concern trolling for historical accuracy will be swiftly removed and met with a ban.</blockquote><p>The mod team also provided a list of links to reddit posts explaining how the Assassin’s Creed series has handled historical accuracy in previous games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The post outlines the subreddit’s firm stance on Shadows, and is a clear attempt to draw a line under what has become one of the big talking points around the game. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-reddit-takes-firm-stance-on-yasuke-debate-says-ubisoft-exacerbated-issue-with-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> pointed out, this debate has spilled over into the real-world, with a fringe Japanese politician requesting the Japanese government comment on the matter. But so far there has been no meaningful result.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches November 12, 2024 for those buying the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-collectors-edition"><u>Gold, Ultimate, Deluxe Editions</u></a>, or Collector's Editions, while the Standard Edition is available on November 15, 2024.

            <p>Balatro is the latest thing that can seemingly run the seminal 90s shooter Doom.</p>
<p>"Literally nobody asked for it, but here it is: Doom on Balatro," announced u/UwUDev on reddit, appending a video that proves they've somehow embedded Zoom into the poker game's Joker collection screen.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I didn't think anyone would care. I'd just done it for fun/challenge, but since the community seems to like it, I'm planning something even more impressive and stupid," UwuDev said.</p>
<p>"It's super laggy and I often have big lag spikes but it works. I'll see later if I can optimise it because it's really unplayable," they acknowledged later in the thread.</p>

<p>It's a long-running joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything, including Fortrnite, Team Fortress 2, a pregnancy test, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-is-now-playable-on-a-tractor">a tractor</a>, and a piece of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-piece-of-lego-can-now-play-doom">Lego</a>.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Balatro is getting a physical edition. Localthunk confirmed last month that fans will soon be able to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-is-getting-a-physical-edition-on-playstation-switch-and-xbox-consoles">pick up a physical copy of the game on PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles</a>.</p>

            <p>
Doctor Who and Star Trek are officially crossing over, with David Tennant's iconic Tenth Doctor and his future wife River Song meeting characters from the animated Star Trek: Lower Decks series. 
</p>
<p>
The crossover will take place as a limited-time event beginning 1st August in two mobile games: <a href="https://bit.ly/STLD">Star Trek: Lower Decks - The Badgey Directive</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/46OOf53">Doctor Who: Lost in Time</a>.
</p>
<p>
Events in both games will show different perspectives of the same wibbly-wobbly space-time macguffin, with Ten onboard Lower Deck's USS Cerritos and River Song joined by crewmembers Lieutenant Brad Boimler and Ensign Beckett Mariner.
</p>
<p>
Both mobile games are developed by the same studio, Eastside Games, which specialises in making licensed spin-offs for major TV series brands. Each offers their own selection of new stories for their respective franchises, unlocked via collecting a large cast of characters.
</p>
<p>
This is, as far as I can recall, the first time Star Trek and Doctor Who have joined forces in the world of video games - though the two long-running sci-fi series have nodded to each other multiple times over the years. 
</p>
<p>
The latest season of Doctor Who included Ncuti Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor making reference to visiting Star Trek, the latest of various references in each show to the other. Most notably, Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor teamed up with the legendary Jean-Luc Picard in an eight-issue comic book series back in 2012, which saw the pair fighting a combined threat of the Cybermen and the Borg. 
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, showrunner Russell T Davies has said he's attempted to get an actual TV crossover episode made where the Doctor visits the Enterprise - though, so far, it's yet to happen. Perhaps this could be used to gauge interest?

			<p>The NVIDIA DLSS upscaler continues to be the best upscaler on the market, achieving impressive results that look considerably better than native resolutions.</p>
<p>A new comparison video based on the 3.7 version of the upscaler put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts native 1440p, 1440p in Quality mode and 4K in Performance mode side by side in five games - Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Forbidden West, The Witcher 3 Next-Gen, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 and Ghost of Tsushima, highlighting how, in terms of visual quality, 4K with DLSS Performance mode is clearly better than native 1440p and 1440p in Quality Mode in every game. The performance hit, in some cases, such as in Cyberpunk 2077, may not make 4K with Performance mode worth it for some, but generally, it is always the better choice, especially if the game also supports Frame Generation.</p>

<p>As time passes, NVIDIA DLSS continues to be adopted by a variety of different games. Among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-supported-latest-games-include-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-marvel-rivals-beta-final-fantasy-xiv-online/">new games</a> supporting the upscaler are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, which also supports Frame Generation, the Bladekisser DLC for Trepang 2, and Final Fantasy XIV Online, which received NVIDIA DLSS 2 support with the update that introduced support for the latest expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-benchmark-test-previews-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-additions-and-graphics-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawntrail</a>.</p>

            <p>12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade, Castle Crashers is getting new DLC.</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the DLC is only coming to Steam.</p>

<p>"Didn't have a Castle Crashers DLC in my 2024 bingo card," said one happy fan in the YouTube comments.</p>
<p>There's no price tag or firm release date yet – "coming soon" is all Behemoth will commit to for now – but, as always, we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, Alien Hominid HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p>
<p>If you're a fan of Xbox 360 games, don't forget that Microsoft is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">close its Xbox 360 digital store later today (29th July)</a>.

            <p>NetherRealm has announced Mortal Kombat 1 DLC Khaos Reigns, which will expand the game's story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative.</p>
<p>"When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger," reads the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-223900046.html">official blurb</a>. "If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the Mortal Kombat 1 team has revealed its next Kombat Pack, which will provide players with more fighters to add to their roster. Upcoming fighters include returning kombatants Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang; Cyrax, voiced by Enuka Okuma; and Sektor, voiced by Erika Ishii. These three all have "unique backstories as part of the reimagined Mortal Kombat 1 Universe". For example, Sektor and Cyrax are both women in this universe.</p>
<p>As well as the fighters mentioned above, Kombat Pack 2 will also bring three guest fighters into the fray: Scream's Ghostface,  T-1000 (the liquid metal-based Terminator and cybernetic assassin from Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Conan the Barbarian. T-1000 will not only feature the likeness of Robert Patrick. The actor will also be providing the voice as well. Conan, meanwhile, only features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Kombat Pack 2 is not available as a standalone character bundle.</p>
<p>Rounding out the most recent batch of Mortal Kombat 1 news, the team also announced Animalities will be returning as a free content update for all owners. This upcoming feature will allow characters to "morph into their spirit animal". Then, once in their animalistic forms, they can "annihilate" their defeated opponents.</p>
<p>You can see a suitably bloody trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>We awarded the game three out of five stars on its release last year. "Death, Taxes, and Mortal Kombat. The name is established, the lore is beloved, the roster is compelling, and the community is extremely passionate," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-review">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat 1 review</a> from September.</p>
<p>"It will be a part of the fighting game scene, both competitively and casually, now and forever. But serious evolution is needed if this franchise is to keep up with the pace of its modern competition, and galvanise itself for the coming decades."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this year it was announced New Line Cinema's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025</a>. Mortal Kombat 2 serves as a sequel to 2021's Mortal Kombat, and is again directed by Simon McQuoid.</p>
<p>Joining the cast for the upcoming release is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/karl-urban-reportedly-in-line-to-play-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-2">The Boys and Lord of the Rings star Karl Urban</a>, who will play Johnny Cage.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator continues to make impressive progress, and its latest version is now capable of getting in-game in yet another title.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, the emulator can now get in-game in Red Dead Redemption Remastered. The game is evidently not in a playable state, but considering the emulator was only capable of booting the game up<a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-remastered/"> two weeks ago</a>, this is impressive progress that bodes very well for the future.</p>
<p>In the video, BrutalSam also tests a few other games, including One Piece Unlimited World Red, Tomb Raider I-III Remastered, Steamworld Dig 2, Persona 5 Royal, and others. You can check out how these games run below.</p>

<p>The ShadPS4 isn't the only PlayStation 4 emulator in the works, but it has quickly become the most promising thanks to the amazing progress it has been making in a short amount of time. The emulator's progress is also getting followed closely by a lot of players as it could become the only way to finally play <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/">Bloodborne</a> on PC in the future. The emulator can currently boot the game up, but the day PC players will finally be able to participate in the hunt may not be too far off in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-starborn-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new trademark filing suggests that Starfield’s second expansion may be called ‘Starborn’.</p>



<p>First spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1817853485028725009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the new trademark was filed on July 12, 2024, and is registered by ZeniMax Media Inc.</p>



<p>For context, Starborn refers to the group of humans who have passed through Unity, which allows them to travel between universes. In the game’s story, they reveal themselves to&nbsp;Constellation&nbsp;after the&nbsp;Spacefarer&nbsp;collects enough&nbsp;Artifacts. </p>



<p>There’s no indication of when Starfield Starborn will release, as players are still eagerly waiting for a definite release date of Starfield’s first DLC, Shattered Space. Shattered Space was initially revealed before the release of Starfield and included in the game’s Premium Edition.</p>



<p>At the very least, it seems Starfield’s Starborn DLC is at least a 2025 release.</p>



<p>Starfield achieved an 83 on Metacritic for the Xbox Series X version of Starfield, whereas PC gained 85. </p>



<p>What do you think of Starfield having a second DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.</p>

<p>The new story chapters will see the various realms of reality threatened by an alternate world version of Havik, the gravelly voiced, zombie-faced C-lister of the Mortal Kombat franchise. Some other characters will appear alongside him, including a bizarro-land Noob Saibot and a gender-flipped Sektor and Cyrax. Heavens knows how they're going to make any of this sensible. Then again, the most fun part of the base game's storyline came from ascending a pyramid swarming with mash-up characters, and pulverizing said hybrids into pulp. So maybe, just maybe, the storyline doesn't matter a damn?</p>
<p>The "Khaos Reigns" DLC will come out September 24 and also include a bunch of guest characters. Like I say, the T-1000, Conan, and Ghostface will all make an appearance. A free update releasing along with the expansion will also add "animalities" to the biff 'em up. These are a zoological spin on the series' traditionally violent finishing moves, and <a href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Animality">first appeared way back in Mortal Kombat 3</a>. When you perform one, your character will transform into a gorilla, hippo, or other charismatic megafauna, and then tear your opponent asunder. The trailer shows Mileena transmogrifying into a giant preying mantis and nibbling on her foe's head, for instance. It remains unknown if Johnny Cage's kangaroo kill will reappear, but one can dream.</p>
<p>Like I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mortal-kombat-1-review">Mortal Kombat 1 review</a>, I was not keen on the Marvel-esque kliché of its storytelling. But the fighting was solid, with a fun "kameo" system that allowed for other characters to appear on screen and briefly throw a spanner into the brawl, by saving you from a hit or extending a combo. It's not my go-to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> if I'm in the mood for getting pummeled by strangers online (that's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a>), but put the comic book bloat aside and you'll find MK1 isn't too shabby.</p>

            <p>
The main Assassin's Creed reddit, subscribed to by more than 717,000 users, has taken a firm stance on the continuing backlash to Black samurai Yasuke protagonist in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ee83ow/there_is_no_debate_yasuke_was_a_samurai_if_you/">post</a> from the popular reddit's moderation team has drawn a line under the ongoing "'debate'" over whether the real-life figure of Yasuke was a samurai or not, and to what extent his depiction in Assassin's Creed Shadows will be historically accurate. 
</p>
<p>
It's a matter Ubisoft appeared to wade into last week via a vaguely-worded statement that raised eyebrows after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">apologised for "some elements" in the game's promotional materials it said had "caused concern" among some Japanese fans</a>. Now, in a lengthy statement, the moderation team says Ubisoft's statement had "exacerbated" the matter further.

<p>
"With the reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows, there has been an influx of certain individuals spilling into various communities online such as this subreddit and raising arguments about 'historical accuracy'," the Assassin's Creed reddit moderation team wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"As we are all exhausted of this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death, not to mention exacerbated by a recent official statement from Ubisoft, we would like to give a final reminder to those participating in these debates as to what exactly this franchise entails, and why there was never any point to these discussions to begin with outside of thinly veiling bad faith intent.
</p>
<p>
"Assassin's Creed is historical fiction. This means that while certain locations, events and figures may be based on reality, and can even have a slight focus on accuracy, their depictions are largely exaggerated for the sake of a more enjoyable video game. While all of our player protagonists have been fictional to date, the introduction of Yasuke has given some people the false impression that the above rule does not apply. It still does. 
</p>
<p>
"Yasuke, who is a samurai as confirmed by multiple reputable historians around the world including from Japan, may not have held as large as a role in the real world as he does in Shadows. This is okay. It is a video game. You are not meant to use Assassin's Creed as a sourcebook for actual historical knowledge - it is meant to compel you to do your own external research after immersing you in a glimpse of authenticity."
</p>
<p>
The moderation team goes on to provide an extensive series of links to a "helpful list" of historical inaccuracies in every Assassin's Creed game so far, collated by fans.
</p>
<p>
"We are not here in this community to debate on historical record," the statement continues. "Most of us understand as fans that while these games provide us a great look into what historical settings could have felt like and have fun comparing them to actual record, we do not chase accuracy within this franchise and primarily play for other reasons. 
</p>
<p>
"So if you are specifically here to leave comments about your displeasure about Yasuke's inclusion or various other inaccurate details that have been pointed out in Ubisoft's depiction of Feudal Japan, it is time to understand that this is not the place for this discussion and it never will be. Feel free to take your displeasures elsewhere, away from this franchise and its communities.
</p>
<p>
"Any further comments attempting to dispute Yasuke's societal status, disparage his inclusion in game or containing statements bordering on concern trolling for historical accuracy will be swiftly removed and met with a ban."
</p>
<p>
The post itself has now been locked due to "brigading", an update from the moderation team states.
</p>
<p>
Online discussion around Yasuke, stoked up by outraged YouTube and social media channels, has centred on the Black character's prominence in the fedual Japan-set game alongside shinobi co-star Naoe, and criticism of a particular historian Ubisoft consulted with over Yasuke's real-life background.
</p>
<p>
The debate has spilled over into the real-world, too, enough that a fringe Japanese politician requested the Japanese government comment on the matter - to seemingly no meaningful result. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1815993456579461156">thread</a> on X by Jeffrey J Hall, a university lecturer on Japanese politics, the outcome was described thus: "Foreign Ministry: it's not our concern. Education Ministry: canned answer saying games shouldn't violate 'public order and morals'. METI [Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry] declined to answer because it doesn't concern them."
</p>
<p>
"Internet culture warriors hyped up the NHK Party's questions like they were a huge thing, not understanding that Japanese government ministries aren't in the business of censoring works of historical fiction," Hall concluded. "This kind of questioning is common in Japanese politics and is often just performative. Many of these content creators did not inform their audiences that the NHK Party is a tiny party with almost zero practical political influence in Japan."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot spoke out to condemn "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Assassin's Creed Shadows' development team</a> in the wake of the game's reveal.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has also addressed the matter, and discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">how he reacted to a tweet from billionaire X and Tesla owner Elon Musk criticising diversity in game design</a>.

			<p>Starfield players know the Starborn moniker very well, as it's discussed thoroughly in the main storyline of Bethesda's latest sci-fi role-playing game. However, a trademark registered earlier this month by Bethesda (and <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1817853485028725009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by the ever-vigilant Timur222) suggests Starborn could be the title of an upcoming expansion for the game.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bethesda Game Studios is currently working on the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered</a> Space. Due to launch at some point in the Fall season for PC and Xbox Series S|X, here's its official description:</p>
<p><em>A mysterious power stirs in the city of Dazra on House Va'Ruun's hidden homeworld. Investigate a frightening cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and gear in this all-new adventure.</em></p>
<p>Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed </a>that Shattered Space will take place on a single planet, which should bring back the exploration feeling that was somewhat missing from the base game. We also learned that it is roughly as big as Fallout 4's Far Harbor, which lasted around 15 hours.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Howard also mentioned that Shattered Space would be the first in a series of 'annual story expansions'. It follows that Starborn could launch next year, with Bethesda planning to support Starfield for a long time, just like it did with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. However, those games didn't get annual expansions. Bethesda is leveling up in that regard.</p>

            <p>US workers body SAG-AFTRA says its voice actors strike could still impact projects that have been in development for over a year, including games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, despite the terms of its agreement stating they should be safe.</p>
<p>Initially, last week's shock announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> was thought to have minimal impact on games expected to release later this year, as it did not include games that commenced production before August 2023.</p>

<p>Now, however, SAG-AFTRA says all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work", intimating that it believed the strike could be more disruptive than previously suspected and impact "non-struck" games.</p>
<p>"Members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work on these titles," SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sag-aftra-strike-video-game-ai">Inverse</a>.</p>
<p>"And we know that many of our members are going to become unavailable to work on those.</p>
<p>"So while [non-struck games like GTA 6] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union."</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union announced a strike after failing to reach a deal with major video game companies over the use of AI</a> following "more than a year and a half of negotiations".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity says it stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA</a> following news of the strike, though won't be authorising a strike itself.</p>

            <p>Happy this week! I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we've learned in the process that anything that <em>resembles</em> the Maw <em>behaves</em> like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On <strong>Monday 29th July</strong>, there is nothing but sadness and desolation and desperate SOS messages from Los Angeles. On <strong>Tuesday 30th July</strong>, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-garden-path">The Garden Path</a>, an autumnal horticulture sim whose demo Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-5">enjoyed</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-landlord-sim-space-for-sale-looks-thrillingly-unsavoury">Space For Sale</a>, in which you build domed houses on unreceptive planets. Also on 30th July, the turn-based Neon Evangelism of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-seed">Arc Seed</a>, and the early access launch of free-to-play Blizzardy RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stormgate">Stormgate</a>. <strong>Wednesday 31st July</strong> has us managing planes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2289650/Mini_Airways/">Mini Airways</a>, organising frog toes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708320/Tidy_Cauldron/">Tidy Cauldron</a>, and breaking bad in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450700/Drug_Lord_Tycoon/">Drug Lord Tycoon</a> (See also: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/revisiting-dope-wars-98-for-some-ungodly-reason">Nic's recent piece on Dope Wars 98</a>). On <strong>Thursday 1st August</strong>, the chance to play travelling salesman in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a>, from the Untitled Goose Game devs. Alternatively, you could try free-to-play tactics RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526380/Sword_of_Convallaria/">Sword of Convallaria</a>, which appears to be Final Fantasy Tactics plus an undetermined quantity of gacha. And on <strong>Friday 2nd August</strong>: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">Motördoom</a>, a horde shooter which is also a Tony Hawk game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a>, a metroidvania out to steal Hollow Knight's lunch, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-goo-2">World of Goo 2</a>, sequel to the Prometheus of indie physics puzzlers, which came out shortly before I got into james gournalism <em>16 years ago</em>. Time for more sadness and desolation!</p>
<p>It's possible these are not the week's best and most interesting games. It's possible I'm lying, plying the readership with talk of indie comebacks, while quietly sliding a copy of Half-Life 3 into my trenchcoat. Only you, the intrepid gourmand of interactive entertainments, can set me straight. Let us know about any games we've missed in the comments, and find our weekly news liveblog below. Have a good one.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-new-gameplay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChinaJoy </a>2024 is in full swing, and we've got several new gameplay showcases for high-profile games like Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, courtesy of Gematsu.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is Sony's flagship game for this year. Developed by Team Asobi (formerly Japan Studio), it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during May's PlayStation Showcase event. We've since learned that it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game</a> made by the studio yet, featuring over 80 levels spanning three different worlds for a total length <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be between 12 and 15 hours. Game Director Nicolas Doucet also <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Team Asobi considered using open world design but decided against it to provide optimal variety.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5 on September 6. A PC version coming in a year or two is all but guaranteed, though, considering Sony's strategy to bring all of its first-party games to the platform in due time.</p>

<p>ChinaJoy 2024 also hosted a stage event for Phantom Blade Zero, the highly anticipated action RPG developed by Chinese studio S-GAME. <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused </a>on boss fights and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot</a> be considered a Soulslike title. Game Director and Founder Soulframe Liang told Wccftech that Phantom Blade Zero will probably still take a few years before completion:</p>
<p><em>Even for the most experienced team, completing a project like this would take several years, not to mention our team are relatively young.</em><br>
<em>We cannot yet estimate the exact time of project completion, but we will try to showcase some of the latest achievements during different stages of development. We hope everyone can continue to follow our progress and stay tuned！</em></p>

<p>In addition to Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, ChinaJoy 2024 was also the venue to showcase new projects from Chinese studios like Project: Jinyiwei, Loulan, Infinity Nikki, and Unending Dawn for the first time.

			<p>For all that F1 centres on driving talents like Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen, it is a sport that’s built on statistics. For the biggest teams, crew numbers stretch into the hundreds, with specialists focused on every aspect of the car, and the variables that can affect it, from sole components to tyre wear and aerodynamics – just look at the fine margins of tyre weight that seemingly led to this weekend’s controversial result! EA’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a> allows you to live out your driver fantasies, but what about those hoping to be the next James Vowles or wanting to channel their inner Hannah Schmitz? F1 Manager 24 lets you take control of an entire F1 team, bringing success through clever strategy, correct car setup and an eye for detail. It’s also the best entry in Frontier’s series so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1® Manager 24 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMGvWYg7crI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 takes a big step forward over last year’s entry with the arrival of Create A Team. It’s almost unbelievable that we’ve had to wait for this feature, but now that it’s here it lives up to expectations, allowing you to personalise and take true ownership of your team’s journey to the top of the podium.</p>


<p>The inclusion of real-life footage immediately makes you feel like you’re entering the world of F1, and as a newcomer to the paddock, you’re heralded with the right level of excitement. What isn’t exciting, is the very short character limit for your team name, so my dreams of operating Leighton Motorsport were immediately dashed. Come on Frontier, if you can’t input at least one of the real team names – McLaren International Ltd character counters – surely we could have had one or two more letters for custom teams?</p>
<p>Once you’ve made peace with the name your team will be sporting, you have to settle on an origin story, from living the life of a billionaire and starting your own team, to joining forces with a high-quality tech startup. It’s a nice little touch that dictates the quality of the car, facilities, drivers and staff you have access to, as well as your starting capital, bringing in a touch of narrative to a game that is ostensibly about the numbers.</p>


<p>Then it’s time for the fun stuff, selecting your drivers, and key staff members. Depending on your earlier choices, you’re going to have access to different people here, but I was able to go with an Alex Albon and Oscar Piastri pairing, while most of my technical staff were lured away from Red Bull, apart from Mercedes Bono, who’s a star in his own right. You can be right in the thick of it from the start, and it’s so appealing if you’re a fan. If you’re not, well, I’m surprised you’re still here.</p>
<p>While there’s plenty of fiction going on, the sport remains grounded in the real world, and it was interesting to note how our second season began, with moves like Lewis Hamilton’s jump to Ferrari happening in sync with the real world. That said, a few shifts like the disappearance of Perez from the grid and his replacement at Red Bull by Carlos Sainz, remain the stuff of (plausible) fantasy.</p>
<p>Progressing the calendar is your main focus between sessions, and from here there’s plenty of the cut and thrust of the F1 back office, including sponsor negotiations, staff appraisals and car development. Balancing the needs of your sponsors, and for the essential income it provides, is done in an interesting way, forcing you to balance the knock-on effect of each event against different sectors of your operation. I mostly focused on not impacting my team’s drivers, but at the expense of my other staff and the effectiveness of the facilities. Moving from being the worst team on the grid to the seventh suggest that it was a solid enough strategy.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, you get out what you put in here. F1 Manager is a very menu-heavy game, and just like the real sport, it’s all about maximising every aspect of the car, the team and the driver. If you’re turned off by the idea of clicking through multiple menus and changing different sliders by a couple of notches, then I don’t think F1 Manager 24 is the one for you.</p>
<p>That extends even further into the races themselves. The overall presentation here is fantastic for a management sim, with multiple camera angles available throughout the race, and the option to accelerate time so you can whiz through an event if you need to, with faster speeds switching from track cameras to a track map instead. However, you’re missing the point if you do. Watching the races unfold naturally, albeit at double the speed – which is a decent balance between realism and feeling like a Benny Hill sketch – while altering your driver’s strategy on the fly and adapting to this entry’s new mechanical failures is the most fun and engaging part of the game.</p>

<p>You feel like you’re in control, cementing the idea that you’re an integral part of this race team, and while it might ultimately boil down to watching a series of numbers tick along, it’s hypnotic and satisfying in equal measure. It doesn’t feel overwhelming either, letting you control as much or as little as you want. If you’re in a hurry you can simulate sessions or whole events, but it does feel you could probably be doing something else altogether if you’re not interacting with it.</p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 really does look and sound the part, and the combination of opening commentary, audio snippets and compelling visual style, make this feel as true to life as possible. It might not be as flashy as Codemasters’ F1 24, but Frontier has captured the sport with a refined eye for detail. It’s even more appealing when you watch your created team’s car zip past a Red Bull too.</p>
