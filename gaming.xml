                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is launching in early access later this week, and it's going to diverge from some of the standard conventions of action-RPG titles. While Obsidian Entertainment has already established that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-outer-worlds-2-companions-whom-you-cant-romance/1100-6534102/" data-ref-id="1100-6534102">its six companion characters can't be romanced</a>, the studio has revealed that they can actually turn on the player if you give them enough of a reason.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Expansion Pass</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), game directors Matt Singh and Brandon Adler noted that players' decisions can potentially backfire on them by alienating their companions, who may choose to attack or even attempt to kill the player under the right circumstances.</p><p>"One of the things that was really important is, we wanted these characters to feel like they're their own people," Singh said. "They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player's aligning with them, that's great. They're going to be there for you. They'll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they're going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict. That might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they'll be there for you in the end."</p><p>As an example, Adler noted that the companion character Inez is aligned with the Auntie's Choice faction. If players ignore Inez's request to stop killing members of her group, she won't just leave your team, she'll also attack the player at various points.</p><p>However, Adler added that these turns won't happen in a vacuum, and the companion characters will actually warn players about their deteriorating relationships ahead of time with requests or ultimatums. Players will have the option to try to save their relationships, and also suffer the consequences if they choose to do nothing.</p><p>Obsidian recently introduced a Moon Man plushie called a "Couch-Panion," which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-plushie-could-be-your-friend-or-kill-you-in-your-sleep/1100-6535451/" data-ref-id="1100-6535451">is the prize for winning a contest</a> running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-getting-some-pricy-customizable-xbox-controllers/1100-6535316/" data-ref-id="1100-6535316">Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers</a>, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">shared the launch times</a>, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.</p>

            <p>
For a myriad of reasons, I can't really write any particular profane curse words here, but an approximation of my feelings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdcage">Birdcage</a>, an anime as hell, "sword action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> game", it would be something like, "this game is so ******* sick, like what the ****, how the **** can one game be so ******* stylish." I'm sure you can fill in the blanks of what words I wish I could use there, but if you'll allow me, I'd also like to take the time to actually talk about why Birdcage rules so much.
</p>
<p>
Birdcage is an upcoming title from Polygon Bird Games, which consists of just two people: Giannis Milonogiannis, a comic book artist who's worked with big dogs like DC and Marvel, and Barry Topping, the composer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-killer">Paradise Killer</a>. Milonogiannis is behind all the art from the game, which is just a perfect concoction of moods and influences, coming through tightly in its recently released demo (<strong><em>big flashing lights warning</em></strong>).

<p>
Inspired by '90s arcade games, Birdcage's opening cutscenes feel just as sparse yet tantalising as the best of them. You are the pilot of a ship called the Halycon, with one goal in mind: destroy a new kind of weapon that will "end Earth's reign and birth a new universe, the World-Egg." This is delivered to you in single screen scenes with art that evokes the best JRPG classics - think a sketchier, more pixel arty Breath of Fire 4 cover kind of vibe.
</p><p>
It's the kind of game you can imagine getting an OVA straight-to-VHS adaptation that's worth $300 now and has not been released in high quality, so your only way to watch it is through a crappy rip uploaded to the Internet Archive. The story in the demo is minimal, and there's only six stages apparently, but the restraint exercised makes me curious for more, the best kind of narrative.
</p>
<p>
With your ship, you have a few combat options. You can shoot out a spread of bullets that do less damage but hit more enemies, or you can concentrate them to do more damage, the tradeoff being that you move slower (which turns into a boon in more bullet laden levels). Said ship also has a sword, a point that rules an incredible amount, that can destroy certain bullet types, can be swung around to damage certain ships, or shot out at an enemy. It's all mostly simple, yet tough as hell. You've only got three bits of health, and limited lives, so dodging every bullet is a lot more stressful than you'd think.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's an arcade mode which is just story mode without the story, and score attack where enemies infinitely spawn within a set time limit as you try to rack up some points. Real classic arcade stuff.
</p>
<p>
You can try out the demo for yourself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158550/BIRDCAGE/">Steam</a> right now, or alternatively, you can wait until November 18th for the full release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lay’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/college-students-float-on-bags-of-potato-chips-1638992763">potato chips</a> are receiving a big rebrand that makes it clear that the popular snack food is made from potatoes. That might seem silly, until you realize that according to the chip maker, nearly half of the people who buy its product didn’t know the chips were made using potatoes. Seriously.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/our-stories/story/from-potato-to-chip-the-next-chapter-of-lays">Lay’s announced plans to “revamp” the “world’s most popular potato chip”</a> and laid out what it intends to do in a press release that revealed the new chip bag design and shared the surprising statistic.</p>

 <p>“There are more than 4,000 registered potato varieties in the world, and only 10 are good enough to become a Lay’s potato chip,” explained Lay’s in a press release that mentions the word potato nearly 30 times. “Lay’s spends up to nine years creating the best potato for farmers to grow that can deliver the perfect crisp, flavor and golden glow when sliced and cooked. The potatoes’ journey from the soil to the shelf is the heart of Lay’s. But here’s the surprising part — 42% of people who enjoy Lay’s don’t realize they’re made with real, farm-grown potatoes.”</p>

 <p>Usually, I find press releases to be filled with exaggerated language and brand hype that I roll my eyes at, but yeah, no, that is indeed surprising. Nearly half of the people who buy and consume Lay’s chips don’t know they are made from…potatoes? It makes me wonder what they thought the chips were made out of and if they even had a guess or were just buying bags of salty and crispy snacks without much thought beyond “It tastes good.”</p>

 <h2>The new Lay’s chip bag</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000637409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637409">©Lay’s / PepsiCo</figcaption></figure>  <p>So to help address this problem, and also declining sales, the chip maker is rebranding its most famous product. I mean, this doesn’t seem like Lay’s problem to me, but it’s nice they are trying something. You’ll notice that the new bag design has potatoes on it. I mean, the old design <em>literally</em> had a potato transforming into a chip on the front of it, but apparently that wasn’t working. The new bag looks more rustic with wood paneling artwork, and even says, in big black letters, “Made with real potatoes.” Lay’s really wants you all to know that these are potato chips. Lay’s also says it’s removing artificial flavors and colors from its popular potato chip brand in the United States, too. I assume this is connected to U.S. Health Secretary and America’s 14th weirdest maniac, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-to-announce-phasing-out-of-artificial-food-dyes">his ongoing war against artificial flavors and other chemicals he doesn’t like</a>.</p>

 <p>“The new visual identity celebrates the humble, farm-grown potato — where every Lay’s potato chip starts — and heroes the ingredients that deliver the unmatched flavor consumers have always loved,” explained Alexis Porter, PepsiCo’s Vice President of Marketing, Global Lay’s, in a press release. You can almost hear the desperation from Porter when talking about how these chips are made from potatoes.</p> <p>Will all of this work? Who can say? It does feel like more than ever, the world is slipping into accepted stupidity, while folks seem overall less interested in learning. And if you do try to learn anything, you just end up reading AI-generated summaries filled with nonsense. Or maybe people just assume everything they buy in a store is fake and overly processed plastic pretending to be food. Probably a bit of column A and column B. I’m feeling kind of sad about the future. Seems like the perfect time to curl up on my couch and eat some chips. Wonder what these things are made out of?</p>

              <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">wrapped up today</a> and Valve has revealed the most downloaded demos from the event. Big winners included <em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, <em>Everwind</em>, and <em>YAPYAP</em>. If you’ve never heard of any of those, this is your chance to catch up on tomorrow’s hit Steam games before they’re out.</p> <p>Here are the top 10 demo downloads during the latest Steam Next Fest in order of most unique players:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Half Sword</em></strong></a> (medieval swordplay sim)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></strong></a> (turn-based strategy)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/"><strong><em>YAPYAP</em></strong></a> (magic comedy crew-like)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4021860?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Final Sentence</em></strong></a> (typing battle royale)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong></a> (co-op horror adventure)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4028270?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Everwind</em></strong></a> (co-op survival RPG)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Midnight Walkers</em></strong></a> (zombie extraction shooter)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810880/THE_CUBE_SAVE_US?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Cube, Save Us</em></strong></a> (extraction MMO)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Misery</em></strong></a> (post-apocalyptic co-op survival)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179350/Long_Drive_North_CoOp_RV_Simulator?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Long Drive North: Co-Op RV Simulator</em></strong></a> (open world survival)</li> </ul> <p>Online co-op and survival sims still reign supreme, though it’s nice to see <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> having a mini-breakout moment in 2025. “This is the heroes game I have been waiting for ever since heroes 3,” wrote one Steam reviewer about the demo. I was never an <em>HoMM</em> guy growing up, but I like strategy RPGs and enjoyed what I tried of the Early Access build that came out earlier this month.</p>

 <p>Here are some other games from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed">larger top 50 Next Fest demo list</a> that caught my eye. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923350/Ultimate_Sheep_Raccoon/"><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em></a> is a multiplayer PVP <em>Trials</em>-like. Think 2D side-scrolling <em>Mario Kart</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/"><em>Master of Command</em></a> is a history buff’s historical strategy game that trades neat graphics for the nitty-gritty detail of regiment customization and supply line management. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170150"><em>Cairn</em></a> is an open-world atmospheric climbing sim. It looks like the indie version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> meets <em>Death Stranding</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4040960/Tears_of_Metal_Demo/"><em>Tears of Metal</em></a> is a co-op hack-and-slash roguelike. It’s giving <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> in the art style of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>. Finally there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/"><em>Skate Story</em></a>, a skateboard RPG in which you grind through a shadow realm to liberate tortured souls. I keep hearing great things.</p> <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest may be over now, but most of these games still have free demos you can download if you want to check them out and wishlist them ahead of their launch windows. Because as we all know, Steam users don’t already have way too much to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fifteen years ago, when director Guillermo del Toro was scheduled to drop by Criterion’s New York office for a project, a casual email from the social media team sparked an unexpected tradition. On a whim, someone floated the idea of snapping a photo of the director inside their office closet—a quirky little nook where guests on business, as a courtesy, were invited to pick out a couple of films as a parting gift. Knowing how generous the <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> director was, <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/author/307-peter-becker?srsltid=AfmBOoo2LTumpnUOL8gzYTRmqIxhIVjHvA-evBpSHF5umLRPavJbqDxd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Becker</a>, Criterion’s president, figured del Toro wouldn’t just be game—he might even let them film the whole thing. Hell, maybe folks on “the Facebook” would get a modest kick out of watching him rummage through their spine-numbered treasure trove of films.</p><p>And sure enough, Guillermo got back to them, saying, “Sure, let’s do it!”</p><p>“He totally understood what we were doing, and he understood why we were doing it.” Becker told me, still sounding amazed nearly two decades later. “He generously went through, picked a whole bunch of stuff in very little time, saying just a few words about each thing he put in his bag.”</p><p>And just like that, what started off as a one-off video of del Toro rifling through a closet of movies served as the blueprint for Criterion’s most beloved ritual: the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;si=ENAMR2hDowDvEm0B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Criterion Closet Picks</a> video series.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Guillermo del Toro - DVD Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/49Al7eYy6sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Over 300 videos later, Closet Picks has become cinephiles’ version of unboxing therapy meets NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert. Featuring everyone from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tG_cBdvo2c&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=164&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUou0rghddc&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=181&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_rAKw7q6RY&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=215&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cate Blanchett</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBpffnfc3AI&amp;list=PL7D89754A5DAD1E8E&amp;index=109&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle Monáe</a>, all whispering sweet nothings about their favorite films while raiding Criterion’s curated stash of classic and contemporary films like kids in a candy store. All the while, putting thousands of viewers onto the next film to queue into their backlog.&nbsp;</p><p>To celebrate those fans, Criterion <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8721-on-the-road-with-the-criterion-mobile-closet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took the closet on the road</a> last year, allowing fans to line up in multiple cities across the United States—as well as Canada for TIFF—to live out their own star-for-a-day fantasy picking out films, posing for a Polaroid, and walking away with their physical media finds like it was 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>For its 40th anniversary, the mobile Criterion Closet made its seventh stop in my hometown of Chicago, just in time for the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8914-next-stop-the-criterion-mobile-closet-at-the-chicago-international-film-festival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago International Film Festival</a>. Naturally, I joined the dedicated Criterion fans waiting in line since 9:30 a.m., despite a light drizzle and a head full of questions for Becker, whom I had bumped into the day before when he broke the bad news that the line had closed hours earlier on the Friday before. At the time, I didn’t realize I was casually chatting with the president of the whole shebang.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for my own pilgrimage into the hot commodity mobile closet, I met back up with Becker, who recognized me from the day before, and he agreed to my blog-brained inquiry for an impromptu interview. The first was what even inspired the idea to film people cherry-picking their favorite movies from their closet.&nbsp;</p><p>“We found that some of the best conversations we had with people—even if we had just interviewed them for two hours beforehand—happened in the closet at the very end of their visits,” Becker said. “People are relaxed and they’re looking up and they’re being reminded of movies that they love and it triggers memories.”</p><p>While del Toro had served as the blueprint for what the Criterion Closet Picks are today, Becker told me they were pretty shy about asking more creatives to do a video with them because they didn’t want to create collaborators on the spot for what was ostensibly marketing their products for them.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were pretty sparing about who we asked, so the earliest closet videos are some of the people who were closest to the company—personally, emotionally. People that we can turn to when we’re trying something new,” Becker said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bill Hader's DVD Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/348qOuXOAXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The earliest of Criterion Closet’s visitors included the likes of Emmy award-winning actor Bill Hader and French director <a href="https://youtu.be/s7Jx0Pjq_kQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agnès Varda</a>. Unlike today’s Criterion Closet format, where the camera stayed in a fixed position as its guests perused the shelves, they were boxed in between on either side of their shoulders and backs. Becker says the old format had metal shelves, and the camera was in the wrong place. Mainly, he didn’t know where to put it while he himself was recording guests raiding their closet. Meanwhile, Becker tried his damnedest hand-holding the camera while trying to get out of people’s way. After a while, the tide turned, and guests started asking Criterion to shoot them browsing their closet.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve always aspired for Criterion to be a hub in film culture—a common place that can be shared by filmmakers, audiences, restorers, scholars, and critics,” Becker said. “To be a meeting place for people who are coming to movies for all kinds of different reasons.”</p><p>Becker’s favorite Closet Pick videos are the early ones—mostly because he was behind the camera for them. But his standout moment came when Rose Byrne, fresh from her Criterion closet experience, chatted about it on Late Night with Seth Meyers. The two laughed over the charming absurdity of the fact that it was, true to its name, “just a closet.” For Becker, seeing their shared enthusiasm reflected in everyday fans attending their roadshow was a gratifying reminder that the love of cinema can bridge even the insurmountable gap between stars and audiences.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Rose Byrne on Her Intense Role in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, Talks Working with Conan O'Brien" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POoi1rhMZNY?start=347&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“We honor the filmmakers every day with their work, but the audiences that care about movies the way that we care about movies, sign up for our streaming service, and buy our discs, we couldn’t do this without them,” Becker told me. “So the mobile closet was built as a tribute to them.”</p><p>The mobile Criterion Closet itself was a snug squeeze—about two and a half shoulders wide, which Becker assured attendees was a faithful replica of the genuine article, minus the ceiling height (a concession to van physics). Not that anyone minded. Each time a group would emerge from the back of the van, they did so like Russell Crowe in <em>Gladiator</em>, hoisting their film picks overhead and basking in the cheers from the line like they’d just won the Cannes Palme D’Or in New City’s mall kiosk parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Having waited in line for more than five and a half hours, Becker highlighted that the true essence of the mobile Criterion Closet wasn’t the spectacle of the truck (or the 40% discount for attendees)—it was the line itself. For Becker and the Criterion team, bringing the closet to Chicago wasn’t about mimicking the celebrity experience. It was about transforming a queue into a conversation, encouraging spontaneous community. It was about film lovers stepping out from behind their screens, connecting in real time, and forging bonds over a mutual passion for cinema.</p><p>“When we started the mobile closet, we didn’t realize how much the line was going to be the point,” Becker said. “What happens in the Closet videos often is that people are reminded of movies, and often, they’re reminded of who they saw them with, who recommended them to them, or who has always wanted to see this movie they haven’t seen. We really had come to understand that film is a mode of connection, and we hadn’t anticipated the degree to which that was going to be true at this event, too.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ayo Edebiri’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LvIlPvrjGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Because hundreds of people turned out to the event, Criterion folks quickly recognized they couldn’t handle the Closet Picks individually. Instead, they grouped people up. And from there, they unconsciously fostered icebreakers amongst folks who’d be spending hours waiting together to talk about their shared love of films.&nbsp;</p><p>“It gives people permission to talk to each other and compare notes,” Becker said. “The mountain of cinema is enormous. There’s a million pathways, a million trials that people have taken. So it’s a chance for people to compare notes about the things that they’ve discovered&nbsp; on their own journeys—their own adventures as moviegoers—and for us to hear from them too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Proof that the line was the load-bearing half of the magic: my partner and I became fast friends with our queue comrades, Kato and Dan. Between swatting away bees drawn to our collectively enticing shampoo-coffee aura, we immediately swapped Letterboxd and Instagram handles like business cards at a mixer. Over the course of our wait, we strategized our three film pick titles each, with military precision—plus back-up plans in case our top choices got snatched. Deep cuts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Friedkin's <em>Sorcerer</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%26_Basketball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Prince-Bythewood’s <em>Love &amp; Basketball</em></a> earned mutual nods of respect.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yes, we've already made plans to catch a movie together. <span></span><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most rewarding parts of the event for Becker was seeing people naturally form groups—be they clusters of three or five—and bond over their favorite films. After spending hours in line together, it became hard for him to tell who had arrived as friends and who had become bosom buddies while waiting in line.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a sense of community. I think that’s fairly special—to feel like you’re fostering a sense of community among people. As we get older in life, it’s increasingly rare to find ourselves surrounded by complete strangers with whom we know to a certainty we share a passionate interest,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: “Everybody here really loves movies in a way that is important enough to them that they're willing to sacrifice some of their precious time and freedom to be here and wait in line. We may all have more in common with these strangers that we're in line with than we do with some of our good friends and relatives, who we love and certainly wouldn't trade them for strangers in line, necessarily. But it is really nice every once in a while to be surrounded by people that you're like, ‘Ah, I see you. I can feel what you're feeling about that film,’ or ‘ I’m grateful for you sharing your experience with me for these movies.’”</p><p>Plus, our collective anguish over Michael Bay’s <em>Armageddon </em>being sold out led to the real jaw-dropping reveal when Becker, keeping folks company while waiting in line, casually informed us that Kato’s would-be pick sparked an internal debate at Criterion HQ over whether it should join its catalogue. Fortunately, Bay maximalism prevailed, and the film proved to be so popular that it vanished within the first half-day of the Criterion Closet roadshow. Womp womp.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="John David Washington and Malcolm Washington’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tc0JZz6hFM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly minted Paul Thomas Anderson devotee</a> and a lifelong evangelist for Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles’ 2002 drama film, <em>City of God</em>, I couldn’t leave well enough alone, having reworked my chicken scratch Criterion Closet Picks list and spiralling into mild despair over their absence from Criterion’s 1,200 plus titles, I had to ask: how does Criterion decide which films get invited to the cool kids table?&nbsp;</p><p>“We never wanted to be a housekeeping seal of approval for movies. It’s not that there aren’t great movies that are not a part of the collection. It’s not that every movie in the collection is beloved by every member of the Criterion staff. Film is a very subjective passion, so we’re constantly fielding—from within the staff and from the outside world—people’s passionate pitches for what we should release,” Becker said.&nbsp;</p><p>To give a look under the hood, Becker explained that Criterion has an internal acquisitions team that includes people working on theatrical, disc, and Criterion Channel programming acquisitions, as well as a curatorial advisory board that it calls upon anytime to learn more about a film and determine where it would fit in. This would include getting the lowdown about a film from a culture that staff aren’t well versed in, as well as curating a list of films that fit a certain vein they want to bolster in their library, and tracking down those hidden gems. As such, Becker told me that Criterion has a long list of films that we’re pursuing at any given time in addition to a huge, rolling backlog of movies it already has rights to that it hasn’t gotten around to releasing just yet. This would include films like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_and_Nights_in_the_Forest_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satyajit Ray’s<em> Days and Nights in the Fores</em></a><em>t</em>, which took 11 years for Criterion, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.film-foundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Heritage Foundation in India</a>, to combine forces and complete the restoration of the 1920s Indian Bengali melodrama.&nbsp;</p><p>Becker explained that bringing new titles into the Criterion fold can be a years-long process, especially when restorations are involved. Films with poorly preserved elements often require extensive work and patience, making some releases a slow but deliberate labor of love. That being said, some projects culminate quicker than others, as was the case with Sean Baker’s Mikey Madison-led Academy Award-winning film, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/anora-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anora</em></a>. Which, as Becker recounts, was a film Criterion was working on before it received all the awards because of its admiration for Baker’s work and belief in the film, which accelerated its physical release schedule from Criterion.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Simon Pegg’s Closet Picks" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIYr2eAlazo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Becker added that Criterion’s selection process isn’t purely curatorial, because it is not just about being able to choose any film at any given time. Securing the rights and locating the necessary materials are just part of the equation. Even when they have the legal clearance, they might have to wait until a filmmaker isn’t busy working on a film to collaborate. Likewise, the path to a release often involves a complex mix of timing, logistics, and having the free time to partner up—all things Becker finds to be the secret sauce to what makes Criterion special.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think that’s part of what makes the whole collection so rich—it doesn’t reflect any single curatorial perspective. But it is the product of a bunch of genuinely engaged people who wholeheartedly discuss what the best use of our time right now would be,” Becker said. “We’re trying to make the best choices we can for an audience that has rich and eclectic tastes. So, we would never dump a whole bunch of releases from one filmmaker, or just because it was from one studio, all at once. We’re always trying to put together a mix of films, mixing up classics, contemporary, silent, sound, black and white, international, Hollywood, [and] independent, all together month after month, creating a varied diet for people.”<br></p><p>When I brought up my dismay that <em>City of God</em> and <em>Magnolia </em>hadn’t yet made it into the Criterion Collection, Becker graciously encouraged fans everywhere to keep sending in suggestions, reminding movie lovers that Criterion still has “plenty of work to do.” With any luck, taking the mobile Criterion Closet on the road will pave the way for long-overlooked gems and cult classics to finally earn their place in its spine-numbered pantheon.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what we know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on my Switch 2 since it was first released and have loved every minute of it. The game takes place entirely in Lumiose City and I've found that it runs beautifully on the new console. Whether you're catching Pokémon in the wild zones or diving into intense battles, everything looks crisp and gameplay is perfectly smooth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually need to own a Switch 2 to play Pokémon Legends: Z-A, though. The standard Switch version is now available for $10 less than its Switch 2 counterpart. So if you're a Poké fan who hasn't yet taken the plunge and purchased the latest console, you don't have to miss out on the latest Pokémon adventure. The real question is: How well does the Switch 1 version actually run? IGN had the chance to play the game on both consoles side-by-side and it would seem the older console is quite capable of running the game – with the exception of some frame rate loss. You can check out our comparison below to see for yourself how the two versions of the game stack up against each other.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Upgrade?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we noted in our comparison video, the differences between the two versions of the game are noticeable, but not so vast that you really <em>need</em> to upgrade to play the game. If you want the best possible gameplay experience with the sharpest possible visuals, then I'd say it's absolutely worth upgrading to the Switch 2. If you don't want to dish out the $450 for a new console, however, the Switch 1 version of the game will work just fine. The environments will be a little less detailed and some of the Pokémon may look a bit stilted in their movements, but overall the experience will still be fun.</p><div catalogid="f068ae83-e47c-49c5-b680-e7171e09803f" id="225667"><div id="225667" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who did upgrade to the Switch 2, I'd say the value in such an upgrade is more about future games than this current in-between period. Nintendo will continue to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a> on both consoles, but eventually the older hardware won't be able to handle the latest releases. This has already been the case for games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, which are both Switch 2 exclusives. And while <em>this</em> Pokémon game is available on both consoles, I can almost guarantee that the next mainline game in the series won't be able to run on the original Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This brings some added value to something like the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Bundles">Switch 2 bundle</a> because it gets you the Switch 2 version of the game at a slight discount when you buy the bundle alongside it. So even though Pokémon Legends: Z-A doesn't necessarily require an upgrade, it's still a potential reason to purchase the next generation console. This is especially true when you consider that Nintendo has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-us-price-rises-for-original-switch-warns-price-rises-for-switch-2-games-and-the-nso-membership-may-be-necessary-in-the-future">already raised the price of the original Switch</a> and warned that the price of the Switch 2 will also likely increase down the line.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">You can always purchase a Switch 2 upgrade later</h3></div><div catalogid="53fafc1c-dc52-4e84-9598-afe719211c50" id="222303"><div id="222303" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A (Switch 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are planning on playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the original Switch, it's worth noting that you can choose to purchase the Switch 2 upgrade for the game down the line. If you start playing the Switch 1 version and end up purchasing a Switch 2 later on, all you need to do is purchase the $10 upgrade pack to access better graphics and performance. Considering the cost of the Switch 2 version is only $10 more than the Switch 1 edition, you won't be paying more by taking this route.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 20, 2025 6:37 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/should-you-upgrade-to-a-nintendo-switch-2-to-play-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

The Nintendo Dual Screen! Or Nintendo DS, as it was actually known. There's a console that has practically no relevance to this site, except for right now, because of a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dementium-the-ward">Dementium: The Ward</a>. For those that haven't heard of it, this is one of the incredibly few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games available on the handheld console, nowadays a bit of a cult classic because who on earth thought it would be a good idea to do that. It was also pitched as a Silent Hill game, a point we'll come back to because the big thing here is that it's making its way to Steam later this month.
</p>
<p>
Here's the concept: you wake up in a hospital, you've got no memories, and there's nasty monsters you have to defend yourself from. On the original DS, you had to use the touch screen to look around, and you needed to use the D-Pad to move. This obviously sounds like a bit of a tricky control scheme, though it looks like it'll be your standard first-person affair in the PC release. One thing in the DS' favour that will be missing however is that you could also write down notes in a notebook using the touchscreen.

<p>
I do wonder if these changes will rob the game of something. It's not a completely new port, the game is already available on Switch and PS4/PS5, so these changes have already taken place, but I question if the lack of friction from the finicky sounding DS controls makes the experience flatter. Though, I do appreciate that it's generally retained its original visuals. Death to revisionist remasters!
</p><p>
Anyway, that Silent Hill connection! A few years back Jools Watsham, the co-founder of Renegade Kid, developer of Dementium, shared that the studio had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/dementium-the-ward-was-pitched-to-konami-as-a-silent-hill-ds-game">pitched the game to Konami about making it a Silent Hill entry</a>. According to Watsham, Konami were "kind enough to meet with us, but the meeting only lasted a few minutes and ended with their [representative] saying they wouldn't let a team like us handle the Silent Hill license." Rough! But looking at Dementium, even if it is a cult classic, it's probably for the best ultimately.
</p>
<p>
Mostly I think this thing is a neat little curiosity, as it's not very often you see DS games ported off of the console given the complexity of adapting dual screen gameplay. Normally you get remakes like The World Ends With You. In any case, if you're interested in picking up the seasonally appropriate Dementium: The Ward, it's due out later this month on October 27th via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3909960/Dementium_The_Ward/">Steam</a>.

              <p>The innovative and fondly remembered <i>FEAR</i> turns 20 this year, having been released on October 18, 2005. The game arrived on PC (and later PS3 and Xbox 360) as a thrilling mix of first-person-shooter gunplay and survival horror, incorporating exhilarating bullet-time mechanics and playing with your sense of reality when you least expected it. It remains a hell of a good time, with smart computer-controlled enemies and a mysterious little girl who will haunt your dreams. Its sequel, <i>Project Origin</i>, is a serviceable 360-era shooter with a…disturbing sexual assault scene at the end. As for <i>FEAR 3</i>, well, I’m sure someone likes it.</p> <p>If you haven’t played these games or have been meaning to add them to your library, you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/12357/">grab the whole collection on Steam</a> for just over five dollars from now until October 23, 2025, making it a perfect way to jump into these shooter/horror games in time for Halloween.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Warner Bros. Cancels <i>Wonder Woman</i> Game And Shuts Down <i>Shadow Of Morder </i>Studio</a></p> <p>Developed by Monolith (<a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">RIP</a>), <i>FEAR</i> puts you in the role of a “First Encounter Assault Recon” soldier tasked with stopping some out-of-control telepathically controlled soldiers. Along the way, you unravel the mysteries behind some warped experiments involving psychics and cloning.</p>

 <p>The series’ use of bullet time isn’t just about looking cool; it’s a pretty essential tool for overcoming some of the overwhelming forces you’re up against. And while it definitely feels powerful and awesome to use, it isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card, especially on harder difficulties. You need to be mindful of when and how you use it.</p> <p>The original remains an iconic game of the 2000s era, with a sequel that’s well worth your time if the universe speaks to you. Sadly, <i>FEAR 3</i> (stylized as <i>F3AR</i> 🙄) was a victim of the co-op shovelware trend that was particularly insidious during the 360 era. I do recall a handful of decent moments in some of the levels, but it’s a very skippable game if you’ve had your fill by the end of <i>FEAR 2</i>’s DLC. Normally I wouldn’t advise anyone to buy it, but seeing as the whole series including the DLC is on sale on Steam as a package deal for a little over five bucks, I’d say it’s worth having this one in your collection to get the other, better ones. Say hi to Alma for me.</p>

                <p>Greek mythology has been around for thousands of years and its traditions have inspired artists working in nearly every medium. What brings me joy is that each writer, visual artist, director--or in the case of Hades 2, a team of game developers--can explore a unique vision of the characters and events they choose to highlight. With the sequel to its popular hack-and-slash roguelite Hades, Supergiant Games explores the worlds of Greek gods from the perspective of Melinoe, the princess of the Underworld.</p><p dir="ltr">As the playable protagonist of Hades 2, Melinoe shows players a new side of life in the Underworld. Unlike her brother Zagreus, the young witch didn’t grow up with her family in the main palace. She instead lives in a ramshackle camp on the outskirts of Hades’ domain. The distance between her and her loved ones is palpable, and her only connection to her family is a single drawing enshrined in Melinoe’s make-shift room. The game starts when Melinoe, brooding yet powerful, decides to save her family from the Titan of time, Kronos, and finally close the gap that’s always separated them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Yet Hades 2 is far from the only modern reinterpretation that hones in on the women of Greek mythology, and Melinoe’s plights soon reminded me of another story that follows a Greek goddess and witch: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Circe-Madeline-Miller/dp/0316556327?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Madeline Miller's Circe</a>. Published in 2018, this retelling follows the story of the goddess Circe, a witch who was banished to the island of Aeaea by Zeus. If you’ve read The Odyssey, you might know the character as the duplicitous sorceress who transformed Odysseus’ men into pigs. However, Miller’s book gives the reader the chance to imagine the events from <em>her </em>side of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">If you really like Hades 2--and if you are at all interested in the witches of Greek mythology or reading stories that aren’t only about violent dude-bros starting wars--Circe is required reading. I don’t just say this because it’s easy to read and incredibly entertaining; The book also deepened my appreciation of Hades 2 <em>and</em> helped me understand where the story told in the game could have explored certain themes with more depth.</p><p dir="ltr">In Circe, witchcraft is seen as a threat to the higher gods. Unlike the Olympians, who derive their power from their bloodlines, witchcraft draws its strength from the earth. Any person, god, or goddess can harness this power through constant toil and practice. To become a strong witch, Circe grinds--and I mean this literally because she is constantly using her mortar and pestle to process herbs and flowers--day after day in her kitchen, honing her elixirs. What culminates is a very feminine power--one that grows with the steady housewife-like work of maintaining a garden and pantry.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to Circe in the novel, Melinoe must toil repeatedly in order to collect herbs and flowers that upgrade her powers and camp. As a player, I too began to feel like a witch as I honed my powers--learning how to play the game better and slowly collecting resources I needed to upgrade my attacks and stats. Still, Melinoe’s journey is quite different from Circe’s. Her main source of power comes from the other Olympians, who upgrade her sorcery with various boons and stat buffs.</p><p dir="ltr">Melinoe is also the daughter of Hades. Thougher father discourages her quest, he still provides her aid in the form of character upgrades and resources. Playing as Melinoe doesn’t feel like navigating the world as an ostracized witch. Instead, every Olympian meets her with a smile or some chipper quip. The great Zeus--a god known for being a perpetrator of sexual violence--greets her with a chuckle and lends her his power at a moment's notice. Melinoe, unlike the goddesses in Circe’s world, gets to choose her suitor.</p><p dir="ltr">Supergiant Games’ take on the story casts a shiny veneer on the world of Greek mythology. This feels odd at points because, as other critics have pointed out, the stories of Greek <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hades-ii/hades-iis-ill-defined-unserious-world-undermines-the-depth-and-power-of-mythology" rel="nofollow ">mythology typically portray the brutal nature of the gods</a>. Still, the overall cheeriness makes sense given Hades 2 is more-or-less a fun dating simulator with compelling hack-and-slash gameplay. But even given that, it made me feel like Supergiant copy-and-pasted its popular formula with a female protagonist without doing the deep work of trying to imagine how a Greek myth might be different when viewed through a women’s perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, Circe is a lesser god in every sense of the term. She’s not stereotypically attractive compared to other goddesses, so she can’t be married off (which is how her value is defined in the world of the gods). She’s the daughter of a Titan, so she’s considered to be a tier below the Olympians on Mount Olympus. She doesn’t have the inherent raw power of her father Helios, a sun god and who regularly lashes out against her. <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" rel="nofollow ">Unlike Hades 2</a>, Circe is fundamentally a story about transformation--of a woman who finds her own source of power to defy the hierarchy of the gods.</p><p>I don’t think every story about a woman needs to be hard, or marred by some sort of trauma. Hades 2 feels like good, somewhat shallow, fun. I can eat up the gameplay like popcorn and romance hot characters. It's fun to play and I’m glad we have both kinds of stories. But if you want a story that really sinks its teeth into the deep--and very oftentimes difficult--lives Greek witches, then you should definitely give Miller’s Circe a read.</p>

You might already own most of these, but I promise most of you will find something worth picking up in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/">eShop</a>‘s latest fire sale.</p> <p>Here’s just a sample:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Paradise Killer</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>What The Golf?</em></strong> – $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></strong> – $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Moonlighter: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $4.34 (85 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>OlliOlli World</em> </strong>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Spiritfarer</em></strong> – $4.50 (85 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> – The Final Cut</em> – $12 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em></strong>– $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inscryption</em> </strong>– $7 (65 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $5 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></strong> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hotline Miami Collection</em></strong> – $5 (80 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inside</em></strong> – $2 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></strong> – $6.24 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>– $8.50 (66 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster</em></strong> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></strong> – $18 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Civilization VI</em></strong> – $6 (80 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A few special shout-outs. If you don’t have <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s a top-notch deck-building roguelike that you won’t be able to put down. <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, a loot shooter roguelike, is a similarly irresistible timesink. <em>Inside</em>, meanwhile, is an excellent cinematic platformer adventure game and, in my opinion at least, one of the best games ever made. It doesn’t get enough credit. Only $2? A steal!</p> <p>Finally, <em>Digimon Cybersleuth</em> is an incredibly meaty JRPG for just $5 (the series latest entry <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341">came out this fall</a>), and $15 is a great price for <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, a wonderfully inventive and surprising visual novel/strategy game mash-up from Vanillaware.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> gets its biggest discount yet</h2> <p>There are actually some decent Switch 2 deals right now, too. They’re nowhere near as good as the ones for games on the OG hardware, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077: The Ultimate Edition</em> in particular is just $40 until November 1. That’s 43 percent off the list price, which isn’t bad at all for a port that only arrived in June. It runs surprisingly well on Switch 2 and is a decent way to catch up on the best sci-fi open-world RPG of the decade (it also supports cross-saves if you already started on another platform).</p> <p>What else is on sale on the Switch 2 at the moment?<em> Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> is just $30 right now (40 percent off) and GOTY contender <em>Split Fiction</em> is just $40 (20 percent off). The Switch 2 port of <em>EA Sports Madden NFL 26</em> isn’t the best but it’s currently $20 off the standard price. So is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, a very solid lifestyle sim RPG that arrived back with the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 has already set a world record, thanks to Xbox, helicopters, and a gigantic TV screen.</p>



<p>Releasing on October 21st, the newest entry in the Ninja Gaiden franchise is shaping up to be quite the title. With the help of PlatinumGames and Xbox, Team Ninja finally made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new mainline entry</a> after almost thirteen years. The game, which features two protagonists, Ryu and newcomer Yakumo, plans to bring the epic 3D fights to the new generation. Luckily, thanks to Xbox and a few outliers, the title is already setting a pretty impressive world record.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQje3P-QW58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video released by Xbox</a>, a world record attempt was made for the largest helicopter video game display flown in Miami Beach, Florida. With the help of Team Ninja’s community manager, Emmanuel “Master” Rodriguez, and rapper Swae Lee, they played Ninja Gaiden 4 in a helicopter. The 26-foot wide display was being flown by another helicopter piloted by Heli-D. It took place 20 m² (215 ft² 40 in²) in the air. Luckily, Guinness World Records bestowed Team Ninja and Xbox <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1980266739947499719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the world record</a>.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4, set to launch on Xbox Game Pass, has shown a lot since it’s February reveal. With previews of the title calling it a return to form, fans may be in for quite the treat. While the world record isn’t for it’s sales or gameplay feats, it doesn’t make it any less impressive. On that note, Xbox also has a first-party title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, releasing next week, making for two major titles for the company in October. Plus, both are playable on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a>, so you can enjoy them on the go whereever you are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today's AWS Outage <a href="https://wccftech.com/aws-outage-snaps-chatgpt-fortnite-down/">took down about half of the internet</a>, with apps and services across industries suffering issues throughout the day. Thankfully, we're starting to see the service slowly crawl back to life, which means that major gaming services that were taken down, like Fortnite, Roblox, and PSN are starting to recover.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Epic Games is reporting "<em>All Systems Operational</em>" <a href="https://status.epicgames.com/">on its service status website</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">Epic Games Store</a>, Fortnite, Rocket League, and Unreal Engine. Roblox is still reporting the issue as an "<em>Active Incident</em>" at the top of <a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/history/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d">its service status page</a>, though the last update on the timeline of the issue does state that AWS has informed Roblox it is back online and operational.</p>



<p>Regarding the PlayStation Network (PSN), PlayStation is <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">also reporting that all of its services are up and running</a>, and EA is also reporting its services across all of its games, including Battlefield 6, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/">are back online</a>, after players were reporting issues seemingly caused by the AWS outage.</p>



<p>The actual <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS Service page</a> is currently only reporting "<em>Impacted</em>" service in North Virginia, with other regions all listed as being operational. That said, if you do continue to encounter connection issues when trying to matchmaker in a game or even just connect to the PlayStation Store, and you've already ruled out your own internet as being the issue, then there might still be some lingering issues.</p>



<p>Hopefully, any outages will be cleared up soon, and these signs of recovery are already an indication that anyone looking to get some gaming time in today shouldn't have a problem, even if you're planning to play online.</p>

              <p>Canada’s Fan Expo is the nation’s largest geek-themed convention, attracting the crowds for its comics, sci-fi, horror, anime and gaming events, alongside big-name guests and their autograph-hunting acolytes. It also draws in a massive number of cosplayers, and where cosplay appears so does <em>Kotaku</em>‘s crack team of photographers from Mineralblu. We’ve put together a gallery of some of the best and most intriguing fits from the recent convention.</p> <p>2025’s Fan Expo was not short on big-name celebrities. Appearing at the event were the likes of <em>Star Wars’ </em>John Boyega, Tyler Hoechlin (aka the best Superman), the legendary Juliet Lewis, and <em>the</em> Michael J. Fox. (It’s worth noting that <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/celebrities/">next year’s event</a> has already managed to line up all four hobbits from the original&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies.) But we push such famous people aside, uninterested in their shiny faces, because we want to see the people dressing up as other famous people: the cosplayers.</p> <p>Mineralblu have sent us over a great mix, with some (now) traditional appearances from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, some classics like a great Princess Leia, and some old-school <em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, along with the outright unusual such as a Dry Bowser. Click on to see the fully gallery of amazing outfits.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-so-good-i%E2%80%99m-worried-it-will-completely-take-over-my-life.1329829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was hanging on for dear life this weekend. I spent about 13 hours in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ “Server Slam,” a test of the game’s servers and overall game stability ahead of its release on October 30, and it’s clear that the game clicked with me so well, I might hardly leave my apartment anymore. Farewell social life and other hobbies; <i>Arc Raiders</i> is nearly here and I don’t know if I can resist its call.</p> <p>A PvPvE extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> makes for a rough experience, but also a thrilling one. It is also, clearly, the multiplayer game I’ve been searching for ever since it was announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-dmz-beta-warzone-dead-activision-1851066541"><i>Call of Duty</i>’s DMZ was headed for a slow, un-updated death</a>. So allow me to tell you of the unbelievable thrill that was <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a hostile game. That’s the point</h2>  <p>There’s no way around this: Extraction shooters are just mean. And <i>Arc Raiders</i> is <i>nasty</i>.</p> <p>The lone map provided during the Server Slam was replete with hiding spots from which you could plan an ambush. Though you can’t lay prone, it’s pretty easy to hide in bushes, and the interiors of buildings have their fair share of corners you can exploit. Survival is about keeping your head on a swivel and your ears perpetually open for random sounds that can signal the presence of a threat before you can see it.</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, like many other extraction shooters, sticks you right in the midst of a fight-or-flight response and exploits that tension for a one-of-a-kind dopamine rush if you make it out alive, and one hell of a come-down should you fail. No, it’s not fun when you lose all your shit from a kill you could never see coming; yet somehow you need to push past that to find “fun.” It’s not for everyone.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9wwpk/when_your_best_isnt_good_enough/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Arc Raiders</i> is mean</a> in a way that a simple battle royale or team deathmatch just isn’t. You can die so quickly and, true to the genre’s conventions, death puts you at risk of losing your best gear. It often doesn’t feel fair; that’s a tough pill to swallow. Don’t worry, though; plenty of mean people will eventually get what they deserve in a later round when they inevitably push their luck too far. That’s just what this game is about: The deep, crushing feeling of loss is why the feeling of winning is so exhilarating. The highs are so high <i>because </i>of the depths of the lows.</p>

 <p>This is what I love about the PvPvE extraction genre: Everything matters and punishment is swift. The distant clap of gunfire isn’t set design, it’s an actual firefight that could quickly become your problem if you’re too close. You can hear nearby enemy players break into various loot caches, digging around for supplies, and that becomes a signal that you need to either GTFO or draw your weapon and be prepared. Enemy Arc drones and other machines are an essential part of this experience: They’re an opportunity for good loot, an engaging gun battle, or the best distraction in the world from enemy players who have you outgunned. The PvPvE is a triangle you rotate around.</p>

    <p>Fleeing battles during the Server Slam was sometimes as exhilarating as participating in them. The experience of trading shots with enemy players down long corridors of an abandoned water treatment facility, only to need to race down the labyrinthine maze of hallways, tossing smoke grenades behind me and barely making it to a door I can shut, giving me a precious few seconds to heal up and continue my escape or make a stand taps into something so exhilaratingly primal in my brain that even thinking about it makes my skin tingle a bit.</p>

    <p>Perhaps because it’s October and I’ve been on a huge survival horror kick in general, it dawned on me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/">extraction shooters and horror games</a> seem to poke at the same network of neurons in the human brain. Seeing another player can be a jumpscare; hell, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/">the game’s tumbleweeds</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa9ruw/every_signle_damn_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">random bits of garbage</a> that float around as set design often trigger a kind of PTSD response as, in order to survive, you do have to sort of assume anything that moves is a potential threat. I’ve shot a few tumbleweeds impulsively because surviving in this game means you have to close that distance between seeing a moving thing and shooting it.</p>    <p>And when things break out into full-on firefights with either human players or the game’s machines, it’s a spontaneous game of survival unlike anything else, given the real risk of dying and <i>not</i> respawning, losing your weapons and essential crafting loot. It’s a challenge to not let the lethality of the game consume you and turn your next run into a rage-filled revenge quest. The game is aware of this, as one of the post-death loading screens literally says “This could be an excellent start to your villain arc.”</p> <p>As one Redditor commented after suffering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9zr2w/i_tried_i_really_tried/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a humiliating betrayal by another player</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>I will never trust a raider again. It’s dog eat dog out there, and now this dog is hungry.</p></blockquote> <p>“Sure,” one Redditor replied, “it wasn’t a happy ending, but it’s a far more unique experience.” The risk of betrayal, the tender nature of any temporary alliance, the risk and reward, it’s what makes this whole thing so damn entertaining. Success is in rare supply, so you are regularly chasing it.</p>   <p>Fighting other humans is a ton of brutal, mean fun. But I was very surprised to find the game’s computer-controlled enemies, the E of the PvPvE triangle, were also great sparring partners and, interestingly, helpful informants.</p>

Other human players were added after developer Embark realized that simply fighting the game’s robots, collectively referred to as “Arc,” over and over again <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540">got old too fast</a>. And while I probably wouldn’t want to just play a game that pits me against these machines without human antagonistic forces, damn are they enjoyable pests to have roaming the skies.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ 2-Year Delay Explained: Game Was Boring</a></p> <p>Upon stepping out into the game’s post-apocalyptic maps, you’ll regularly see drones flying out in the distance, always keeping an eye on what’s going on underneath them. They come in a few varieties: drones with guns, drones that can summon other drones with guns, and of course the big ones that shoot rockets at you and are a literal terror. They’re deadly, sure, but their presence can also indicate where other players are, which is essential knowledge for survival. Arc drone behavior, whether they’re actively engaged in a firefight with other players or are searching for players they’ve caught sight of, sends a clear message: Either there’s a situation up ahead that you want to <i>avoid </i>or there’s a possible opportunity that you want to <i>exploit</i>. After all, looting a downed player is likely to net you a healthy injection of supplies and a decent chance to find a good weapon.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637363">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Drones let you know what you’re potentially getting yourself into while you’re traversing the map. They also make for unlikely temporary allies. On more than one occasion, I fired off shots at drones to lure them to my position to try and shake off some enemy players who were on my tail. Arc can rapidly change the dynamics of a firefight between players as they swiftly dart through the air and ignore the ground-level cover that players are hiding behind.</p>

 <p>And it seems much of the community shares my fondness for these airborne pests. <i>Thank the goddess</i>.</p> <p>One of the most up-voted threads, sitting just shy of 5k up arrows, on r/ArcRaiders is a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/"> plea to <i>not</i> nerf Arc</a> following the Server Slam. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oawvny/arc_are_not_overpowered_its_a_massive_skill_issue/">Arc’s lethality is the point</a>, others have argued, and they’re right.</p>   <p>Drones also offer a surprisingly fun test of marksmanship. They’re not just flying things for you to mindlessly pump bullets into for the sake of loot and experience points. You really have to place your shots well to come out alive. Shooting out the propellers on these machines can ground them faster than aiming at the core fuselage, but it also makes their flying behavior wildly erratic when a propeller or two is destroyed. Landing shots on them is as satisfying as nailing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">clay pigeon</a> in real life–something I haven’t done since I was a kid, yet <i>Arc Raiders</i> tapped right into that old muscle memory. To top it off, drones carry pretty decent crafting supplies, so there’s good reason to fuck with them if you’re confident you can earn their loot unscathed.</p>  <p>Thanks to all the ways they make the action more dynamic, these airborne pests never frustrated me the way flying enemies in games usually do. They’re useful for dealing with other players and somehow exist in this Goldilocks zone of being a lethal challenge that’s surprisingly fun to take down.</p>

 <h2>Will <i>Arc Raiders</i> shatter the extraction shooter’s glass ceiling?</h2> <p>Extraction shooters have struggled to hit critical mass in the way that, say, battle royales have. At their most intense–when they incorporate rigid survival mechanics like hunger and thirst, deadly fall damage, and the need to keep track of specific calibers of ammo like you do in, say, <i>Escape From Tarkov</i>–they’re just too grueling to ever appeal to a mass audience.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> streamlines many of the genre’s survival trappings: There’s no hunger or thirst. You can move pretty fast for a “realistic” game and can survive some pretty steep falls if you jump off a ledge. And ammo is abstracted down to light, medium, heavy, and shotgun (at least as far as what was on offer in the Server Slam). It’s an easier game than many of its more hardcore peers, but it’s still punishing.</p>

 <p>The Server Slam also capped out at a certain level. The game has skill trees that you invest points into to up your survival skills, improving everything from how long you can sprint, to how quickly you can vault over objects, to how much noise you make while rummaging through the detritus of a fallen civilization.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637362">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Given the level cap of 15 in the Server Slam, this weekend saw the intensity only ratchet up to a certain point. Once players have the full game, I wonder how chaotic, or potentially unfair, some builds will be, and at what point <i>Arc Raiders</i> may struggle to sustain that Goldilocks zone of tension. The game could also use some more QOL features such as double or triple key bindings and maybe some better inventory management tools.</p>

 <p>Still, I haven’t been this optimistic about a multiplayer game all year and I’m hungering for this game to return in a way that worries me. When the servers went dark last night, I was quite sad.</p> <p>So if you don’t see me in real space after October 30 when this game launches, don’t be surprised. This game is going to be a problem for me, and I’m so here for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Minnesota Rokkr in the Call of Duty League has rebranded as G2 Berlin, unveiling the brand in a short trailer posted on social media earlier today. This is the latest in a long line of rebrands that have shaken up the face of the CDL in recent months.</p>



<p>The pretty bizarre trailer revealed the G2 Berlin name but confirmed that the team will remain tied to Wisconsin. Per the team’s social bio, G2 Berlin is the home of G2 Esports in the Call of Duty space.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-g2-berlin">Enter G2 Berlin</h2>



<p>Minnesota Rokkr’s rebrand is the latest to hit the CDL space in the last few months. We recently saw the Vegas Falcons rebrand to the Riyadh Falcons in recognition of the team’s ownership, and then Atlanta FaZe became <strong>FaZe Vegas</strong>, filling the slot.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Some teams have yet to reveal their rebrand, such as the LA Guerrillas M8, which is <strong>believed </strong>to be relocating to Paris for the 2026 CDL season. It has been rumored that a Paris Major will surface late into the new season, taking place just before the Call of Duty League Championship, set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2026-hosted-faze-las-vegas/">hosted in Las Vegas by FaZe</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a wild off-season when it comes to ‘rostermania’. We saw aBeZy and Simp split for the first time in <strong>years</strong>, with the former sticking with FaZe while the latter took off to join a super team in LA Thieves. The LA Thieves now goes into the 2026 season with HyDra, Kenny, Scrap, and aBeZy on the roster.</p>



<p>FaZe, on the other hand, boasts Drazah, Simp, 04, and Abuzah, the latter two being young and hungry superstar competitors from Vancouver Surge who had a white-hot run through the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Cellium <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cellium-parts-ways-faze-seven-years-org/">also split from FaZe</a>, finding a home in the Riyadh Falcons.</p>



<p>What team do you think will rebrand next? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Could Launch a Week Early, It’s Suggested]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-could-launch-a-week-early-it%E2%80%99s-suggested.1329820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In social circles, rumors are being passed around that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <strong>could be released a week early</strong>. It’s set to drop on November 14, but if the suggestions are true, it could launch around November 7. Before getting into this one, it must be stressed that Activision has said <strong>nothing </strong>about this and it’s based on some loose claims at present.</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean a whole lot if Black Ops 7 is released early. It wouldn’t be the first game to do it and it certainly won’t be the last, but it does mean that fans don’t have to wait <strong>as long </strong>to sink their teeth into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-coming-out-early">Is Black Ops 7 Coming Out Early?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 could be coming out early, if online claims are to be believed.</p>



<p>On social media, some prominent profiles have propagated the rumors, with some suggesting that evidence is leaning towards the earlier launch window for Black Ops 7, set to be released otherwise on November 14.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems like there’s some evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7 where it could move up a week. Not sure I buy it yet but would be a pleasant surprise if it happens.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1980279695112319158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s looser than loose right now and nothing is concrete until Activision confirms it. We’re not able to corroborate the rumors, either.</p>



<p>Some have suggested on social media that the game’s campaign should drop a week early, which it has done in the past, to allow users to get the single-player portion of the game finished before tackling multiplayer a week later.</p>



<p>Recently, the Black Ops 7 beta kicked off and had some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-disrupted/">issues with cheaters</a>, which were reportedly ironed out quickly enough by Activision, with Team RICOCHET stressing how successful the game’s anti-cheat measures were during the beta periods.</p>



<p>In other news, Glen Schofield, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games, suggested that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-call-of-duty-director-says-none-of-the-games-have-been-very-good-since-he-left/">quality of Call of Duty games</a> has dropped since he stopped making them years ago.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d benefit from Black Ops 7 launching early? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu has shared his thoughts on the rise of artificial intelligence in gaming, saying in an interview that AI has some potential for music in games, but he doesn't plan to use the technology personally.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ">JASRAC Magazine</a>, Uematsu said it's possible AI could help with transitions in game music between sounds, but using generative AI to make new music for games is not something he is interested in pursuing.</p><p>"I've never used AI and probably never will.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That same "Chamber" codename appears on the resume of actor Jon McLaren, known for playing Star Lord in Square Enix's 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game. His resume lists "Project Chamber" as his most recent video game project, labeling it as an upcoming AAA game in which he plays a lead character. He also lists the project as coming from the motion-capture company Beyond Capture Studios. It's that same motion capture studio that has worked with Capcom on games like Street Fighter 6 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's not confirmed who McLaren is playing in the remake, it's likely Billy Coen, the male lead in Resident Evil 0 who aids Chambers in her mission to uncover more about a zombie outbreak on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p><p dir="ltr">Resident Evil 0's opening hours take place on a zombie-infested train, and according to MP1st, the remake will more fully flesh out various plot details and characters only alluded to in the original. That includes making the train's conductor a full-fledged character that interacts with Chambers and Coen rather than only being referenced like in the original.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when the Resident Evil 0 remake will arrive, it's likely still a few years away. A recent statement from frequent Capcom leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DuskGolem</a> points towards the Resident Evil 0 remake not releasing until 2028, with another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">rumored remake, Code Veronica,</a> set for 2027. Neither remake has been officially announced by Capcom.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, is coming February 27, 2026. It stars the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft, and will finally return the franchise to Raccoon City.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has some of the best character customization in Game Freak’s monster-taming series. Lumiose City’s wide array of fashion choices are a welcome change after </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>locked everyone into school uniforms, but the best addition is that none of these clothing items are gender-locked. So whether it’s skirts or long hair, whatever you see on the rack is yours to buy and wear as you please. The game is pretty fluid in how it lets players present themselves in the world, but even so, it’s got some gendered stuff in its story that some players aren’t thrilled about. However, the fashion freedom is helping people get around some of those limitations.</span></p> <p><span>When you pick your character’s initial appearance, you’re also picking whether the game will recognize them as male or female, regardless of what you’re wearing. However, you’re also picking who your rival is going to be. If you play as a male character, you’ll be greeted by a young girl named Taunie when you arrive in Lumiose City. Conversely, a female trainer will meet Urbain, a boy who has a similar role and aesthetic, but is otherwise a different person. At first, I kinda figured this split would be in service of some shoehorned, heterosexual romantic subplot, but thankfully it never came to that. I rolled credits last night and I’m still not a hundred percent sure what the point of having these two characters is, beyond giving the main cast an even gender divide. Maybe I’ll find out more as I make my way through the post-game. That said, some fans want to play as a girl and have Taunie on their team, or want to be a boy and hang out with Urbain. So while it’s not a perfect solution, some players are taking up crossdressing to present as one gender and still get their preferred rival.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Made The Xbox Ally X $1000, Not Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-made-xbox-ally-price-not-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-made-the-xbox-ally-x-1000-not-microsoft.1329781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (and Ally) have just been released, and they’re turning heads on account of a) their processing power and capabilities, and b) their eye-watering price tags. The Xbox Ally X will break the bank at $1,000, which is a huge hurdle for adoption. In a recent interview, Xbox’s president revealed that Microsoft didn’t have any guidance when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>It was stated that the Xbox Ally X at $1,000 and the Xbox Ally at $599 came straight from the head honchos and market analysts at ASUS, and neither Xbox nor Microsoft had a say in the price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-why-the-xbox-ally-x-is-so-expensive">This is Why The Xbox Ally X is So Expensive</h2>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment, offering cutting-edge handheld capabilities on a device that’s comfort redefined. It has a great battery life, neat cooling solutions, room for expansion, and a splash of RGB, all packaged alongside tactile buttons, a high-quality and durable screen, and punchy speakers.</p>



<p>That was all summed up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, anyway.</p>



<p>What the Xbox Ally X also has is a $1,000 price tag, which is enough to put off first-time buyers. In a recent interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox, confirmed that Microsoft had no input whne it came to pricing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware. That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the staggering price point, Bond revealed that the Xbox Store sold out ‘really quickly’ and suggested that the value that’s being given to gamers for the price is more than worthwhile.</p>



<p>But she has to say that, right?</p>



<p>Bond used the current line of Xbox marketing spiel to further promote the Xbox Ally X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that people have a choice.</p>



<p>We want to make sure there’s an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what’s possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they’re a casual gamer, they’re a gaming enthusiast, then there’s Xbox Allys for them.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My relationship with <em>Hades 2</em> is very much a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJb4tWfpcOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck you and I’ll see you tomorrow</a>” situation. Do I endlessly complain about minor things that I don’t like about it, in its mechanics and its <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a>? Yes. Am I going to play another half dozen hours of it tonight? Also yes. As I continue to go deeper and deeper, as compelled as I am by essentially just getting more of <em>Hades</em>, it strikes me that so many of the returning features are basically the same, but just a little worse. Case in point: the romances.</p><p>I am a known dating game lover, and I found the romance options in the first <em>Hades</em> to be delightful, especially because of how unexpected they were. It’s already a narrative-heavy roguelike, stuffed to the brim with characters—being able to have a deeper connection to two of my favorites, Thanatos and Megaera, was a delight. <em>And</em> you could complete both of these romance arcs at the same time, and neither character would get mad at Zagreus!</p><p>In <em>Hades 2</em> you get double the romances, which I should love. The issue is that all these characters feel extremely similar to each other.</p><p>If you’re romancing women, you have the options of Nemesis and Eris. While they’re quite different from each other in terms of the way they talk and interact with the world, when it comes to player character Melinoe, the relationship is defined by high-key just hating her. Nemesis thinks that <em>she</em> should be the one to take down Chronos, who has taken over the underworld, and Eris is literally the goddess of strife and discord. So that’s my options for gay romance: two women who hate me.</p><p>The men aren’t much better. While I like both Moros and Icarus, they suffer from their personalities being too similar. Yes, they have different backstories and their stories with Melinoe play out differently, but they’re also both these sensitive, wilting men who leave me longing for a contrasting character. Like the women romances, their relationships with Melinoe are just too similar for me to have much of a motivation to seek them out. Like much of <em>Hades 2</em>, there’s more options, but it’s difference without distinction.</p><p>What’s so annoying is that there are other new characters who I would love to romance but pointedly cannot. Heracles and Odysseus are both probably too old for Melinoe, but they’re very different from each other, and from the existing romance options. Heracles, as you might imagine, is muscled and gruff, and while he also doesn’t like Melinoe on first blush, he respects her once he sees her in action. Odysseus is positioned as an older brother or uncle type, but he also spends the entire game calling Melinoe “goddess” in a way that makes me, the player, quite flustered—both in myth and in this game, Odysseus has rizz. Most importantly, they are just different types of guys. They are different from each other, and from the existing romances.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve also wanted to romance Artemis since the first <em>Hades</em>, where her Olympian siblings teased her for having a crush on Zagreus. In <em>Hades 2</em> Artemis is once again a close friend who aids you in your struggle, and she’s also still gentle and sweet. I would love to have a chance to romance a female character who actually likes talking to me and being around me.</p><p>Mostly I feel like I’ve lost out on characterization for Melinoe because all these romances are so similar. With both Nemesis and Eris, the main conflict in the romantic subplot is that they don’t like Melinoe, and they have to learn to get along. With Moros and Icarus, both these characters kind of already have a crush on Melinoe and have to learn to get over their shyness. With Zagreus, the romances expanded his character and allowed you to see him from different sides. With Melinoe, I feel like I’m just seeing the same aspects of her character explored over and over—the way she clashes with women, and the way that she doesn’t see how reverent men are of her power.</p><p>Oh well. I guess I just have to play this game for another hundred hours.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-nemesis-eris-icarus-moros-romance]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year has been an incredible year for gaming. From highly anticipated sequels like Hades 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong to surprising hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, 2025 proved to be one of the better years for games at every level in recent memory. But if 2025 was great, a quick look at upcoming games suggests that next year might be even better. These are the most anticipated games for 2026.</p>



<p>With this list, only games that are first release and available on multiple platforms are eligible. That means games currently in early access, but planned to launch in 2026, don’t count. Also, if you’re looking for the most anticipated exclusives for consoles like the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Nintendo Switch 2, those will be posted separately. </p>



<p>As of now, all of these games below are currently scheduled for a release next year. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026">What Are The Most Anticipated Games Of 2026?</h2>

<p>First announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero is one of the most anticipated action RPG titles in some time.

<p>Characters appearing in the game include a mix of old and new, such as M, Miss Moneypenny, Q, Dr. Selina Tan, and DGSE agent Miss Roth. The game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch 2 on March 27, 2026.</p>
