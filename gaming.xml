<p>Tanks for the memories</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series is back with another cabinet classic on Switch 2. I got to check out Jet Ski racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> back in August, which was a lovingly crafted port. This time I'm revisiting the destructive tank combat of Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Tokyo Wars</a>, which served as inspiration for The 3DO Company's N64 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/battletanx_global_assault">Battle Tanx: Global Assault</a>.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet was notable for having a cabinet containing a replica Jet Ski, something which can’t really be recreated on Switch (without some serious hardware modding). Tokyo Wars had a similar hardware quirk that provided a satisfying kickback to simulate your tank firing its payload. A feature that is, bafflingly, not emulated with the Switch 2 controllers' haptics.</p>
<p>Aside from the complete lack of feedback when unleashing shells on enemy tanks, this port is as clean and generously featured as I've come to expect from Hamster Corp.</p>
<p>The premise couldn't be simpler: Rival factions battle it out in the streets of Tokyo. You choose from White Force or Green Force and roll around the map, shelling any opposing tank you find, while avoiding your team’s armour. This was a great game back in the day and it's worth experiencing now, even if there isn't much to do in its two arenas.</p>
<p>This 1996 title looks as polished as it possibly could be, outside of being remastered. Visuals and audio are crisp and suit docked and undocked modes equally, with many format options to tweak the experience to your liking. Special mention goes to crisp presentation of Akihiko Ishikawa's insane music, which makes you feel like you're at a sweaty Japanese rave instead of a warzone.</p>
<p>Both English and Japanese versions of the game are playable in all available modes. Caravan time attack makes a return and can be played in split screen. Other modes can also be played in up to four-player local split screen.</p>
<p>Much like other games in the Arcade Archives, all the content in Tokyo Wars has to offer can be experienced in minutes. An additional Multiplayer mode is the only thing that would extend the lifespan of this slight experience.</p>
<p>Enjoyment comes from improving on your own performance and competing with others, as is usual with an arcade title. That said, the more of these Arcade Archives titles that Hamster Corp puts out, the more it becomes evident that an 'Arcade Archives 2 Collection' would be much more value for money than individual releases.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new line of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> has had both highs and lows. The Switch RPG’s wave of superpowered transformations has its fair share of undisputed bangers like Mega Drampa, who turns from its wise old dragon form into a younger, battle-ready one, and Delphox, who defies gravity while flying on a witch’s broom. Still, there are a handful, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>long-legged Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, that have split the community. Another of those less widely beloved Megas is Feraligatr, one of the game’s starter Pokémon, though some fan artists have been creating their own interpretations that show the design isn’t beyond salvage; it just looks kind of dumb as it’s presented in-game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642463"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642463">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When Feraligatr mega evolves, it gains a large red dorsal fin on its back that, when combined with the new spikes on its arms, creates what resembles a giant Totodile mascot head. A lot of Mega Evolutions have elements of a Pokémon’s previous evolutions, like Mega Raichu’s fur reverting to Pikachu’s signature yellow or Mega Chimecho growing a massive Chingling-shaped ornament. Mega Feraligatr’s big Totodile head is one of the most extreme examples of a Mega Evolution following this design philosophy. However, it ends up looking absurd because the giant fin on Feraligatr’s back stays flipped open like a toilet lid.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, this giant Totodile mask can bite down 10 times harder than Feraligatr’s actual jaw, so it makes sense that the water dragon would keep its fake jaw as extended as possible until it attacks. Poor guy runs around with this flapping fake jaw behind it, but as fan artists and animators have discovered, one small tweak actually improves the design significantly: just put the hood down.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">mega Feraligatr but the Totodile head doesn't flip back <a href="https://t.co/wLeCXyMCzh">pic.twitter.com/wLeCXyMCzh</a></p> <p>— doodlelotl (@Doodlelot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Doodlelot/status/1980380003952169372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">making renders of Mega Feraligatr and it would be my favorite new design if it permanently leaned into the camouflage look like this instead of the toilet seat lid <a href="https://t.co/cotsIVL85C">pic.twitter.com/cotsIVL85C</a></p> <p>— Lewtwo (@Lewchube) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1983534993638089104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Feraligatr but it actually commits to the Totodile disguise <a href="https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y">https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y</a> <a href="https://t.co/TXlOHfRaLw">pic.twitter.com/TXlOHfRaLw</a></p> <p>— Yisuno ⚝ | MEGA ENJOYER (@TheYisusOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheYisusOne/status/1990072615533228531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>No matter how you slice it, Mega Feraligatr’s design looks pretty silly, but it’s much easier to buy when it looks like the alligator is using the fake head as a type of camouflage rather than as if it’s&nbsp; sporting an unclosed toilet. Maybe when Mega Feraligatr appears in games and media outside of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, The Pokémon Company will give it different idle animations that could help communicate the idea better than what we’ve got. For now, we’ve got fan artists who are singlehandedly turning folks around on the design.</span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Twitch, on Wednesday, announced changes to how the company will tracking views for clips in order to “better reflect genuine viewer engagement”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1991208256614854719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company is making five specific changes that will track more views more accurately. It also continues the company’s recent efforts to combat view botting that has plagued the site for a while. </p>







<p><strong>“While clip views may initially appear lower, you’ll now have cleaner and more consistent cross-platform clips data that will ultimately help provide you with better insights into clip performance,” </strong>Twitch said. </p>



<p>As far as the specific changes go, those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing a technical issue that was inadvertently inflating clip view counts</li>



<li>Including clip views from Stories in clip view totals</li>



<li>Making view counting more consistent across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)</li>



<li>Better filtering out of bot traffic</li>



<li>Enabling improved clip analytics and laying the groundwork for us to explore new analytics features</li>
</ul>



<p><strong> “Going forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune our clip view counting system on an ongoing basis,”</strong> they added. </p>

This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you.

Details about the hot fix, which were published in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, highlight a fix for those pesky defibrillators, as well as tweaks to the new limited-time Sabotage game mode and additional challenges changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players took to social media to complain of inconsistent defibrillators following the launch of the Battlefield 6 California Resistance update yesterday. Where previous versions of the game had players using the Support gadget to slide and dive in for last-second saves, changes brought about by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>update 1.1.2.0</u></a> instead asked players to slowly and precisely use the tool if they wanted to revive their friends. It’s resulted only in confusion, as the demanding requirements left teammates with what has been perceived as either a new bug or a bizarre nerf without any explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At first I thought it was just a pointless range nerf,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0yjlv/comment/npn1bdq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> says, “but it's also <em>much</em> more inconsistent and easy to get bodies bugged into a state where the defib doesn't work at all, and you have to grab / drag them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall, I hate it, but that second part of it makes me think it wasn't really intentional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team didn’t clarify what caused faulty defibrillators to pollute matches, but it sounds like they didn’t like the change either. Today’s hotfix reverts the gadget back to how it was before yesterday’s update by increasing hit-boxes and range.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sabotage game mode has had its AFK kick timer increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds.

                <p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an additional version of Homer Simpson</a>, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities.</p><p>The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/terrycarter/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-nipples" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott</a> performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240"></a><figcaption>This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.</p><p>But the leaker who broke this one, Dr Cacahuette, <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991079736726970702" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims</a> it has associated accessories, a Lego style, and support for kicks, all of which point to it being a player skin. It's possible it will be free, like the cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin was before the end of Remix season a year ago, but since Epic is already giving away the Cuddle Team Rider skin in a separate event, Underwear Homer is likely to be in the item shop.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/24/tales-of-berseria-review/">Tales of Berseria Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tales of Berseria review, Miguel said, <em>“Tales of Berseria feels like a Tales game made just for me. There’s so many games in the series now, and I’ll never play them all, but the characters and the narrative and the combat mechanics of Berseria just click with all of my tastes so well. For some, the lack of gameplay innovation might be a turn off, but for me, a classic Tales gameplay system combined with a unique narrative led to a fantastic experience. Fans both new and old would be doing a disservice to themselves if they didn’t check this game out.”</em></p>

		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that a free update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will release next week, adding a New Game Plus mode, new trophies, new cosmetics and more. The patch will launch on 24th November</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - New Game+ | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Game Plus will be playable once you’ve beaten the main game, and it does exactly what you’d expect. You get to start the game over and start off with all the skills and weapons from your first playthrough. So you’ll have a gun right from the start.</p>
<p>Of course, the point is that you’re then playing the game on a higher difficulty, and this adds two new Trophies</p>
<p>A new currency is also being added –&nbsp;Ghost Flowers –&nbsp;which can be exchanged for 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. There is also an additional tier of upgrades for existing armour sets and weapons.</p>

<p>For the game generally, the patch will let you replay content in the post-game after finishing the main story, and there’s a new stats display for this. New button mapping is available in accessibility settings, and new Photo Mode features like shutter speed and a composition grid.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly typical post-launch update that we often see for big budget games, but there’s more exciting stuff coming in 2026, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-is-coming-in-2026-as-a-free-update/">the multiplayer Legends mode has been promised</a> for then –&nbsp;again as a free update.</p>
<p>Aran was full of praise for&nbsp;Ghost of Yōtei in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">our review,</a> saying it “is an excellent game with an engrossing story, a great lead, deep combat and a land that has so much to discover with a lot of details. This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.”</p>

            <p>
Ark is one of those strange series to me that seems to have a ridiculous amount of cash to dispense, what with its star-studded cast in the animated adaptation. Gerard Butler and bloody Michelle Yeoh are in it! Not to mention David Tenant, Elliot Page, Russel Crowe and Vin Diesel, the final of whom is meant to be in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">borderline MIA</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>. But some of those voices will be appearing in-game through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended's</a> next expansion, Lost Colony, which now has a release date!
</p>
<p>
Said release date is a little over a month away on December 16th, and according to a press release makes direct connections between Ark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a> and Genesis expansions, and Ark 2. It's a little bit of prep work, essentially.

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtcKl-NNnLM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Yeoh is back in her role from the animated series, alongside Tennant as his, as well as cast members like Madeleine Madden (Wheel of Time), Auli'i Cravalho (Moana), Katie Sackhoff (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a>) and Keith David (Coraline).
</p>
<p>
While this feels like an odd way to put it, Lost Colony adds in the first "canonical" expansion map into Ark: Survival Ascended, though I'm sure the presumably many Ark loreheads can speak to that better than I can. Once you start up the expansion, you'll find yourself in a big ole city where something's hunting you down. 
</p><p>
There'll be new abilities, gears, building systems, the usual expansion affair. And from today until the expansion launches, a new dino, the Ossidon, will be wandering around cold-biomes in Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center. The trailer above puts a spotlight on this admittedly nasty looking beastie. Happy Arking, Arkers! Or Survival Ascending? You get what I mean.

                <p>David Anthony Burke, who began his music career as D4vd after uploading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> montages to YouTube with his own original songs in 2021, has reportedly been identified as a suspect in the murder of Celeste Rivas.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/11/18/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas-death/#continued" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, law enforcement said that despite there being no official paperwork classifying Burke as a suspect yet, "investigators are looking at [him] as a suspect." Those same investigators reportedly claimed they're viewing Rivas' death as a homicide while waiting on toxicology results from the medical examiner's office.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas/3806178/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Los Angeles report</a> corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring. According to law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decomposed-body-found-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-los-angeles-rcna230159" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who spoke to NBC News</a>, Rivas' remains were not intact when discovered.</p><p>Sources told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/singer-d4vd-considered-suspect-investigation-teen-found-dead/story?id=126591951" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that, although the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, investigators have contacted multiple people they believe were involved with the case in some way. This includes Burke.</p><p>Celeste Rivas disappeared in the Lake Elsinore area last year. She was reportedly last seen on April 5, 2024, in the western Riverside County community in Southern California. Family members said she knew Burke, and her brother, Matthew, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/body-of-teen-girl-found-in-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-what-we-know/3826873/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told NBCLA</a> that she was on her way to see a movie with him the day she disappeared.</p><p>Rivas' body was found in the front trunk of a Tesla parked in an LA tow yard on September 8. Workers noticed a foul odor coming from the vehicle, which was registered to Burke, and notified nearby authorities. Officers came through and discovered the remains in a bag, later to be identified via forensics as the missing teenager.</p><p>Burke was a rising star in the alternative R&amp;B scene, but he started as a gamer. He uploaded various Fortnite montages and anime compilations to YouTube under a channel called "ant" in 2021, but his videos kept getting copyright strikes because of his music choices. To combat this, he started creating his own songs to pair with his videos, which eventually led to his D4vd persona, which he claimed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbF7opVBnHQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Zach Sang Show interview</a> was both for SEO and the four cinematic universes (and the characters) he was building.</p><p>He quickly found popularity on TikTok and eventually signed a record deal with Interscope Records' Darkroom label. He'd then produce a single for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-calls-out-netflix-for-disrespectful-ai-made-arcane-season-2-poster/1100-6527972/" data-ref-id="1100-6527972">Arcane Season 2</a>, record the official Fortnite anthem "Locked &amp; Loaded," perform at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards in December 2024</a>, and go on a world tour in August 2025. The remaining tour dates have been canceled following Rivas' death.</p><p>According to ABC News, investigators believe that the medical examiner's office will determine the official cause of death soon. Sources said this will be a vital step in making an arrest and finalizing the charges.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragons-dogma-2-sales-top-4m-capcom-reveals.1358365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, so if you're hoping for more titles in the series, this should hopefully serve as a strong motivator for the publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1990948257384526335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media earlier today, Capcom announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit four million. That, naturally, includes all of the platforms on which the game is available, as well as both physical and digital shipments.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new milestone, Capcom also released a new piece of artwork thanking players who've already picked the game up. It's pretty heartwarming, so feel free to give yourself a pat on the back if you're one of the "Arisen" the artwork is thanking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=9iNNBoim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=fq_TzvMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has reached four million sales around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass another 1.5 million sales for itself since last count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>, so it's selling pretty steadily, if perhaps not quite as meteorically as some of Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">other titles</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>, it's the sequel to the 2012 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>, with that game's director Hideaki Itsuno returning to direct (although he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">since departed Capcom</a> to join Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios).</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is a sequel (the clue's in that number after the name), it's perhaps better thought of as a reboot or a followup; it takes place in a parallel world and doesn't require any knowledge of the first game to enjoy.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of the Arisen, who must command Pawns in order to slay a dragon, all while exploring a vast open world littered with sidequests and locations to discover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch have announced that open-world action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a New Game Plus mode next week, so you'll soon be able to start a fresh run tooled up to the nines.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony reveals that New Game Plus is coming to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>on November 24th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing). As you'd expect, it'll allow you to start a new run with all of your armor, abilities, and weapons from your previous playthrough.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s main story before you can enjoy New Game Plus, but once you've unlocked the mode, you can also look forward to two extra difficulty levels to challenge you even further, plus two new Trophies to earn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=XXSCSW_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=81XRKgb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to jump into New Game Plus mode in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>New Game Plus will also bring a new Ghost Flower currency that can be exchanged for new cosmetic armor sets and weapon dyes, as well as ten new charms and an extra tier of armor and weapon upgrades.</p>

<p>This update isn't just bringing New Game Plus goodies, however. It's also introducing replayable content once you've finished the main game, and a new stats screen will tell you just how well you did when you replay said content.</p>

<p>New accessibility options, including directional button remapping, are also on the way, along with enhanced Photo Mode features like a new composition grid and adjustable shutter speed to help you snap that perfect shot.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, it's the second game in what is now Sony and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>franchise. It serves as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">indirect followup</a> to 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, pitting new protagonist Atsu against the Yotei Six, who slaughtered her family years before the game's narrative takes place.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-new-ghost-in-familiar-tale" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Embark says that PS4 support for the game will be coming to an end on March 18th, which is also when the shooter's tenth season is set to start.</p>

<p>Embark says it's retiring the game on PS4 in order to "focus [its] support on current generation hardware", and it's far from alone in making that decision; it joins illustrious company like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s HoYoverse</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG</em>'s Krafton</a>.</p>

<p>This news also doesn't affect players on current-gen platforms or PC, nor does it affect Xbox One owners, because, well,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>never got itself an Xbox One release. In fact, judging from <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/1990914208905515479" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/0xmikubeam/status/1991020255057961288" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">replies</a> to Embark's social media message, many people were unaware&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em> was available on PS4.</p>

<p>News of <i>The Finals</i>' sunsetting on PS4 comes as Embark Studios celebrates another major success, namely extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, which launched last month to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">very strong sales indeed</a>.</p>

<p>That game looks set to become part of Embark's regular stable alongside <em>The Finals</em>; it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow">received a major update</a> lowering some of its cosmetic prices and rebalancing duo queueing, and more updates and patches are planned for the future as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The lore-YouTuber-to-book-publisher pipeline is alive and well. <em>Borderlands 4</em> has another busted exploit, and fired Rockstar devs aren’t going quietly. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. According to a handful of Polymarket weirdos, <em>Half-Life 3</em> has a 56 percent chance of being announced before 2027 but only a 7 percent chance of arriving before the end of 2025. Fans are <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">getting ready either way</a>.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s unofficial YouTube lore master is putting out a 400-page book</h2>  <p>Michael “VaatiVidya” Samuels’ YouTube channel is where everyone who loves FromSoftware games but can’t make heads or tails of their stories while playing goes to figure out what the hell is actually going on. He’ll now be boiling down dozens of hours of video into a more digestible form, assuming you belong to an age cohort that’s still literate. <em>Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained</em> starts at just $42 for the softback version and comes with a magnificent cover.</p>

 <p>“This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, and <em>Nightreign</em> into one single volume,” VaatiVidya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D">said on YouTube</a>. “My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.” It arrives just in time to explain the games before the upcoming Hollywood adaptation arrives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-movie-alex-garland-hidetaka-miyazaki-atari-2000620675">I’m sure Alex Garland will be buying a copy</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> glitch lets you speedrun the skill tree</h2> <p>Normally, you have to invest tons of points per Vault Hunter to unlock their strongest abilities at the bottom of their skill trees. There’s a shortcut, however. YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Joltzdude139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joltzdude139</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-glitch-unlock-late-game-skills-without-wasting-points/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>) explains how it works. The glitch revolves around repeatedly using the “dump all points option” and reversing it to trick the game into thinking you’ve spent more points than you have.</p>

 <p>Time consuming though it may be, it eventually unlocks the whole tree without using all your points to engineer more busted builds, at least until it <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1990927794000572519?s=20">gets patched out</a>. The full video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmTrfhPuhw">will take you through all the steps</a>.</p> <h2>Fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs are still protesting outside Rockstar</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fired GTA 6 devs held a protest outside the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament</p> <p>"GTA 6 will make billions… But I want people to think of the human cost" <a href="https://t.co/pssbIt30LK">pic.twitter.com/pssbIt30LK</a></p> <p>— Dexerto (@Dexerto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1990857470000967749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I was scared at first, I was apprehensive to join,” one of them said outside the studio’s Edinburgh office this week, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/fired-gta-6-devs-speak-out-about-working-conditions-at-rockstar-at-protests-outside-offices-3284831/"><em>Dexerto</em> reports</a>. “Like many of my colleagues in QA I always felt a bit more dispensable and a bit less skilled than workers in other departments,” he said. “I thought that by joining the union, I could be putting a target on my back. No one should ever feel this way when organizing in their workplace.”</p>

 <p>The studio has yet to elaborate on the firings beyond accusing the developers of leaking company secrets. The matter is currently awaiting review before the UK’s employment tribunal. <em>GTA 6</em> is currently set to release exactly one year from today.</p>

 <h2>Having trouble reviving friends in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? You’re not alone</h2> <p>The shooter’s latest major patch apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1990751823146389872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1990751823146389872%7Ctwgr%5Ef30118f2c4253b9223e8b70a1499cb41306c14da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbattlefield-6-defibs-broken-latest-update%2F">broke defibrillators</a>. Many players have reported “watching friendlies try and revive right now and so many of the hits are failing.” The game’s designers are already <a href="http://I've seen quite a few reports yeah, will investigate what's happening">investigating the issue</a>, so a fix might be on the way by this weekend. <strong>Update 11/19/2025 1:27 p.m. ET:</strong> that was quick! A <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20">new update</a> is already live.</p>

 <h2>Where is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>‘s big expansion?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOU'RE WELCOME NOW GIVE US DLC PLEASE <a href="https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e">https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e</a></p> <p>— FightinCowboy (@Fightincowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fightincowboy/status/1990950415048061015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans are still hoping for a <em>Dark Arisen</em>-style DLC now that the friction-filled action-RPG has sold 4 million copies. Hideaki Itsuno left to join Tencent’s LightSpeed Studios shortly after release, however, so who knows what Capcom is planning.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Quest 7</em> is being reimagined as a shorter game</h2> <p>Usually, remakes add more content. <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> will take some out. The PS1 version was already over 100 hours. The 3DS remaster was a bit shorter. Square Enix is cutting even more content to streamline the latest version. “Some of the [stories] have now been made optional, so you can play them in any order you want,” producer Takeshi Ichikawa <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/at-100-hours-dragon-quest-7-is-an-enormous-jrpg-so-in-the-reimagined-remake-a-few-of-the-stories-which-werent-100-percent-relevant-to-the-main-storyline-have-just-been-cut-entirely/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>.” He added, “a few of the stories which weren’t 100 percent relevant to the main storyline have just been cut entirely.” I hope the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> team isn’t listening.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> campaign is very weird and very bad</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/morsels-roguelike-binding-isaac-pokemon-2000645175">Morsels, on the other hand, is super surreal and incredibly cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103">Is the center of gaming really moving from console to PC?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Epic Games is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teaming up with Unity </a>to support the popular game engine within Fortnite. Eventually, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, this partnership will allow "all Unity games" to be published within Fortnite. That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite.</p><p>"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines," <a href="https://x.com/unrealengine/status/1991074004963057977" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sweeney said</a> Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference.</p><p>This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks</a>, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite.</p><p>It's been a common theory among Fortnite players that Epic will eventually incorporate as many of its other games into Fortnite as it can--and this Unity news will surely fuel rumors about Fall Guys becoming a proper Fortnite mode. While most Epic titles run on Unreal Engine, as you'd expect since that's Epic's own engine, Fall Guys is a rare exception that runs on Unity. Epic has allowed folks who use the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to make their own Fall Guys islands in Fortnite since August 2024, and so it wouldn't be all that surprising if Epic ended up adding the proper full Fall Guys game into Fortnite as part of this partnership with Unity.</p><p>This deal is still fresh, though, and it'll be a bit before we learn many specific details--Epic promises to deliver more info next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">announced it will soon require facial recognition-based age verification</a> from its players to unlock communication features. Beginning in the first week of December, starting with Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the rest of the world in 2026, this new security feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">is the latest effort from the company to make it a safer platform for children</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>All users can now voluntarily go through the Facial Age Estimation process to secure their access to communication features," </em>it wrote in a new blog post<em>. "During the first week of December, we’ll begin enforcing the age check requirement in select markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Those requirements will extend to the rest of the world wherever chat is available in early January.</em>"</p>



<p>With this decision, Roblox claims it is "<em>ushering in [a] new safety standard</em>," and says "<em>this innovation supports age-based chat and limits communication between minors and adults</em>."</p>



<p>Following the passing of new legislation in the UK, Discord implemented its own facial recognition age verification for its British users. Facial recognition that was immediately tricked <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">with nothing more than a copy of Death Stranding</a>.</p>

<iframe title="Introducing Age Checks to Unlock Chat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrt2Cs5LbbI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Roblox's verification could fare much better, but while this new measure could do what the company claims it can do, it's by no means a perfect solution. </p>



<p>"<em>As the internet has matured, technological advancements in safety and security have steadily shifted the industry's approach to age assurance. While initial efforts relied on simple self-declared age to manage access to features, the industry has since progressed to behavioral based methods</em>," the blog continues.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Roblox is going further. We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">Trusted Connections</a> with people they know.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>This initiative is designed to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for all users, which we believe will improve interactions for users of all ages on Roblox."</em></p>

            <p>
It's been seven years since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>, and in all that time, I've somehow never noticed that the title is a reference to sleepless penury. My mind jumped to the association of moonlight with magic and romance, skimming clean over the less enchanting sense of "moonlighting" as working a second job after dark. Luckily, this knowledge has dawned on me just in time to softly kneecap my enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, which launches into early access today, and appears quite a bit different from its predecessor.

What's the same? Well, it's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">a real-time action-RPG about having a second job as a village storekeeper</a>. By day, you stock shelves with potions, etcetera and work the till. By night, you head into the catacombs to replenish your wares. 
</p>
<p>
What's changed? Well, it's now a 3D game with an angled third-person camera, rather than a top-down pixelganza. They've also moved away from the original Zelda or Binding Of Isaac-style dungeon format. Instead of an expanse of rooms that seal you in till you've killed all their monsters, you'll be picking from branching paths as in a roguelike such as Hades.</p><p>The inventory management side has been re-puzzlified with (for example) new items that consume adjacent items, perhaps gaining in strength for every treasure they eat. The shop management stuff is more elaborate, with new modifiers to boost the value of otherwise homely goods.
</p>
<p>Developers Digital Sun and publishers 11-Bit aren't sure how long it'll be in early access. The current version includes three dungeon biomes with their own enemies, around 120 relics, four main weapons, and roughly 100 shop and dungeon perks. The final version will have more environments, bosses, loot, NPCs, quests and story stuff, plus expanded shop systems, events and customisation options. All this plus the customary bugfixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>
Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/">Steam</a>. I enjoyed the first Moonlighter, and I'm uncertain about the new dungeons and visual direction, but the inventory and shop enhancements sound worthwhile on paper. To circle back to my intro, I'm a bit concerned that I can be persuaded to overlook exploitative or precarious working conditions if they're presented to me in fluffy fantasy language. Please do not start referring to staff cuts as Ye Olde Layoffs, publishers.

            <p>
I won't comment on the quality of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, the game, because I've not had the chance to play it, though obviously it's not been received with all that much fanfare. You know what I did quite like? Marathon, the short film, the one that came with the game's reveal from Alberto Mielgo. It felt like a strong promise of a (more-or-less) fresh sci-fi world, the performances were subdued, it felt larger than life. Good stuff! Yet as many things currently are, it's been scrutinised over potential AI use, prompting Mielgo to put out a (understandably aggro) statement.
</p>
<p>
Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/">Instagram</a>, Mielgo said that he couldn't believe "we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO." He went on to note that everything in the film, including "paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders [were] done with [a] huge team - 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time."
</p>
<p>
On the topic of what Mielgo's personal opinion on AI was, he perhaps more sheepishly noted that he has "no idea." To his credit, he followed that up by saying that "AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced." He then sort of ruined that sentiment by finishing with the line, "this text was kindly edited with ChatGPT," a line written so dryly I honestly can't tell if it's a joke or not (I hope so).
</p>
<p>
In seemingly now-deleted comments on the same Instagram post (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">The Game Post</a>), Mielgo responded to someone asking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">Marathon's plagiarism issue</a>, obviously a hot button topic in the world of AI, and his thoughts on the fact that some of these plagiarised assets may have been handed off to the director to make his short film with. He explained, "you know what I hate the most? Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers. Go whistle around."
</p><p>
To be unfair to both Mielgo and Bungie, there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">has been</a> a <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">pattern</a> of <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">plagiarism issues</a> at the studio over the years. A one off is one thing, but this is notably questionable. Anyway, I do think people should stop trying to sniff out AI use because annoyingly the stuff is getting better at making "art", so let's put our focus into just completely snuffing it out, yeah?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hurry-to-nab-the-powera-wireless-controller-mario-joy-edition-for-just-27-today-2000645239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-powera-mario-controller-for-switch-is-now-the-cheapest-nintendo-licensed-steal-at-nearly-50-off.1358296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has started offering its early Black Friday deals, and if you’re a Nintendo Switch player, one of the best gaming accessories is currently going for nearly half off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The PowerA wireless controller (Mario Joy Edition) is down to just $27, thanks to a 46% discount that’s live on Amazon right now.</a></p>
<p>The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders. Even better, you don’t need to worry about entering any weird coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. The offer, however, is selling fast, which means it won’t be around for much longer. Grab it while it is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Use for Long Gaming Sessions</h2>
<p>This fun red controller has a lot of personality. There’s a Mario graphic on the side, plus colorful buttons that elevate the look while sticking to the overall theme. The ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold, so you can game for hours without ending up with sore palms. You’re getting a familiar button layout with precision analog sticks, a full-size D-pad, and all the essential ABXY and shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>The controller plays nicely with all current models, including the Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and even the latest Switch 2. It runs on AA batteries that offer up to 40 hours of gameplay. You can easily go a couple of weeks without worrying about swapping them out. And since it’s wireless, you can move around freely without a cable getting in the way. Sitting back, standing up, or just passing it around; gaming is going to be convenient.</p>



<p>Just note that it doesn’t support HD rumble, IR camera, or Amiibo NFC scanning, like most other options in this range. If that isn’t a dealbreaker for you, this PowerA wireless controller in Mario Joy is a great option to consider otherwise. It not only looks cool, but offers solid performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The compatibility is impressive as well, as so is the battery. This deal brings the price down to just $27 after a massive 46% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the retailer is likely going to push the price back up soon. Act fast before that happens!</p>
