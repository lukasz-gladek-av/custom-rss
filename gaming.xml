			<p>Koei Tecmo has officially announced the first story line details for their new <a href="https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-brings-back-1v1k-action-in-2025/">upcoming action game</a> Dynasty Warriors: Origins. This game is slated for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Koei Tecmo has promised that this game will be the most jam-packed and intense action game out of any of the Warriors games already available on the market. Players engage in a 1 vs 1,000 action set in 183 AD.</p>
<p>This game introduces you to a heroic warrior who has to fight off waves of enemies on the battlefields of the ancient Three Kingdoms. The story takes place one year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion, where players are introduced to the protagonist suffering from amnesia and heading to a village suffering from famine.</p>
<p>In the village, the protagonist meets a man called Zhang Jiao, who is offering a helping hand to the people, and Guan Yu, who is denouncing the government officials. As a trio, they fight against the forces of corrupt powers, where the officials raise taxes, commit embezzlement, and find many ways to inflict suffering on the people in the villages.</p>
<p>This game features the largest number of soldiers in the series to date, with enemy soldiers attacking in cooperation to make a formidable opponent, give players a real sense of challenge, and force them to make tactical decisions to beat their opponent. While you control one person, you are responsible for an entire army, and you'll have to fight against thousands of enemies on the battlefield while utilizing your skills.</p>
<p>Certain battles will require you to meet specific conditions. While working on completing them, you can temporarily take control of Guan Yu and other companions that will accompany you on the battlefield. Players are given free roam in the game and the choice of where they want to go. They can choose which battlefield they want to go to next.</p>
<p>So that fans can see what to expect from Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the general producer Akihiro Suzuki has collaborated with producer Tomohiko Sho to produce a video that outlines their expectations for Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which can be watched<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPpGffZEkgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on YouTube</a>. However, the YouTube video is in Japanese, and no captions or translations are available. Although many people won't be able to understand what is being said in the video, the video does showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to see in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>

Which means you still have a great excuse to stay indoors where it’s cool and dark, and where electricity abundantly flows for us to power our gaming machines. </p><p>This weekend we’re taking a look at a few games that have come out in recent years, as well as a few more recent ones too. Whether you’re looking to jump into a colossal new galaxy, an epic Japanese gangster saga, or a DOS-game classic, we think these picks are well worth your time. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck: OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Not burning myself out on it</p><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899">finally picked up <em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span><em> </em>and I don’t want to put it down, but I’ve been forcing myself to. As enthralling as it is, and as much fun as I’m having in 1980s Japan, these games are far too easy to burn out on, and I think that’s why I’m always hesitant to go all in on them. I first played <em>Judgment </em>after a bad breakup, and proceeded to devote every mind-numbing minute of the next few weeks to that game. I was physically exhausted from planting my ass on the couch for hours on end. <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon </em>came out two months later, and I played it till I felt empty inside and couldn’t stomach it anymore. To this day, I still haven’t beaten it.</p><p>I wound up reviewing both <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden </em>and <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and while the former was a much more relaxed (and thankfully brief experience) the latter nearly burnt me out at the very start of the year. These games are immense and all-consuming, which is both great and terrifying depending on the light in which you’re looking at it. Despite it all, I love this series and I want to experience the rest of Kiryu’s story from the beginning, so here we are. I’m a few chapters in, and enjoying the meticulous pace at which I’m absorbing the game. It’s like tuning in for a new episode of my favorite show every few nights. Given that it’s the weekend though, I’m planning on marathoning a few more installments than usual, while trying to make sure it doesn’t do too much psychic damage, or deprive me of water, food, some sunlight, and time with friends. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Sun</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Complete the existing campaign </p><p>I’ve had a hard time putting <em>Cataclismo</em> down and even when I do I’m still thinking about it.

It’s in Early Access and rough around the edges still—lots of missing quality of life features and some annoying bugs—but the bones are there and fantastic. You build towering defenses during the day and survive onslaughts of horrors at night. The aesthetic feels a bit like water color <em>Gormenghast</em> fan art, and the mood is post-apocalyptic gothic punk. One of the nicest features is that there are automatic time anchors at regular intervals. If you lose, the game makes it easy to navigate back to previous points in a match to fix your mistakes and chart a different course. It’s not quite save-scumming and it’s a big time saver. If you like building thick stone walls and ridiculously precarious medieval shanty towns, this is the game for you. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get past the fourth stage</p><p>When <em>Void Bastards</em> came out in 2019, I was super excited to play it, and then for reasons I’m not quite clear on, bounced off hard. However, this week I was playing a preview build of its spiritual successor, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and went back to the first to see how much overlap there is between the two roguelite shooters.</p><p>It turns out, apart from the wonderfully distinctive art-style, not a huge number. Both are games where you need to progress along <em>Slay The Spire</em>-style pathways, completing FPS challenges and gathering resources. But after that, they really have a distinct feel. <em>Void Bastards</em> is about exploring spaceships to steal useful items, and shoot the violent residents, desperately trying to return to your airlock before you run out of air or blood.</p><p>Replaying it this time, however, I’m totally in love. I accidentally stayed up playing until 1am last night. I’m planning to play it this weekend too. And maybe forever. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-recommend-id="image://7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-recommend-id="image://7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Enjoy one of the best Switch games to date (and have tea with Edelgard)</p><p>Did you know that today (July 26) is the five year anniversary of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a></span> releasing for Nintendo Switch? That’s as good as a reason as any to go play one of the best tactical RPGs ever made. If you’ve played it before or if you’ve never touched a<em> Fire Emblem</em> game in your life, you should still probably play some of <em>Three Houses</em> this weekend in celebration. </p><p><br><em>Three Houses</em> puts you in the shoes of a professor at the Garreg Mach Monastery officer’s school, and gives you the choice of which of the titular three houses to control. Each house has a charismatic leader and a loveable cast of students. Over the course of the game, through both tactical combat and laid-back tea breaks at the school, you get to build bonds with the game’s wonderfully written characters. The tactical combat also delivers. It’s pretty standard tactical fare but it’s executed well—it’s never overtly punishing or too easy. As we near the end of the Switch’s lifespan, <em>Three Houses</em> remains one of the best games the console has given us. — Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-recommend-id="image://3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="790" data-height="444" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Origin Systems</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-recommend-id="image://3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="790" data-height="444" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PC (Available on GOG)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Finally beat it after over 30 years</p><p>Each summer, the big online PC storefronts offer colossal sales that have thousands of gamers flocking to buy titles for 75 or 90 percent off, deals so good we can’t pass them up, even though, if we’re honest with ourselves, we may never get around to playing half of the games we buy in our mad shopping frenzy. And this year, it wasn’t Steam’s legendary summer sale that had me lusting to expand my library, but the one over at GOG.com. For whatever reason, lately I’ve been feeling the itch to experience older PC classics I missed out on when they first released, or to return to ones I never finished, and so this summer saw my GOG library expand to the tune of dozens of games, all picked up on the cheap. </p><p>And right now, the game in my GOG library that’s calling to me like no other is <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, the absolutely remarkable 1992 first-person role-playing game that made you feel immersed in its environments like no game had before. Considered by some the first example of an immersive sim, <em>Ultima Underworld </em>has had a level of influence and impact on the medium that few games can match. And although, of course, by today’s standards it all looks and feels pretty basic, for me there’s something really compelling about it all—the charm of its interface, with that gargoyle sneering over the gameplay window; the way the jagged, pixel-y graphics just make the stones of the dungeon look that more rough-hewn; the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sound Blaster</a></span>-ass music, which adapts on the fly to the kind of situation you’re in.

Though I appreciated and didn’t mind the state the game shipped in in 2016, a busy life kept me from sinking any meaningfully sustained time into this near-endless virtual galaxy. And then with all the updates, it just seemed impossible to know when to jump in for any meaningful amount of time. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276"><em>No Man’s Sky </em>Is Getting A Complete Universal Refresh In One Of Its Biggest Updates Ever</a></span></p><p>But both as a consequence of the recent improvements by way of Worlds Part I and the massive backlog of material I have to discover after so many free updates, <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is a massive, make-your-own-fun kind of sandbox that I just can’t resist. So this weekend will likely see me continue my efforts to keep building up my base and exploring the planets in the system I’m presently sticking to until it feels appropriate to move on. </p><p>I have to stress though how much I love the core foundation of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>: simply traveling and scouting, seamlessly flying from world to world, taking in new horizons, finding all sorts of emergent opportunities. It’s wonderful. The scale of this world also just makes me feel so small (especially in VR) and instills that joyous sense of wonder that I get from watching vintage <em>Cosmos</em> while, um, well. Under the influence of. Uh. stuff. And though I do wish the graphics were a touch more photorealistic, I’ve learned to love <em>NMS</em>’ cartoony, overly colorful look, especially on a vibrant screen where the very red grass of the planet I’ve been covering every inch of just pops with life. </p><p><br>Does the game still feel a little hollow in some ways? Sure. Could it have More To Do™, sure. (Past Expeditions, actually, <em>should</em> still be available to play). But ya’ll, just vibing in digital spaces is a valid way to enjoy one’s time. I don’t need to be chewing through content all the goddamn time. I like that <em>NMS</em> exists as a refuge for that. — Claire Jackson  </p><hr><p>And that wraps up our picks for this weekend.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Date Everything | Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The game features 100 dateable everyday objects, each of which are brought to life by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">(human) voice actor</a>. The voice cast includes quite a few well-known names, including Johnny Young Bosch, Felicia Day, Grey DeLisle, and more. Each romance has three different outcomes--the player can become the object's lover, their friend, or even their mortal enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">The 3D overworld changes as the game progresses, and according to Sassy Chap devs, these changes are based on the player's in-game decisions, suggesting some objects may not be so eager to serve their original purpose if the player burns them romantically. It's not hard to imagine the intense (and incredibly inconvenient) consequences of experiencing a bitter breakup with your refrigerator, and it's likely that hell hath no fury like a toaster scorned.</p><p dir="ltr">Date Everything also features:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Over four hours of original music, with each dateable item featuring a unique musical theme</li><li dir="ltr">1.2 million words and 70,000 lines of voiced dialogue</li><li dir="ltr">Over 11,000 hand-drawn images</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sassy Chap Games has yet to announce a release date for the game, but we do know that upon release, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/07/26/netflixs-bioshock-film-now-has-a-smaller-scope-due-to-budget-cuts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Netflix’s upcoming film adaptation of Bioshock is still happening, but it won’t be as grand as originally planned. During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.</p>

<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/">Variety</a></em>, producer Roy Lee (<em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em>, <em>The Lego Movie</em>) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/15/netflix-partnering-with-take-two-on-a-bioshock-film">announcement</a> in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (<em>I Am Legend</em>, <em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em>) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p>

<p>A partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life.&nbsp;In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (<em>Loga</em>, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, <em>American Gods</em>) was announced as its writer in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/08/25/netflix-has-found-a-director-and-writer-for-its-bioshock-movie">August 2022</a>.</p>

They’re abundantly available across most zones, allowing you to craft to your heart’s content and construct the base of your dreams. But that’s not the case the deeper you move into the game. As you reach mid-game and end-game content, you’ll find resources become more scarce, more necessary, and tougher to crack.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192516" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="192516,194644,193329" data-current="192516"><div><p>This Halo Infinite Map of Zelda’s Kokiri Forest Is Absurdly Detailed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192516/192516_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17972.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One such resource is Automatic Parts. It’s crucial in unlocking end-game blueprints. Unfortunately, it’s a rare resource only found in high-level zones, which makes farming more challenging unless you grind out levels.</p><p>Here is where to get Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em>!</p><h2 id="h1237"><a id="partsfor"></a>What are Automatic Parts for?</h2><figure id="" data-id="6a22984f05680c07fafe2590d61afb8d" data-recommend-id="image://6a22984f05680c07fafe2590d61afb8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a weapon crafting menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a weapon crafting menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a22984f05680c07fafe2590d61afb8d" data-recommend-id="image://6a22984f05680c07fafe2590d61afb8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a weapon crafting menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Automatic Parts are essential to unlock late-game crafting and construction recipes. The most direct use will be for better weapons if you want to stand a chance against the more formidable game. At tier five, weapons require Special Plastics and Automatic Parts—two rare resources that will be the bane of your gameplay until you learn the farming methods for each.</p><p>On top of weapon crafting, you’ll also need Automatic Parts for weapon calibration, which takes your weapons and improves upon them. By spending resources to calibrate your favorite weapons, you’ll increase their power level to a maximum of four, increasing the overall damage and occasionally adding attributes to your firearms.</p><h2 id="h1238"><a id="find"></a>Where to find Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-recommend-id="image://8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-recommend-id="image://8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can find Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em> from high-level zones, such as:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Blackfell Fallen Zone - Red Sands (Level 41)</li><li>Blackfell Oil Fields - Red Sands (Level 43)</li><li>Fort Eyrie - Red Sands (Level 45)</li><li>Forsaken Monolith Danger Zone - Red Sands (Level 50)</li></ul><p>Are you noticing a trend? Easily, the best spot to farm Automatic Parts in the game is the Red Sands zone, which unlocks once you defeat Shadow Hound at the Monolith of Thirst. </p><p>As you explore Red Sands thoroughly, on top of occasionally running for your life from challenging enemies never seen in the game’s previous zones, you’ll wind up looting the occasional cabinet or storage container with Automatic Parts. You can find a small handful by looting buildings, but it’s not enough. You’ll require more.</p><figure id="" data-id="f88749fac86ae550d7c50047ecb267dc" data-recommend-id="image://f88749fac86ae550d7c50047ecb267dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character loots an abandoned bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character loots an abandoned bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f88749fac86ae550d7c50047ecb267dc" data-recommend-id="image://f88749fac86ae550d7c50047ecb267dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character loots an abandoned bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Loot those and grab everything you can. Snag every piece of scrap and junk you can find; it all breaks down at a Disassembly Bench. That’s where you’ll you farm Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em>. It’s a resource that stems from junk items, such as:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Military Flash Drives</li><li>Dual Purpose Binoculars</li><li>Custom Tool Set</li><li>Grease Gun</li></ul><p>Anything mechanical or military-grade should provide you with Automatic Parts!</p><hr><p>Like most aspects of <em>Once Human</em>, the hunt for Automatic Parts proves to be a circle. You need Automatic Parts to craft and upgrade your weapons. You need more potent weaponry to farm the late-game areas where Automatic Parts spawn. Hopefully, however, Blackfell doesn’t prove too challenging for you!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The open beta for Valorant on Xbox Series  X|S is now available. Microsoft and Riot Games <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/">confirmed the release</a> via a post on Xbox Wire Friday morning.</p>



<p>In the post announcing the beta’s launch, it was discussed why the game’s move to console was “no simple port”.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Gameplay Trailer - VALORANT" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAkFklRvhjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Riot is sparing no effort in bringing the title to Xbox,” Xbox’s Evan Shamoon says. <br>“Primarily, that comes through reproducing the finely-tuned balance that’s made the PC title such a hit – the team went through many iterations of translating the original mouse-and-keyboard controls to gamepad input.”</p>



<p>“We’re getting to the starting line as we like to say,” executive producer Andy Ho told Shamoon. “This is a game that we don’t have an end date in mind for. We want to invest in it on an infinite horizon, so that players feel like their investment into the game is always going to be worth it.”</p>



<p>Valorant has already had a beta on PlayStation 5 back in June, and it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1djfqps/console_beta_is_too_fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">received positive reviews</a> from players. Once the Xbox beta is complete, there should be more of an idea as to when the full release of Valorant on consoles will come.</p>



<p>If you do play in the Xbox beta and are a Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-members-get-extra-valorant-perks-riot-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">access to all agents</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-gaming-words</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cambridge-dictionary%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-words-are-kind-of-a-mess.937824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-gaming-words<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Cambridge Dictionary has shared a list of over 3000 words it's added to its dictionary this year, and the new words under the gaming category are...questionable, to say the least.</p>
<p>In a post on its website, the Cambridge Dictionary runs down some of the new words it's added to its ranks so far in 2024, with categories like "slang and informal language", "music", and "modern life" all getting new additions.</p>
<p>Of course, "gaming" is also one of the categories, and new words that have been added to the dictionary in this vein this year include "MMORPG", "PvP", and "speedrun", to name but a few.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=q6nIM3RZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=E0XzzYDi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"MMORPG" is one of the Cambridge Dictionary's new words.</figcaption></figure><p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines "speedrun" as completing a game "as quickly as possible, especially by taking advantage of any glitches", which is mostly fine.</p>
<p>"Side quest", meanwhile, is defined as "a part of a computer game that hs its own aim and story but is not part of the main game". I guess we can let that one slide, although there are plenty of pedantic things we could say about it.</p>
<p>Things get a little weird, though, when we look at the Dictionary's definition for "PvP". The definition itself is a touch wobbly, referring to a game in which "there are many players who are each other's opponents", which feels a bit off. Is&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>not a PvP game when played offline?</p>
<p>The example, though, is where things break down a little. The Dictionary's example reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t enjoy PvP, how about PvE, or “player versus engine”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, that's not what PvE stands for, but the strange thing is that the Cambridge Dictionary does get this right on the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pve" rel="noopener" target="_blank">actual definition page for PvE</a>, referring to "player versus environment". How strange!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=pl0Cv8yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=GY5Rnn2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>might struggle to qualify as a PvP game under the Cambridge Dictionary's definition.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, though. The Cambridge Dictionary lists "backread" as one of its online gaming-related words, but the definition of backread simply relates to scrolling through a backlog of group messages to catch up with the latest info.</p>
<p>"Backread" doesn't feel like an explicitly gaming-related word, which is probably why it also appears in the "internet" category, but "review bomb", which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic">almost inarguably</a> applies to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response">games as well</a>, seems absent from the gaming word group. Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm just ribbing the Cambridge Dictionary, but its list of new words is genuinely fascinating, so make sure to check out <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/news-and-insights/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-words-2024#group-section-Gaming-Ph8PE2Sagz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a> for a few more, including amusing entries like "chef's kiss", "porch piracy", and "microsleep".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, it initially seemed like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203959/intel-core-13th-14th-gen-cpu-crash-update-patch">beginning of the end for Intel’s desktop CPU instability woes</a> — the company confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should address the “root cause” of exposure to elevated voltage. But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already crashing, that patch apparently won’t fix it. </p><p>Citing unnamed sources,<em> </em><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-finally-announces-a-solution-for-cpu-crashing-errors-claims-elevated-voltages-are-the-root-cause-fix-coming-by-mid-august"><em>Tom’s Hardware </em>reports</a> that any degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is “confident” the patch will keep it from happening in the first place. (As another preventative measure, you should update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the problems. </p><p>And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren’t the only reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson Thomas Hannaford confirms it’s <em>a</em> primary cause, but the company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1e9mf04/comment/lefz09c/">traced back to an oxidization manufacturing issue</a> that was fixed at an unspecified date last year.</p><p>This raises lots of questions. Will Intel recall these chips? Extend their warranty? Replace them no questions asked? Pause sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205416/amd-zen-5-ryzen-9000-desktop-delay">like AMD just did</a> with its Ryzen 9000?

It will not do a recall, period. The company is not currently commenting on whether or how it might extend its warranty. It would not share estimates with <em>The Verge</em> of how many chips are likely to be irreversibly impacted, and it did not explain why it’s continuing to sell these chips ahead of any fix. </p><p>Intel’s not yet telling us how warranty replacements will work beyond trying customer support again if you’ve previously been rejected. It did not explain how it will contact customers with these chips to warn them about the issue.</p><p>But Intel <em>does</em> tell us it’s “confident” that you don’t need to worry about invisible degradation. If you’re not currently experiencing issues, the patch “will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service.” (If you don’t know if you’re experiencing issues, Intel currently suggests <a href="https://youtu.be/wkrOYfmXhIc?si=XzCym6UjLcF3_yW2&amp;t=497">the Robeytech test</a>.)</p><p>And, perhaps for the first time, Intel has confirmed just how broad this issue could possibly be.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-update-to-morrowind-like-rpg-dread-delusion-adds-a-big-nautilus-with-a-town-built-inside-its-shell.937818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-update-to-morrowind-like-rpg-dread-delusion-adds-a-big-nautilus-with-a-town-built-inside-its-shell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>In a recent interview, the director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> said that if you made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> today, it would struggle to find an audience. "If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This "final content update" will add the Cephalok, "a magical creature filled with rare materials, where legends tell of some Wikkans who built a castle inside of its shell." To get inside the floating beast you'll need to have unlocked the airship. Naturally, there'll be some new enemies to deal with, but also "powerful, late-game items" like weapons and equipment, plus "new airship components to further customize your flying vessel".</p>
<p>There's also a "hard mode" included in the update, which will see your attacks and spells costing more stamina and mana to perform, while enemies will also hit harder and attack in groups. Items and ingredients will also be rarer, say developers Lovely Hellplace, which presumably means you'll have to be more judicious about healing and such. All this comes after last week's big performance patch, which fixed a lot of smaller things like FPS drops when entering new regions.</p>
<p>I admit picking on TESO director Matt Firor's quote from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-checklist-conquered-the-open-world-from-morrowind-to-skyrim">Edwin's recent musings on the open world genre</a> is not entirely fair. For one thing, there is a map <em>and</em> a compass in Dread Delusion. It's not a particularly clear map (a big ongoing quest involves finding the landmarks required to fill in all the blank spaces for the cartographer's guild). But it is one concession to players keen to experience the Morrowindy RPG without getting hopelessly lost. That aside, Dread Delusion is a game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">trusts the player to discover the weirdness of its world</a> at their own pace. It takes an old-school approach that modern open world games (like those from Bethesda) don't follow because, as Firor's words suggest, they are often preoccupied with selling to a broad audience. </p>
<p>Dread Delusion doesn't want a broad audience. It wants the kind of people who think mushrooms ought to be twelve feet tall and luminous. It wants an audience of sickos who will pledge allegiance to a moaning god suspended from the rafters of an abandoned house like a sac of spider eggs. It desires a player who will see a giant nautilus floating in the sky and think: "I bet there's something weird inside that big lad."</p>

First, Bethesda Game Studios successfully formed a “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/bethesda-game-studios-form-wall-to-wall-union-at-microsoft">wall-to-wall union</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” at Microsoft— consisting of more than 200 employees across multiple disciplines—in the lingering shadow of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-microsoft-follows-activision-blizzard-merger-with-1-900-layoffs">major layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-closes-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-alpha-dog-studios">studio closures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earlier this year. And not long thereafter, the entire development staff of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> formed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/over-500-blizzard-entertainment-workers-form-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at Blizzard Entertainment, another Microsoft-owned company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about the organization movement sweeping our industry, Game Developer Senior Editor Bryant Francis spoke to Emma Kinema of the Communications Workers of America, which spearheaded both of this week’s accomplishments, as well as Autumn Mitchell and Chris Lusco of Bethesda Softworks, to get the inside perspective on why unions are useful, how they function, the deal with all those bad unions you keep hearing about, and a lot more. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Produced by Jordan Mallory and with music by Mike Meehan, this is episode 45 of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every conversation about unions (video game or otherwise) comes with its own complementary elephant in the room: Aren’t unions bad, actually? Don’t they just make it harder to do your job? Well according to Kinema, a union is only as good as the people at the helm, just like any other democratic institution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations">Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There's an argument to be said that the democratic functions [of a union] can be taken over for bad means—it's true,” Kinema said. “And there is a rich history of labor organizing, especially dating far back into like the twenties through the sixties, where there were issues with, for instance, the mafia getting involved with the teamsters.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But such instances are often the result of institutional and exterior influence, according to Kinema. “Often that was the police working with the mafia to infiltrate and take over leadership of those unions, and usually that followed when there was previous progressive or socialist leadership of those unions who then got purged because of government regulations [and] ‘red scare’ type stuff.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So you have to understand that history,” she said. “When you purge progressive leadership from the union movement, what follows is reactionary leadership in the union movement, right?”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions can lead to meaningful change">Unions can lead to meaningful change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell argues that in the right hands, a union can not only affect meaningful change in an individual’s workplace, but also for everyone else working in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Unions are huge for pushing workers’ rights to legislation,” she said. “Workers unions are why we have ‘eight hours a day, five days a week,’ they're why we have child labor laws, they're why we have sick leave, paternity leave, maternity leave.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it has to be a concerted effort, she adds. “It's not like one little union from a Kentucky coal mine decided ‘Hey, I only want to do eight hours a day.’ That took way more, they had to get together. They all had to work together to accomplish that and to achieve that and to push for legislation for that to become reality.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendants-new-major-content-update-is-releasing-early/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816820774793335103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nexon announced that the anticipated Week 5 Update for The First Descendant will now release early on July 31, 2024.</p>



<p>Nexon originally planned to release the update just a day later on August 1, 2024. So, it isn’t arriving much earlier than previously expected, but the move can still be rare.</p>



<p>Also, Nexon further revealed a look at the Ult Valby cosmetic. The footage was purely cinematic and did not include any new gameplay. As seen in today’s brief teaser, the Ult Valby has a more suggestive look than previous cosmetics.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📢Big News: The Week 5 Update is coming to Albion a day earlier<br>Be ready to dive into the crystal-clear waves with Ult Valby on 7/31! 🌊✨ <a href="https://t.co/chXjRybAsu">pic.twitter.com/chXjRybAsu</a></p>— The First Descendant (@FirstDescendant) <a href="https://twitter.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816820774793335103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The Week 5 update will introduce new Descendants, gear, balancing changes, and more. Nexon recently teased an image of Luna <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1816413089207857305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, a new descendant described as a “buff-type supporter” who uses music for their special abilities.</p>



<p>Nexon elaborated on the Week 5 update with an <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2608718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official preview</a> yesterday. There will be a new Peace Mediator weapon, Arche Concretion module, the “mutated Devourer-type Gluttony,” and more.</p>



<p>The First Descendant recently faced some fan backlash over similarities to Destiny 2 imagery. However, the developers promptly issued <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-developer-issues-response-over-destiny-2-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a clear response</a>, and committed to adjustments for related content.</p>



<p>Nexon also recently announced that the new third-person looter shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 10 million players</a> across all platforms in a single week. </p>

This mass layoff did not solely affect its immediate staff, but also the developers and games under the publisher, such as the developer of Coral Island now facing uncertainty regarding its Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation versions.</p><p>Developer Stairway Games revealed in a statement that the Humble Games layoffs have left it unable to release updates for the console versions of its game, due to Humble typically handling them. The team explained that an incoming hotfix is unable to be released outside of Steam and that they really "have no idea" how to release this update to console players due to the lack of backend permissions on those platforms. Stairway also acknowledged the long wait for the Switch port, which was announced for 2024, but has yet to be released.</p><p>You can read the full statement below, in which the developer acknowledges the situation "f***ing sucks."</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previously raised $1.5 million</a> and reached its Kickstarter stretch goal for console and Switch. As a make-good to those who backed the Kickstarter to receive a Switch key, Stairway is offering replacement keys on Steam.</p><p>Some of the noteworthy games published by Humble Games previously include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-hat-in-time/" data-ref-id="5000-248933">A Hat in Time</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carto/" data-ref-id="5000-505832">Carto</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/one-step-from-eden/" data-ref-id="5000-489002">One Step From Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forager/" data-ref-id="5000-479738">Forager</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/slay-the-spire-review-trend-setter/1900-6417497/" data-ref-id="1900-6417497">Slay the Spire</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/temtem/" data-ref-id="5000-482689">Temtem</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/moonscars/" data-ref-id="5000-560764">Moonscars</a>.</p><p>This is not the first time mass layoffs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">have occurred within the games industry in the past year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>V Publishing and Bad Ridge Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>release date, and the game, developed by a two-man indie outfit, will be out later this year.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a life sim that offers a spicy dash of morality alongside the usual farming, getting to know the townspeople, and cozy adventuring, and it's launching on PC on September 11th. There's no word on a console version just yet.</p>
<p>The devs explicitly cite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>&nbsp;(that's the originals, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025">new Xbox project</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4">The Sims</a>&nbsp;</em>as inspirations for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, so if any of those games are your jam, this one should be on your radar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=JGdbKIRo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=fUVq8xkT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>will have a few unusual twists on top of its farming sim gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>You begin as an adventurer who's fleeing "a continent swept with war" and looking for a fresh start. However, somewhat unusually for a life sim, that fresh start doesn't have to be a morally upstanding one.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>blends typical life sim gameplay - managing and upgrading a farmstead, exploring the local environs for monsters to slay (in a cozy way, obviously), and meeting townsfolk - with a morality system inspired by&nbsp;<em>inFamous&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge says you'll be able to take either a good or an evil path through&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and presumably, villagers' responses to you will change depending on what kind of person you are.</p>
<p>You can add&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Don't Starve&nbsp;</em>to the list of inspirations&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>can claim, by the way, as this release date trailer will attest to.</p>

<p>When you interact with villagers, you'll do so via a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-inspired interaction system that lets you choose from a variety of different conversation topics, and building relationships will also potentially unlock new quests for you to chase.</p>
<p>In short, while&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>offers yet more cozy game-style shenanigans, it looks like it's doing enough to differentiate itself from the legions of its peers currently harvesting their crops and romancing the townspeople.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on Steam right now</a> ahead of its September 11th launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions.937767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The 7th Continent, a game that emerged from a wildly successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> campaign, has not only met but exceeded the high expectations initially set for it. It's an immersive game that draws inspiration from choose-your-own-adventure novels, video games, as well as legendary authors Jules Verne and H.P. Lovecraft. It's not just one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>best cooperative board games</u></a> but also an exhilarating solo experience that has earned its place among the medium’s finest.</p><p>As with other successful board games, The 7th Continent has seen several expansions that further iterate upon the core gameplay and add more harrowing scenarios. Given the number of releases over the years, however, it might be difficult to decide which packages to consider and in which order. That’s why we have crafted this handy buying guide that will walk you through the various releases and what each offers. Luckily, starting isn’t too difficult as there is really only one place to begin, the base game.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="the-7th-continent"><h3 data-toc-title="The 7th Continent">The 7th Continent</h3></p><div catalogid="0337b024-a14d-4c5b-8a95-55c3c3d47e1e" id="205233"><div id="205233" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $69.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-4</li><li>Play Time: 5-1000 mins</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent is a heavily thematic board game that immerses players in the story of explorers returning to the newly discovered titular land. Together, they must remove a curse placed upon them during their last expedition. The continent, still largely uncharted, remains treacherous and mysterious, unfolding before players as they explore. The game doesn’t give players much direction when it comes to lifting the curse. Instead, players are dropped into a dangerous world, asked to explore, and must deal with various perils as they appear. This enveloping narrative, combined with the game's unique mechanics, creates a challenging and captivating experience.</p><p>Mechanically speaking, The 7th Continent is a narrative-driven card game with an expanding board of tiles that are placed when players meet various requirements. Like other explorative survival board games, it features crafting, combat, and even RPG elements. However, it’s The 7th Continent’s unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles in the genre, making it an unforgettable experience. For example, the card deck players draw from to resolve actions and add to their respective hands also serves as their life force. Once players work their way through the deck, they risk pulling a curse card, ending the game and resulting in a loss. Also, you might notice that campaigns can run quite long; luckily, however, The 7th Continent includes a handy save feature that allows players to pause, pack up the contents, and pick up the story at a later time. Still, due to its length, it might be difficult to get the same group of players together, but you can also take The 7th Continent at your own pace as a single-player campaign, considering it is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>best solo board games</u></a> currently available.</p><p>The various curses in the box make up the scenarios, and there are four alone in the base game—each of which takes players hours to complete. Multiple curses can be combined in the same campaign to add even more variability to the base game. With plenty of random events baked in, the Core Box offers plenty of replayability on its own, but players looking to revisit the mystifying world on multiple occasions may want to check out one of The 7th Continent’s several expansions.</p><h2>Main Expansions</h2></div><p id="crystals-songgame-modes-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Crystal's Song/Game Modes Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="ce12b08d-8d49-4133-93ac-48fa4e1c20b2" id="205235"><div id="205235" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $12.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>3 New Game Modes</li><li>1 Divider</li><li>40 New Cards</li></ul><p>While The Voracious Goddess curse in the Core Box was initially the recommended starting point for new players, The Crystal’s Song curse in this expansion has since become the ideal first scenario thanks to its brief and tutorial-esque introduction to The 7th Continent’s mechanics. In fact, publisher Serious Poulp bundles The Crystal’s Song and the Core Box together as a starter pack. Additionally, the expansion includes an easier Prodigy Mode, an advanced Immortal Mode, and a tense Traitor Mode that gives players secret objectives. Not only is this the first expansion most players should pick up, but it’s actually a recommended purchase alongside the base game if possible.</p></div><p id="the-icy-maze-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Icy Maze Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="c8df1164-8e0a-4d52-a44d-00829d7f204e" id="205238"><div id="205238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent Website actually recommends playing The Icy Maze before The Bloody Hunt – the last curse in the Core Box, which requires an in-depth knowledge of the map and mechanics. It’s certainly not a requirement to play The Icy Maze before finishing the base game, or at all, even, but if you feel that cutting your teeth on the more advanced Bloody Hunt is trying your patience, just know it’s designed too. The Icy Maze places an emphasis on movement, eventually giving players a greater understanding of the various corners of the continent.</p></div><p id="the-forbidden-sanctuary-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6006ab1f-937c-49c8-9805-67d12c8bc070" id="205239"><div id="205239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The Forbidden Sanctuary is the next recommended curse from the makers of The 7th Continent. This curse takes players to a mysterious temple riddled with booby traps. Learning the secrets hidden inside can be treacherous, but it’s necessary to lift the curse. Like the other expansions listed here, The Forbidden Sanctuary is designed to fit right into the Core Box and requires the base game.</p></div><p id="the-veins-of-the-earth-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Veins of the Earth Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="af25c1a2-53b8-4a43-8249-1ece716cec6b" id="205240"><div id="205240" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>149 New Cards</li><li>Barge Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>The Veins of the Earth expansion gives players a look at what lurks below the continent. Underground waterways span the entire continent, which players will discover as they float along on their barge. The added layer to this mysterious land is accompanied by its own set of perils for explorers to stumble across. Initially, The Veins of the Earth was bundled with A Prison of Clouds, Forgotten Passages, and The Crystal’s Song in a collector’s expansion box available through Kickstarter. All of these, except for The Crystal’s Song, can still be purchased in the What Goes Up, Must Come Down bundle – a nod to the title of the original expansion title.</p></div><p id="a-prison-of-clouds-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="A Prison of Clouds Expansion">The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="454603f2-2491-4269-99c0-8b2daf2dfe7a" id="205241"><div id="205241" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>169 New Cards</li><li>Hot Air Baloon Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>While The Veins of the Earth explored the underground passages of the continent, A Prison of Clouds has players taking to the skies in a hot air balloon. The two expansions together serve to expand the map vertically, and A Prison of Clouds even allows players to land on the continent whenever they choose and explore on foot. In fact, it’s a necessary excursion as you will certainly face strong headwinds and intense hunger along your journey that will require you to trek on foot for a bit.</p></div><p id="forgotten-passages-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Forgotten Passages Expansion">The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="a65f4dde-7f3d-49df-8f84-6dff2313cbdf" id="205242"><div id="205242" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>3 New Explorers</li><li>115 New Cards</li><li>3 Character Standees</li></ul><p>While Forgotten Passages doesn’t include any new curses against which players can test their skills and luck, the expansion does include plenty of new cards and three new explorers with various abilities. Joining the cast are the skilled hunter Anjika, American aviator Amelia Earhart, and English Gentleman Phileas Fogg, along with his valet Jean Passerpartout. Not to mention, new alternate terrain cards change up the map enough to keep players on their toes.</p></div><p id="facing-the-elements-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Facing the Elements Expansion">The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="33a51758-e1e8-43a7-8e36-ee6dc3e93e8f" id="205245"><div id="205245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>5 Cardboard Figures</li><li>5 Plastic Stands</li></ul><p>As if curses and traps weren’t enough, Facing the Elements adds various acts of nature to the world of The 7th Continent. These random events can throw a wrench in your excursion entirely, or they can perhaps aid you in your exploration. Again, there’s no new curse here, but these wild card events can help keep things interesting and add even more depth to an already content-rich game.</p></div><p id="fear-the-devourers-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Fear the Devourers Expansion">The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="d59ac834-1997-40b3-9029-e05a94dd27ad" id="205246"><div id="205246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li><li>7 Rock Worm Standees</li></ul><p>Fear the Devourers adds the fearsome Rockworm to The 7th Continent. These random exploration cards fold right into the base game and can pose quite a challenge. If not immediately dealt with, these creatures will remain a persistent threat. Players who want a bit of extra challenge added to the base game without a ton of extra rules should check out Fear the Devourers.</p></div><p id="the-flying-roots-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Flying Roots Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="fd1c2bf2-ba5a-4d18-8e66-849625fc1060" id="205247"><div id="205247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>6 Flying Roots Standees</li></ul><p>Like Fear the Devourers, The Flying Roots adds another interesting element to the base game. Unlike the Rockworms, however, it’s initially unclear what the flying roots’ intentions actually are. While these plants aren’t necessarily nefarious, their presence can serve as quite a hindrance. This new mysterious addition is perhaps a bit deeper and has more in store for players who choose to investigate them further.</p><h2>Mini-Expansions</h2></div><p id="path-of-repentance-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Path of Repentance Expansion">The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="2f018944-4f91-4740-a540-3d87bdf1a905" id="205249"><div id="205249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Path of Repentance is a small but meaningful expansion that further deepens the thematic experience of The 7th Continent. This mini-expansion builds upon the sleep mechanic from the base game but goes the extra mile to illustrate just how mentally distraught the crew is over the looming curse. To speak too much about the Path of Repentance would spoil the experience, but just know that, especially at $10, this mini-expansion is well worth the price of admission.</p></div><p id="comfort-creatures-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Comfort Creatures Expansion">The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="7c9fcb34-e17f-4f6a-882f-a8c088f6a168" id="205250"><div id="205250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Comfort Creatures inserts a bit more randomness and fun into the 7th Continent experience. This mini-expansion adds an egg that will hatch into a mysterious creature if cared for. Hatch and raise the newborn beast to potentially gain a powerful companion to aid you on your journeys across the strange land.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The 7th Continent is an excellent cooperative board game for small groups and a great solo experience as well. The base game is required for all expansions, many of which add new curses that can either replace or supplement the base scenarios. Other expansions add new players, foes, and mechanics. The Crystal’s Song is a great purchase alongside the base game, as it helps onboard new players with its streamlined tutorial scenario.</p><p>For even more great tabletop recommendations, see our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games to play right now</u></a>.

They will send you back to your farm with a farm totem for 250G. <strong>Buying this uses it instantly--you cannot buy farm totems from the shrouded figure without instantly using them.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Night Market vendors</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4338163-nightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4338163" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4338163-nightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4338163"></a><figcaption>The Night Market vendors sell a few unique items only found here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4338163-nightmarket.jpg"></figure><p>The blue decoration boat sells a selection of decorations that you can buy. Nothing here is particularly rare, with a large selection of potted plants and candy cane decorations. The stock stays the same every night.</p><p dir="ltr">The famous painter Lupini is at the Night Market, selling a painting for 1,200G. The painting selection rotates each night, with the offerings changing every year on a three-year cycle, for a total of nine unique paintings.</p><p dir="ltr">The Magic Shop boat has a selection of decorations, seeds, and rarecrows. This vendor has two unique items you can only get from them: the cone hat and iridium fireplace. Outside of that there is a rotating selection of seeds. The seeds cost the same as they do at Pierre's, so it can be a good opportunity to get out of season seeds.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-traveling-cart-guide/1100-6524808/" data-ref-id="1100-6524808">Traveling Cart</a> is also at the Night Market, offering a randomized selection of goods each night. The selection is fully random, just like normal. There aren't any unique items guaranteed to be there, but it is three extra opportunities for them to randomly sell an item you might be looking for.</p>

                <p>Actor Kit Harington is returning to the world of Game of Thrones, but not in the way you'd expect or even probably hope for. The actor has returned to promote the Game of Thrones: Legends mobile game via a cheeky advertisement filled with references to his character, Jon Snow.</p><p>Harington said in a statement (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-legends-game-1235956085/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via THR</a>) that Legends is a "true love letter to fans" and that he is "honored to pay tribute" to fans via the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrEJ5zBlcQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nyrEJ5zBlcQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A match-three Bejeweled-esque game, Legends is developed by Zynga, which is owned by GTA parent company Take-Two. The game has players assembling characters from the Thrones universe, including Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Rhaenyra Targaryen, as they put together a team to try to stop the Long Night.</p><p>Like Zynga's other games, Legends is a free-to-play title supported by microtransactions. You can download Legends now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-legends-rpg/id1575445835?shortlink=wu2q0w2i&amp;c=ios_BRMK&amp;pid=Web&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.gotm&amp;shortlink=9pq04eb3&amp;c=android_BRMK&amp;pid=Web&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>.</p><p>Harington toyed with the idea of coming back to play Jon Snow again in a new TV series he was working on with George R.R. Martin. However, he recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-series-not-moving-ahead/1100-6522521/" data-ref-id="1100-6522521">confirmed the show is no longer moving ahead.</a></p>
