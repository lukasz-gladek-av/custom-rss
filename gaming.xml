			<p>Another Thursday means another <strong><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-linux/">GeForce NOW Thursday,</a></strong> with ten new games entering <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> cloud gaming service, led by the mountain climbing narrative game <strong>Cairn</strong> and <strong>The Bard's Tale Trilogy</strong>, while the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-available-linux-fire-tv-clients-more-games/"><strong>Linux-native</strong> GeForce NOW app enters beta</a>.</p>



<p>Cairn is the latest game from <strong>The Game Bakers</strong>, the indie team behind games like <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/423230/Furi/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Furi</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983970/Haven/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Haven</a></strong>. It continues the studio's tradition of sticking to making something completely new genre-wise, while keeping a strong narrative focus. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Wccftech's Most Anticipated Adventure Games</a> for the year, and it's out today on PC and PS5. It's even already a game of the year contender, if early reviews are to be believed. It's also one of the five games that are <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> for GeForce NOW users.</p>



<p>As for the other brand-new RTX 5080-ready games, players will be able to take full advantage of the power of an RTX 5080 with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-walkers-zombie-fps-november-early-access-release-steam-next-fest/">first-person extraction zombie shooter, <strong>The Midnight Walkers</strong></a>, the physics-based medieval combat simulator <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half-Sword</a></strong>, and the open-world adventure <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191500/Vampires_Bloodlord_Rising/">Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</a></strong>. The final RTX 5080-ready game is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-death-stranding-space-marine-2-talos-principle-2/">now available to <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>subscribers</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Linux-native GeForce NOW app has officially entered its beta phase this week, with the desktop app going "<em>beyond the earlier Linux experience that was tuned specifically for Steam Decks,</em>" NVIDIA writes, as this app (available for <strong>Ubuntu 24.04 and later</strong>) makes it easier than ever to use GeForce NOW on Linux devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has released its financial statement for 2025, as well as for the fourth quarter of the year specifically, and it looks like <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 </em>wasn't exactly the success the studio hoped for.</p><p>In a press release summarizing the studio's year, Paradox reports a fall in profits of 162% for the fourth quarter when compared to the previous year, as well as an 80% drop for the year as a whole.</p><p>Paradox doesn't specifically blame <em>Bloodlines 2</em> for the year's disappointing figure, but it does point to "amortization and write-downs of [the game]" for the fourth quarter, so it's not a big stretch to imagine that <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor performance had a knock-on effect for 2025 as a whole, too.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was a big letdown for Paradox last year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Revenues for the quarter technically increased, driven largely by Paradox's strategy-focused back catalog (as well as the newly-released <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94d6591e-5da9-4df4-85db-66063c38e046" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">first teased in May last year</a>), but sales for the year as a whole remained static when compared to last year.</p><p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admits that <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>"did not meet [the company's] commercial expectations", but he says his studio is now reassessing its resource allocation to ensure it focuses on the right projects in future.</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released in October following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very lengthy</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">troubled development cycle</a>. The game was met with criticism for its perceived lack of similarities to Troika's original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</em>, as well as shallow gameplay and a lack of meaningful RPG elements.</p><p>The game's poor reception led Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of developer The Chinese Room, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggest that the project's name was ill-fitting</a>, and that he and another former <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>producer attempted to convince execs "to not call it <em>Bloodlines 2</em>". Evidently, those efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>

The title, which launched in October 2025, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2">feels like a return to form</a>, according to our reviewer Charles Pulliam-Moore, and continues to push the series out of its iterative rut. At this price, the game is cheaper than the original Switch version (but pro tip: the Switch 2 cartridge will work in the original Switch, too, and will let you play the full game as if it were a regular Switch cart).</p><p>For those who haven’t jumped into a Pokémon game in a while, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> follows the formula that <em>Arceus</em> introduced. Rather than strictly operating as a turn-based RPG, the player can engage in real-time battles against Pokémon — even catching them sneakily without engaging in a fight is possible. Personally, games like <em>Pokémon Sword / Shield </em>burned me out on the idea of playing another, as it felt similar to playing previous titles, but with better graphics and a larger world. But shaking up how you engage with the core mechanics sounds like a good time.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you need an affordable-but-good MagSafe charging puck to recharge your iPhone while you’re in bed or working, <strong>Anker’s MagGo Qi2 puck with 15W charging</strong> is $14.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMH2JVMM/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in black or white. Sure, there are chargers out there that can go up to 25W (a speed that’s available only for iPhone 16 and 17 models), but that will significantly boost the price. Keep in mind that this puck doesn’t include a power adapter, so you’ll need to provide your own, or you can plug it directly into your laptop.</span></li><li><span>Some may choose to go for a modest TV upgrade in time for the Super Bowl. If you’re someone who likes to live más, perhaps the TV for you is <strong>TCL’s massive 98-inch QM6K QD-mini-LED 4K TV with Google TV software</strong> built-in. This model originally sold for $2,299.99, but you can grab it for $1,698.98 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DSR9N3M2/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> (or a dollar more at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Ftcl-98-class-qm6k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2FJ36QYTQ5JG%2Fsku%2F6617499" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>) now, and be assured: it will arrive in time for the Super Bowl on February 8th. The QM6K supports up to 144Hz refresh rate, meaning it’s great for console and PC gaming. One thing to note, however, is that it has a matte anti-reflective screen. However, the matte high vertical alignment (HVA) panel still boasts a very high contrast ratio.</span></li><li><span>It might be a while until we see deals on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/867757/apple-airtag-new-uwb-bluetooth-range-speaker">new <strong>second-gen Apple AirTags</strong></a> that are as good as what we’ve seen on the previous model.

<p>Building on the arcadey cyberpunk gangland arse-kicking of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/598550/HUNTDOWN/">predecessor</a>, Huntdown: Overtime puts a roguelite twist on the carnage, with cybernetically-enhanced bounty hunter John Sawyer taking out as many targets as he can per run, before being dragged back to a cyber-doc's operating table on death. As you go, you'll murderdeath a lot of foes and gradually unfurl Sawyer's origin story by morphing from mostly man, part killer toaster to mostly killer toaster, part man.</p>
<p>"We've tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick," said Tommy Gustafsson, art director at devs Easy Trigger Games. "Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run."</p><p>The devs promise "multiple paths through gang territories, wastelands, and more" to help keep things fresh, in addition to weapons ranging from fists of fury, to fully automatic rifles, massive snipers, and explosives. The likes of flamethrowers, miniguns, and futuristic  beam or plasma shooters look to await those who rise up the killer toaster ranks.</p>
<p>"This hits a sweet spot for me," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huntdown-preview-retro-game">2017 preview</a> of the first Huntdown. "On one level, it's not a particularly exciting game, doing things that I've been familiar with for a long time and lacking any specific hook. But at another level, it's one of those retro games that's actually far more detailed than any of the things that it remembers. As I was talking to the developer, I suddenly remembered a 'similar looking' game called After The War that I hadn't thought about since I was a kid. 'It's the same kind of future world, though in After The War a nuclear bomb has been dropped', I explained as I searched the internet for an image."</p>
<p>Huntdown: Overtime's scheduled to drop in early access in Q2 2026, which'd put in somewhere between April 1st and June 30th by my googling. If you fancy, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/">Steam</a>.</p>

According to Schreier, Bloomberg News learned about the departure yesterday, which comes as Amazon reportedly retreats from the PC and console video game space in favor of its cloud gaming service, Luna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news was shared after Amazon announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026">its latest round of job cuts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a message to employees, later posted on the Amazon website, which will impact around 16,000 roles across the company. Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, didn't clarify which sectors and divisions are impacted. Game Developer reached out to Amazon Game Studios for clarification.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, the official line is that Amazon will continue "hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions" that are "critical" to the company's future. "We're still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there's significant opportunity ahead," Galetti wrote one paragraph after announcing the 16,000 job cuts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-retains-optimism-in-vr-after-reality-labs-loses-83-6-billion-in-six-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Meta retains 'optimism' in VR after Reality Labs loses $83.6 billion in six years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, the SVP said that announcing broad reductions every few months isn't the plan. Yet, every team will "continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers," and make adjustments "as appropriate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This new wave of layoffs is taking place mere three months after Amazon made approximately 14,000 people redundant within its corporate workforce, a decision which included staff within its video game division. At the time, Galetti said the aim is to operate like the "world's largest startup" and eliminating bureaucracy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs," she wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after the announcement, Amazon Games announced the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-is-ending-active-development-on-new-world">end of active development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New World: Aeternum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the company, they reached a point where it was "no longer sustainable" to continue supporting the game with new content updates. At the time, the company reportedly shared insights about its goals and aspirations regarding its gaming business internally, as per a memo to staff </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">obtained by Variety</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the report, the company said the staff cuts indicated a larger strategy shift within the games division.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Largely, this reportedly translated to halting a "significant amount" of first-party AAA game development work, which led to "significant role reductions" in Amazon's studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing team. The company's plan, then, seems to be to continue to work with external studio partners. This includes Crystal Dynamics, which recently unveiled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which are expect to launch in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

It also outlines 14 reasons to empower women in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the reasons argues that "AI, virtual worlds, and the metaverse will define tomorrow," and as such, "women must help shape that future, not simply play within it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the vision behind this point, as well as what role will women play in influencing or shaping it, Isaaman said that her vision is one where these technologies are built to reflect the full diversity of the people who use them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That simply cannot happen if women are absent from the rooms where creative, technical, and ethical decisions are made," she continued in an email response. "Women must be involved not only as participants or consumers, but as designers, engineers, artists, leaders, and decision-makers who actively shape how these worlds function and who they serve."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-82-percent-of-us-based-game-developers-support-unionization" target="_self" data-discover="true">82 percent of US-based game developers support unionization</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, the CEO says that if women are excluded from the creation of AI systems, virtual economies, and immersive worlds, existing biases around representation, safety, access, and opportunity will be "hard-coded" into the future.

I fully understand why there is pushback, particularly at a time when the industry has seen devastating job losses. Ethical AI means recognizing that technology should augment human creativity, not replace it, devalue it, or exploit it. It means transparency about how AI tools are trained, how data is sourced, and how decisions are made. It means respecting intellectual property, creative labor, and the people whose work underpins these systems."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking on behalf of Women in Games as a whole, Isaaman said the organization believes AI must be developed and deployed responsibly, with "clear ethical frameworks and accountability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting creativity, accessibility, and innovation, but only if it is shaped by diverse voices and guided by human values.

            <p>
Nintendo's delightfully quirky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream has been given the full reveal treatment ahead of its Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release on 16th April. And amid the fresh deluge of information, Nintendo has confirmed same-sex relationships and non-binary options, fulfilling it's promise to be "more inclusive" following controversy around the game's 3DS predecessor.
</p>
<p>
When Tomodachi Life released for 3DS back in 2013, players disappointed at the absence of same-sex romances launched a social media campaign to encourage Nintendo to add them in a post-launch update. The company's initial response was dismissive, insisting Tomodachi Life was not a "real-life simulation" nor "trying to provide social commentary." Later, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-refuses-to-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life">took a more conciliatory tone</a>, apologising and saying that while it was unable to make such a "significant development change" to the 3DS version of Tomodachi Life, it pledged to "more inclusive" if another instalment ever came.

Over a decade later, Nintendo has made good on that promise. As revealed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">30-minute-long Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a>, players can choose from three gender identities when creating their Miis in the new game - male, female, or Non-binary - plus any combination of relationship preferences from the same list, effectively making it possible to create characters who're gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or heterosexual. And because this is Tomodachi Life, you also get to pick facial features, body shape, personality, even the silly computer-synthesised voices they'll use.
</p>
<p>
And once your Miis are ready to descend on their new island home, it largely looks like business as usual. Rather than controlling Miis directly, you'll encourage their growth by feeding them, giving them gifts, and creating new neighbours for them to interact with and befriend. And you can help introduce those friends to other friends, acting as a sort of omnipotent matchmaker to create a network of not always blissful social bonds.

<p>
Some encounters might happen while you're away from the game - perhaps your Mii will meet someone they take a fancy to - and you can keep abreast of events via the island's News Channel. Elsewhere, you can buy your Miis outfits from the clothing store, food from the supermarket, apartment decor from the Renovation Centre, and more exotic items - a lion?? - from the market stall. There's also a photo studio if you want to take some daft snaps.
</p><p>
Tomodachi Life residents might also make requests for island improvements from time to take, and you can decorate its outdoor spaces with everything from fences and picnic benches to new houses and additional terrain, all purchased from the Island Design Centre. And if you want to have a little more impact on your Miis, you can bestow them with quirks and traits, or drop them down at points of interest, so they can, say, jiggle in a sprinkler. It all looks as delightfully ridiculous as its predecessor, and that's before we get to the Studio Workshop where you can doodle your residents a 2D pet, or customise food, clothing, the TV channels they watch, and more. And yes there's romance, awkward love triangles, and marriage. Even shared housing for up to nine Miis.
</p>
<p>
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches for Switch and Switch 2 on 16th April, but there's currently no word on any Switch 2-specific enhancements.

            <p>Nintendo is introducing image sharing restrictions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream in order to create experiences that are "welcoming and enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">As seen on the Nintendo America website</a>, a statement laying out why these restrictions are in place have been included. They read as follows: "Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>"While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>"To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo's ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p>
<p>As for the extent of these restrictions, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> lays it out clearly: "The following features are unavailable: image transfer to smartphones, direct posting to social media, and automatic image uploads (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> only)." You can still share images via the Switch 2 Game Chat function.</p><p>The reaction to these restrictions are, as you can imagine, negative. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/">Take Dal from ResetEra</a>, who described the decision as "wacky". Racoon, on the same ResetEra post covering the decision, stated their belief that Nintendo "killed the game", adding: "social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it". Another, Mullet2000, summed up their thoughts as such: "Nintendo gonna Nintendo".</p>
<p>It's clear that Nintendo is implementing such measures in order to prevent folks from sharing images from the game that could be considered a bit <em>naughty. </em>But given the funny, easily meme-able moments present in Tomodachi Life, it does feel a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

            <p>
One of the nicer Industry Trends of the past few years has been the rise and rise and rise of climbing sims. It turns out climbing is a source of many emotions, from the melancholy wonder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> through the savage loneliness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> to the slapstick camaraderie of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> and the agony of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-a-game-about-eternal-punishment-and-frustration-is-tired-of-playtesting-it">various Sisyphus sims</a>. Also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. And I guess we should mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> here? See, it's an absolute avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is on the somber side. Created by The Game Bakers, it's about a woman with bandaged legs and a scuttling robo buddy. She's trying to reach the top of a mysterious mountain, with a selection of routes to choose from and a backpack inventory to manage. I get the sense that there's more up there than goats, snow and the tents of fellow climbers. We will find out shortly, for Cairn is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">on sale now on Steam</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Nic (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-the-demo-for-heavy-breathing-open-world-mountain-climber-cairn-now">impressed by the Cairn demo</a> back in December 2024, even though the leg animations gave him funny emotions. Fortunately, Nic's funny emotions make for entertaining reading.
</p>
<p>
"No graceful, contextual, restrictive animations for Cairn," he wrote. "No sirree! You'll also be carefully balancing your supplies, and using pitons as quick checkpoints as you make your ascent. You'll be thinking about things like posture, effort and balance while climbing. 'Each wall feels like a boss fight,' says Steam. Do...the mountains do the spinny FromSoft thing? I'd love that."
</p><p>
I do wonder how much of today's flourishing climbing genre is a delayed reaction against the success of Assassin's Creed - the game that 'fixed' videogame climbing back in the noughties by transforming it into a fluid spectacle of semi-automated ledge grabs and cornering. Remember videogame climbing before Assassin's Creed? It was all vikings doing pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake at murky vine textures. Still, there's only so many synchronisation towers you can auto-parkour before you want to get your fingertips dusty again.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is another change of tune for The Game Bakers, hitherto known for the nimble RPG snogging of Haven and the gimlet-eyed boss-rushing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a>. Also the *squints* cephalopoddy eco activism of Squids Odyssey. What will they bake for us next? A martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant? It's a martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant, isn't it. I am giving The Game Bakers 24 hours to deny this, before I write it up as a news story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Nintendo revealed a lot about the upcoming<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120"><em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em></a> The cute life-sim sequel is set to arrive in April on Switch and Switch 2. But when it arrives, be prepared to take photos of your screen using your phone if you want to share anything online, as Nintendo is locking down screenshot sharing in the game.</p> <p>On January 29, shortly after posting a new Nintendo Direct all about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, people noticed new information about the upcoming game on the company’s official support site. Specifically, as shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media, people discovered that the life-sim sequel, which lets you create characters and get them into wild situations involving other NPCs, will make it difficult to easily share screenshots of all the silliness online on both Switch and Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">In a post on its support page for the game,</a> Nintendo says <em>Tomodachi Life</em> offers plenty of “freedom” that can sometimes lead to “unpredictable moments.” And that’s a problem.</p> <p>“While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed,” said Nintendo. “Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image-sharing features.”</p>

 <h2>Which image-sharing features are blocked in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2> <p>While support page doesn’t go into specific detail about what these restrictions are, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">but if you visit the official Japanese website for the game</a>, you can find this notice:</p> <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">The console’s functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and </span><span dir="auto">automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available.</span></p></blockquote> <p>The notice does confirm that Switch 2 players will still be able to use Game Chat to share gameplay of<em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em> Still, it is annoying that Nintendo is placing such restrictions on the game, especially when you consider that anyone can just grab their phone and take a screenshot of the game and post it. Which people are going to do. So this won’t really stop people from sharing silly images of characters kissing or whatever Nintendo is afraid is going to happen in April.</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that Nintendo is, at least from what we can tell, not blocking screenshots entirely, just the ability to share them easily online with others.</p> <p>“We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting,” said Nintendo on its support page. “However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.”</p> <p>Some reacted to this news by suggesting that this is likely Nintendo trying to avoid another “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnote#Discontinuation">Swapnote incident</a>,” but that seems like a very different situation that involved people directly messaging young kids for nefarious reasons using Nintendo software. Taking a screenshot of something silly or weird in your game and then instantly sharing it online using a console’s built-in screenshot button and sharing options is such a great feature in most modern consoles. Nintendo trying to make that harder is odd and also ignores that, once again, everyone has phones and will share whatever they want online. I also can’t help but notice this is happening with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147">first Nintendo game to officially feature gay and non-binary Miis. Hmm…</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> arrives on Switch and Switch 2 on April 16. Don’t you dare share a screenshot of something weird happening, or a Nintendo lawyer will get you.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Nintendo found itself embroiled in a major controversy after Japanese fans alleged that Nintendo had initially developed, then removed, same-sex relationship options for in-game characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/05/nintendo-on-gay-marriage-and-tomodachi-life">Nintendo's Bill Trinen commented on the issue to IGN at the time</a>, and stated that while Nintendo had indeed updated the game, the update's intent had been to fix a data leak issue when importing characters from a previous game. Separate to this fact, Trinen said, some players had been using the same feature to import male Mii characters that could then be designated female, allowing for the appearance of two Mii characters of the same sex to marry and have a baby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of Tomodachi Life," <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/nintendo-virtual-equality-life-game-23620844?singlePage=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo then said in a statement</a>, which did little to stop the growing backlash. "The relationship options in the game represent a playful alternate world rather than a real-life simulation. We hope that all of our fans will see that Tomodachi Life was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game, and that we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As fan complaints grew, a fan petition for "<a href="https://miiquality.tumblr.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miiquality</a>" was launched, and the situation caught mainstream attention — including a high-profile skit by late night TV host John Oliver, who broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5w8OFrm6U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a skit featuring Mario and Link snogging</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo then issued a further statement with an apology for "disappointing many people" — and it was here that the company made a "pledge" to make a title that "better represents all players" should it release another Tomodachi title in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life," Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/nintendo-next-installment-of-tomodachi-life-will-be-more-inclusive">said at the time</a>. "Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game’s design, and such a significant development change can’t be accomplished with a post-ship patch. At Nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone. We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream allows players to create Mii versions of themselves, their friends, fictional characters and love interests and get them to all interact on a fantasy island. Clearly aware of some of the potential uses of this, Nintendo followed up today's Direct broadcast with a vague <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that said it would "place restrictions on certain image sharing features" for the game. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese support website</a> states that this relates to the ability to share images directly to a smartphone or social media, though sharing via Game Chat is still possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct">everything announced at the Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Crimson Desert just a handful of weeks from release, developer Pearl Abyss has released a 15-minute video showing everything from the story to the open world, alongside fresh gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This video shows main character Kliff and the continent of Pywel, which promises to be a seamless open world. Expect “sprawling wilderness, bustling cities, ancient ruins, and diverse regions, all set against a backdrop of escalating conflict and supernatural danger,” Pearl Abyss said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kliff is a warrior of the Greymanes, a faction from the northern region of Pailune. The story begins in the aftermath of a peace being shattered, and Kliff must reunite the Greymanes and reclaim their homeland. You end up discovering that the entire continent is involved.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The threat comes from the Abyss, a mysterious realm that’s sending fragments crashing into Pywel. Some want to exploit these fragments. You’re trying to restore balance to the Abyss and stop those who are exploiting it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Pearl Abyss called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ Will Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world won’t determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, in Crimson Desert you can fly around on a dragon, so despite the size of its world, you’ll be able to get about quickly. And don’t expect RPG elements in terms of decision-making and choice and consequence as it relates to your character, either. The sheer amount of things to do in the world will facilitate the role-playing part of Crimson Desert, which players will form through “head canon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You choose the type of character you want to play as in terms of your progression within the systems in the game,” Powers explained. “And then through head canon you’re having this very different experience than other players because of the scope and scale of the game. You’ll be distracted by something, you’ll go on this quest line, you’ll have an experience that’ll be radically different than someone else, even though they’re playing the same game and the same canonical storyline that you both are going through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-locks-in-march-release-date-as-dev-acknowledges-strong-anticipation"><u>Crimson Desert</u> has gone gold</a>, locking in its global release date of March 19, 2026. That’s across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Mac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-review</link>
            <guid>1419883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler did something that both scientists and other mountaineers considered impossible: they climbed Mount Everest without the use of supplemental oxygen. After reaching the summit, they split up for the descent, and it took Messner nearly two hours to reach base camp. When he did arrive, he was suffering from snowblindness. Later, a reporter asked him why he went up there knowing he could have so easily died. “I didn’t go up there to die,” Messner, who would return to complete the first solo ascent (also without supplemental oxygen) of Everest two years later, responded. “I went up there to live.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment that would resonate with Aava, the protagonist of Cairn. “All I ever wanted was to touch eternity for an instant,” she tells us at the outset, her eyes to the stars, “To reach one of those rare moments of bliss where everything seems in its place, and you feel you’re part of a whole.” But her mountain isn’t Everest; it’s Kami, a fictional peak no one has ever summited, and she is determined to be the first. Cairn is her story, and like both the mountain she is challenging and the climb itself, it is an incredible one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cairn Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cairn is a game about the climb, about choosing the right route up the mountain, finding the right handhold, taking a chance on the outcropping that seems slightly out of reach, pulling yourself up to a ledge just before your strength fails. Your path to Kami’s summit is up to you and you control each of Aava’s limbs independently (with some optional assistance on by default); each part of the climb is yours. The summit is the goal, but it is enough to make it to the next Bivouac, a tent in which you can sleep, to retape your fingers, cook food, and repair pitons damaged in the climb. There are meters in Cairn that track Aava’s temperature, hunger, hydration level, and overall health, and you’ll need to manage each if you want to survive. Cairn holds you accountable for your choices (if you don’t feed Aava, she will be weaker and climbing will be harder), but it’s rarely overly punishing, and managing your limited resources based on what Kami asks of you is both challenging and rewarding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What doesn’t have a meter is Aava’s stamina, how strong her grip is at the moment, or how well she is maintaining the position you’ve taken. For that, you’ll have to watch her: the way her arms and legs tremble on an unstable hold, the way she breathes, how she whimpers and winces as she’s about to lose her grip. These tells work great, but they can be subtle, especially at first, and you have to pay attention until you learn what to look for and how to position Aava properly as she moves up the mountain. Aava is incredibly strong, but she’s also human. She cannot hold onto smooth rock for long, nor scurry up a sheer cliff through sheer force of will. Shaking out a tired limb and refocusing while on a semi-stable hold will buy you more time, but you cannot scale all of Kami that way. </p><p>Cairn holds you accountable for your choices, but it’s rarely overly punishing.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salvation, and progress, are found in the small divots she can grab onto, tiny ledges where her feet can find purchase, a crack on the cliff face she can wedge her toes into. Sometimes, there will be nothing, and you will have to take a risk, to brace Aava’s leg against a flat surface in the hope that she can pull herself up before her strength fails or sidle across a small ledge, her hands pressed against smooth stone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the rock is suitable, she can drive a piton into Kami and build a belay, clipping herself to a loop of rope in order to rest. If she falls and you’ve been smart about using pitons, her Climbot helper will catch her, and you can climb the rope back to the belay, or use it to rappel down to an area you might not otherwise reach. But even here, it’s possible to make a mistake and realize you need a belay before Aava has time to drive the piton home, or twist it as it’s going in, ensuring Climbot can only recover part of it rather than the whole thing the next time you’re on solid ground. If the stone is too dense, you’ll have to make the climb unaided. These are Cairn’s most memorable moments. You are going to fall. The only question is whether or not it will kill you, and how much time you’ll lose if the mountain claims you.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pull the camera out for a bird’s eye view of your location at any time (and see the route you’ve taken to get there, including failed past attempts), which is crucial for planning the next leg of your ascent. There are no wrong answers. Sometimes, the route is clear, but slower; other times, it’s faster, but more difficult, and requires more risk. Often, it’s somewhere in between, and you’ll have to choose where and how the route challenges you rather than if it will. And then there are the times where you’ll think you’ve found a good route only to reach a section without a clear answer, then check the map again and see that there was another, easier path available. Sometimes, you can tough it out with smart choices, chalk (which increases your grip strength), and a few well-placed pitons. Other times, it’s best to adjust your path. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Climbing Kami is exhilarating, and I often found myself gazing up at the path before me wondering how I would manage it, only to look down and realize I had a short time later. There is joy in planning out a route, in securing a piton at the last second before Aava falls, in finding the right handhold or wedging Aava’s feet into a crevice that unlocks a path that seemed impassible, in chalking up and daring to persist a difficult section in the rain instead of waiting it out on a belay, in seeing the path you chart in your head becoming the route you’ve taken, in finally pulling yourself onto a ledge after a particularly difficult climb when the night is falling and your visibility is failing and Aava is dehydrated and hungry and tired, in beating the mountain through sheer, dogged determination. The act of climbing doesn’t change much throughout Cairn’s runtime (my playthrough took me 19 hours, but I was very thorough), and occasionally Ava’s limbs may spider in strange directions or she may fall through the mountain, but I was so invested it hardly mattered.</p><p>I will never summit Kami; my victory is inevitable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I play, Kami exists as something without end, taller than I could possibly imagine, something I will never complete, and the mountain I am scaling, all at once. It is a remarkable balance, and something Cairn never loses. I will never summit Kami; my victory is inevitable. Each time I make it to a Bivouac (which doubles as a save point), I feel like I’ve done the impossible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But inside, there is always more to do. I need to tape Aava’s hands, scarred and covered in blood from the climb. I need Climbot to craft new pitons from the scraps I saved. I need to cook a meal, rehydrate. Aava brings supplies to the mountain, but her backpack can only hold so much. Each time I eat a chocolate bar or drink some milk or tape Aava’s hands, I know I am using up a resource I might not get back. Each time I sleep, I know she will wake up hungry. Kami forces me to make compromises. Climbing at sunset is dangerous because I can barely see; climbing at night is nearly impossible, something I only do if I have no other choice. Sometimes, I rest not because Aava physically needs to, but because there is no way to keep going until sunrise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is not all hardship. When I need something, Kami provides. In caves, on ledges, I find dandelions, perfect for tea. Raspberries. Fresh, clear water. Fish. I am always <em>teetering </em>on collapse, never there. There is always just enough, if I’m smart. Climbot recycles used plastic and bottles and makes chalk. Each part of my journey feeds the other.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I learn the mountain’s story. I find the remains of a cable car and its station, of smashed-open vending machines, flyers and advertisements. Tourists walked here, once. Companies offered anyone the chance to see the mountain until it wasn’t profitable anymore, until it failed, until the mountain pushed back. I find the remains of the troglodytes, a civilization built on Kami, beautiful cities carved into the mountain, great statues. I explore. I learn of their resentment of climbers like Aava, the way civilization came for them, encroached on them, eventually forced them down. The remains of what they built are marked by pitons and covered in climbing rope. “My mountain belongs to everyone,” Aava tells a goat that attacks her. But in climbing it, I realize it isn’t true. By being here, I am profaning something sacred. I am walking through the graveyard of a culture people like Aava helped kill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I am reminded of the cost of what I am attempting. Sometimes, the hints are subtle. Bear-proof boxes full of supplies. Abandoned backpacks. Other times, they are less so. Dead bodies. “Sometimes you come for the mountain,” Aava says gently, kneeling over someone who shared a dream with her. ‘Sometimes the mountain comes for you.” Abandoned campsites. I learn of a group tracking bears on the mountain, and I wonder what happened to them, and about what I might run into as I ascend. I find the corpse of one-half of a climbing team, two orphans who promised to conquer Kami together, and a letter saying the other has gone on in search of a mystical flower with healing properties, hoping to save his partner. I find markings and letters from a couple who scaled Kami together, getting a little higher each time they attempted it. A broken Climbot still receiving messages because maybe that means the climber it belonged to still is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These stories, and others, recur and build on themselves as I climb, and I find them moving. I explore, go out of my way, to see them. Cairn is not just about Aava; it is about Kami, and everyone who has attempted to climb it. There seem to be two outcomes: either they turn back, or they die. Kami remains unconquered. The mountain always wins.</p><p>Stories recur and build on themselves as I climb, and I find them moving.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I ascend, I also learn about Aava, about the kind of person she is, about who someone driven to do something like this must be. Climbot relays messages she receives as she climbs. From her agent, Chris, who goes from begging her to send him photos to appease their sponsors to just begging her to let him know she’s all right. From her friends, who sing her happy birthday. From her partner, Noami, who does not understand why she is doing this, who reminds her of the cost of what she’s attempting. Aava mostly ignores them. Sometimes they make her smile, make her sad. Sometimes, she is angry with Climbot for playing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She meets other people on the mountain. A climber named Marco, who is a fan, grew up reading about her exploits. She is terse with him, occasionally unkind, though she does not mean to be. The quest for the summit may drive her, but she is running away from the world on the ground as much as she is climbing toward Kami’s peak. For everyone else, there is a life at the bottom of the mountain. All they have to do is give up and come down. For Avaa, the climb is all there is.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's favorite games where you mostly walk around</h3><p>Does what it says on the tin</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/edgarallanbro/lists/wills-favorite-games-where-you-mostly-walk-around" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Cairn never gives us the whole story; everything comes in pieces, in hints, in what’s left unsaid, and in small comments, like the one she makes to Marco when he mentions her father, himself a climber, who put Aava on her first climbing wall when she was three years old. “Great guy,” Marco says, impressed. “So they tell me,” she responds. Like the mountain itself, Aava is complicated, complex, imperfect. And like the mountain, she is incredible. How I felt about her changed as I climbed, but I always understood her. As long as she faced Kami, so would I.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of Cairn, Aava must make a choice about who she is, what she is willing to sacrifice, and how the experience of climbing Kami has changed her. It is a remarkable fusion of gameplay and storytelling, of everything you have seen and done on the mountain. Each choice leads to a different ending. Neither is wrong. I have seen both paths, and in either case, the last couple hours of Cairn are something I will remember for a very long time. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Cairn would mean nothing without the journey, without the climb, without the moments where I faced everything Kami had to throw at me, from sheer cliffs to bad weather to climbing at night. Each time I was close to the top, I discovered the peak was farther off. And each time, I would tape up Aava’s hands, cook whatever I had, and keep going. I knew what she could handle, what she needed, how strong her grip would be, where I could take my chances. My reward was always something wondrous, and by the end I was as attuned to Aava’s body as my own. But what I’ll remember is the story of the mountain and the people on it. I’ll remember the climb. I’ll remember Aava. Kami asks Aava two questions: “Who are you? Why are you here?” Her answers are simple: “I’m a climber. I came here to live.” And through her, so could I.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For those who have been hearing all about this little show called Fallout, but don't have an Amazon Prime account and therefore haven't been able to keep up with the various wasteland chaos, I have some good news for you:</p>
<p>Fallout season one is streaming for a limited time on YouTube.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The first two episodes of season one - The End and The Target - are available now via Amazon's Prime YouTube channel, with the remaining episodes then releasing steadily over the coming days.</p>
<p>Here is the premier schedule for Fallout season one on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1E1 - 28th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E2 - 28th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E3 - 29th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E4 - 29th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E5 - 30th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E6 - 30th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E7 - 31st January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E8 - 31st January, 6pm PT</li>
</ul>
<p>For those in the UK, 5pm PT is 1am the following day, and so of course 6pm PT is 2am.</p>
<p>This means, if this is your thing, you could probably squeeze episodes three and four into your morning routine before heading off to work tomorrow (though I am not sure Fallout gore and breakfast are the best combination, but who am I to say what works for you).</p>
<p>As per Prime's YouTube description, these episodes will expire on 11th February, at 11:59 pm PT. Will you be giving season one a watch?</p>

		<p>Nintendo had another Direct stream for one of their early 2026 games, putting the weird and wonderful world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream</a>, which is now set to launch for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Nintendo-Switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 16th April 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct – 29/01/2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNtYngxAs1k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The weird, waking dream cousin to the comparatively sensible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream gives you an island for you to populate with Mii characters and then act as their caretaker. There’s an element of The Sims where they will be able to wander around and find their own things to do and have their own desires, but it’s much less hands on.</p>
<p>It will start with creating your main character and other island residents, with the Mii character creator having been expanded for this game with new options such as face paint, eye-lights and more. You can also set each character’s dating preferences, and then determine some of their base personality. The intention is to create family and friends, but you can also fiddle with these options enough to create a teddy bear, for example.</p>
<p>With people on your island, they’ll sort of do their own thing, but you can prod and push them in a direction. Get two people to meet by picking one up and moving them nearby, and they’ll strike up conversation and probably friendship. &nbsp;They’ll also have desires, so you can hand them food when they’re hungry, give them new outfits and more. Over time, you can mould the characters by giving them quirks, like&nbsp;funny walks, floating, signature greetings, different eating styles, catchphrases.</p>

<p>But then they can have suggestions for people who should meet and give an introduction, or they might develop a crush, fall in love after a typically silly meet cute, and then get rejected. Or confess their love in a situation that you give helpful suggestions for – obviously do it when you’re on a romantic ferris wheel, right? – and suddenly rivals show up for the character to choose between! Drama!</p>
<p>If you get characters to live together, you’ll get to check in on their lives and see how they’re hanging out, their personalities clashing and vibing. Maybe they fight over the TV remote, help each other cooking, or have house meetings.</p>
<p>The island will come to have a bunch of shops for helping you customise, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supermarket</strong> – With daily rotating food, like escargot</li>
<li><strong>Clothes Shop</strong> – Featuring day-to-day clothing and sillier fancy dress</li>
<li><strong>News Station</strong> – The home of MiiNews with bizarre Mii character insert stories</li>
<li><strong>Renovation Centre</strong> – &nbsp;Choose room interiors such as modern minimalist, football stadium, or a fantasy forest</li>
<li><strong>Market Stall</strong> – Get great deals on items, or grab a mystery bag…</li>
<li><strong>Photo Studio</strong> – Pick your background and scene, choose the Miis to fill the spots and snap photos!</li>
<li><strong>Island Design Centre</strong> – Buy benches, flower pots, and much more to decorate your island. You can also expand the island and use this as a way to create a big metropolis, multiple joined land patches, and even giant portraits.</li>
<li><strong>Studio Workshop</strong> – Create pixel art patterns that can become item inserts for characters, from drawing a pet to latte art, TV backgrounds, clothes patterns, ground tiles, house exteriors and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade, and on everything we saw in this Direct, it could be pretty darned great!</p>

Along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">a release date</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo has confirm that players will be able to create non-binary Miis in the new game <em>and</em> that they'll be able to select dating preferences for their characters.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>, and in a game where customisation and creation is off-the-charts, more gender and relationship options should be a given. It <em>should've</em> been a given in 2013, but Nintendo is making up for it this time around.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rgspzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now, when creating your Mii, you'll be able to select from three genders: Male, Female, and Non-binary. And you can also select your Mii's dating preferences, again between the three gender options. You can select one, more than one, or none of them. Essentially, you can date whoever you want — or no one at all — catering to gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, aromantic, asexual, and all sorts of LGBTQIA+ relationships.</p>

<p>This is a <em>huge</em> win for many fans of Tomodachi Life on the 3DS, which drew criticism back when it released in Japan in 2013. Initially, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">a bug appeared to allow same-sex relationships in-game</a>, which Nintendo later patched out. Nintendo followed up the patch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/04/nintendo_provides_some_context_to_2013s_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_controversy">with some clarifications</a>, but fans were understandably still unhappy that the option to date whoever they wanted wasn't available.</p>
<p>This prompted the 'Miiquality' social media campaign ahead of the game's Western release, with Nintendo of America addressing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">the controversy shortly after</a>. Then, two days later, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/nintendo_apologises_for_disappointing_many_people_over_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_issue">the company issued an apology</a>, stating "if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p>
<p>And, given today's Nintendo Direct, it seems like the developers have stuck to their promise, which is fantastic to see. Now we can all spend time with Hugh Morris however we want, romantically or not.</p>

			<p>Although one, if not the <strong>most iconic sequence</strong> in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has already been recreated in<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, there are still a lot of beautiful moments left to recreate in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em>. One of these moments, which takes place near the end of the original, was one the series director was looking forward to recreating, and he believes the team did <strong>full justice to it.</strong></p>



<p>As reported in a recent <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">livestream</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vinesauce</strong></a> had the chance to participate in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a casual gathering </strong>which took place after a promotional event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em></strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> </strong>with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in New York City earlier this month. Unsurprisingly, the<strong> third part of the remake trilogy</strong> was briefly mentioned when Hamaguchi-san revealed which <strong>part of the story yet to be remade he was more looking forward to.</strong></p>



<p>Through an interpreter, Hamaguchi-san said that the moment he was looking forward to recreating the most was <em>"Cloud finding himself with the help of Tifa,</em>" which is one of the <strong>most intense and emotional parts of the Final Fantasy VII story</strong>. While he did not discuss much about how the scene was recreated in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</em>, Hamaguchi-san stated that <em>"they nailed it,"</em> a strong statement that is sure to make every fan of the game quite excited about what is in store for the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Besides seeing the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">emotional impact</strong> this particular moment will have with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current-generation graphics</strong> and with the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> superb voice acting</strong> that Cody Christian and Britt Bratton already delivered for Cloud and Tifa in the first two entries in the series, it will be very interesting to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much the scene will have been changed</strong>, with Tifa's brief first venture in the Lifestream in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which doesn't happen in the original, and Cloud's already being partially aware of his past and the truth behind the Nibelheim incident. No matter what, I know I am really looking forward to it.</p>



<p>With the name for<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</em> finally <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">decided</strong>, it's not surprising that the development team is starting to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">talk more about the conclusion of the trilogy</strong>.

            <title><![CDATA[“Gamers Are Not Actually Opposed to AI, But Rather People Exploitation and Slop”, Says Dev Behind AI-Powered Game Bobium Brawlers]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/</link>
            <guid>1419847</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Game developer <strong>Studio Atelico</strong> is announcing its AI-powered debut game, <strong>Bobium Brawlers</strong>, today. It's a turn-based card and dice creature battler game currently targeting mobile platforms (iOS to start, where it's set to launch later this year) with a specific twist: players can create the creatures that will be in their deck simply by describing them to the so-called Studio Atelico AI Engine. </p>



<p>Crucially, the AI engine will run on-device, ensuring privacy, low latency, and no additional costs. Because of this, Bobium Brawlers will only run on models equipped with relatively recent versions of the <strong>Neural Engine</strong>, probably from <strong>iPhone 13</strong> onward. Of course, the developers also created many decks and cards to train the engine to follow those examples when creating new cards.</p>



<p>In a remote presentation attended by Wccftech, Art Director <strong>Mollie Boorman</strong> explained that <strong>Studio Atelico employs a team of human artists who have created extensive training assets</strong>. These images were paired with descriptions to train the model. She clarified that <strong>this game simply could not have been made without AI</strong>, as it allows players to create unique artwork in minutes. However, they are not using AI for everything.</p>



<p>Moreover, the studio paid artists to develop the visual style and to create the bulk of the non-creature art featured in Bobium Brawlers, and <strong>continues to pay them for the styles they created, including royalties for creatures generated in-game using their training assets</strong>. Their ethical approach was described as distinctly pro-artist, pro-player, and pro-human, <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/game-ai-art-without-losing-your-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in a blog post on their website a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>After the presentation, given the strong anti-AI stance of many hardcore gamers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as seen recently with the debacle surrounding <strong>Larian</strong> and their upcoming <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), it's no wonder that the very first question in the roundtable interview addressed the elephant in the room: is the studio ready to face backlash?</p>



<p>Studio Atelico CEO and co-founder <strong>Piero Molino</strong> explained that he sympathizes with the profound reasons behind this growing sentiment among gamers, but also clarified that he doesn't believe gamers are actually anti-AI; rather, they are opposed to "slop" and the exploitation of humans that is sometimes associated with it.</p>



<p><em>I understand that stance for two reasons. One, because of how most tech companies are adopting this technology without providing for the people who made it possible, which are, in the case of image generators, the artists whose images the generators have been trained on. It makes total sense why there is this kind of pushback; I totally understand that. We are approaching it from a different point of view: paying artists and giving them royalties on what is being generated. </em></p>



<p><em>We do not want to exploit anyone; we want to use that technology to create new mechanics that were not possible before. <strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and "slop." These are both things that we are trying very strongly to avoid</strong>. We are supporting the people who make it possible to create these models and we are not creating slop. We are trying to have a specific art style that is tailored to our specific game, thanks to the work our artists are doing. We hope to disentangle the general sentiment towards AI and show what is possible when you use it in a very positive way.</em></p>

<p>Later in the interview, Molino added that in the very first version of Bobium Brawlers, <strong>some parts of the AI Engine will run in the cloud, but only a very small amount</strong>, and the studio plans to move those on-device as well in the future. Because they are just small parts, the cost for Studio Atelico is very low: less than one cent per creature creation overall. Molino reckons bringing the cost of AI engines in games to zero or close to it is crucial for the technology to actually spread in more titles.</p>



<p>When it comes to the game mechanics, the duels will be quick 1v1 battles that blend card mechanics with dice-rolling action. Players will be able to use clever combos and tactical improvisation, rather than grinding or chasing the meta, to win matches.</p>



<p>The bigger question, though, is whether you agree with the studio's approach and the CEO's view on why gamers are so vehemently anti-AI. Let us know in the poll and comments below!</p>
