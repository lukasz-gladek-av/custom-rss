<p>A new platform has been added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-doom-robot-lawnmower-husqvarna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of things</a> that can run Doom, which is not as surprising as the others. A developer has posted the original Doom running on Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and you can check out the clip below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Original Doom running on Fortnite is a unique and intriguing feat. The most fascinating aspect is the addition of build mechanics to the player character, offering a fresh perspective on the game. The ability to ‘crank 90s’ in Doom is a feature that was never imagined. The creator, Jackson Clayton, shared that while he can’t officially publish this, the process of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was a valuable learning experience about Material and Post Processing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177?utm_campaign=Kotaku&amp;utm_content=1720637674&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Clayton detailed how he got Doom running on Fortnite. He stated that the first thing he did was export the E1M1 files as a 3D model from Ultimate Doom Builder and ported that into Fortnite’s UEFN. Then Clayton removed “Unreal’s fancy effects” to make the game feel like it was running in Fortnite. Additionally, Clayton used Unreal’s material system to provide a choppy spinning effect for the Doom Marine and the Post Process material to add pixelation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clayton’s journey of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was not without its challenges. He found the UEFN to be advanced, requiring him to ‘get creative’ with the process. His experience in creating other Doom-like games in the past was a significant advantage, making this process easier.</p>

<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-trailer/">officially revealed during this year’s Xbox Showcase</a>; check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the game will be playable on the PlayStation 5</a>. What did you think about Doom running on Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a>'s release in 2022, millions of gamers have embraced the rich lore of the fantasy world created by Hidetaka Miyazaki with George R. R. Martin. Now, a new high-end book called Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring brings all of the mythology of the Lands Between into a beautifully-crafted tome. But it's also extremely expensive.</p><p>Irish publisher Tune &amp; Fairweather is releasing Grace Given, which was written by Geoff "SmoughTown" Truscott. The book is over 500 pages long, and it is "encased in a lavish, gold-foiled, full-color hardback." YouTube personality Quelaag wrote the introduction, and the book will feature 25 bespoke chapter-header illustrations by Chris Lewis Lew. Shimhaq is contributing over 15 full-color Elden Ring illustrations, while the artist known as MenasLG is providing over 100 spot illustrations. To cap things off, artist Elliot Wells has created five full-page gold illuminated numeral illustrations.</p><p>The Collector's Edition will be $277 or €250. But the Limited Edition will jump to $775 or €700. That version includes gold page-edge gilding on all three edges, and a signed and numbered art print by Shimhaq. It also comes with free shipping.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331437" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331437"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331490,1300-4331491,1300-4331492" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg"></figure><p>For anyone with money to burn, there's also the Benefactor Edition, which has a price tag of $1,107 or €1,000. That includes everything from the Limited Edition, but adds a custom name credit that will be included at the back of the book and in any future editions of Grace Given.</p><p>Although Grace Given is not officially endorsed by From Software, Tune &amp; Fairweather has previously published books about Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and Demon's Souls. Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2025. Preorders are open now <a href="https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/collections/grace-given-the-mythology-of-elden-ring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Tune &amp; Fairweather's official site</a>. However, the Limited and Benefactor editions are only available for order through August 10. Additionally, everyone who preorders by that date will also get the ebook version of Grace Given as soon as the book is completed.</p><p>For From Software fans who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a book, there are several notable new books to buy from Amazon. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDark-Souls-Trilogy-Compendium-Anniversary%2Fdp%2F3869931280%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-primeday-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-elden-ring-book-is-going-to-cost-you-a-fortune%2F1100-6524860%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Dark Souls Trilogy Compendium Anniversary Edition</a> was released earlier this year.

		<p>It’s Amazon’s annual Prime Day promotion in just a few days, the time where we all all buy loads of junk we really did not need. Talking of loads of junk, Prime Gaming are joining in the fun and are giving away Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League! Arf!</p>
<p>The game, along with Chivalry 2 and Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration, will be free on PC to Prime Gaming members from July 16th at 12am PT / 3am ET. You will have just 48 hours to claim the titles but then they are yours to keep forever.</p>


<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was the highly anticipated game from Batman Arkham creators Rocksteady but unfortunately it was, well, not very good.</p>
<p>“Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience,”<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"> wrote Gareth in our 6/10 review.</a> “The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | Official Gameplay Launch Trailer - “Do the Impossible”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmWFiQj70gM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jim took a look at Chivalry 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/15/chivalry-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc/"> and gave it a solid 8/10. </a>“The melee combat may not be as technical or strategic as some hardcore fans might like, yet it’s hard to deny the appeal of Chivalry 2’s dismembering deathmatches,” he said. “Those first few sieges are truly enthralling as watch waves of red and blue troops smash against each other. Over time it may lose its edge though Chivalry 2 is still one of the most fun and unique multiplayer games out there.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Chivalry 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6AlUgZtb7g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration is the daddy here having been released way back in 2016, but we also gave that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">8/10 in our review</a>. “Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action-packed tour-de-force that, while derivative at times, is a fantastic romp from beginning to end. This sequel learns some of the lessons of its predecessor by making the game more like a recognisable Tomb Raider game, while at the same time implementing some new features and impressive visual design. While not quite the globetrotting adventure some were hoping for, Rise of the Tomb Raider is well worth playing.”</p>

            <p>
An unofficial Elden Ring lore book is on the way courtesy of a YouTuber expert.
</p>
<p>
Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring will be a 500+ page book from Geoff "SmoughTown" Truscott, and will include beautiful artwork from fans of the game.
</p>
<p>
While not an official product - the description notes it's not endorsed by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco - it's certainly a lavishly created book. But, at £215.00, you'd expect it to be.

<p>
That price is for the basic Collector's Edition, with gold page-edge gilding and white leather binding ensuring a premium feel. Additionally there's a Limited Edition version at £602.00, which includes a collectible art print, and an £860.00 Benefactor Edition to have your name credited in the back of the book.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly pricey, then. As for the content, it will include details on gods and nations, history and ideology, and more alongside the artwork.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SmoughTown/videos">SmoughTown</a> has over 230k subscribers on YouTube and has produced plenty of lore videos across a whole range of games, with a particular focus on Elden Ring and Dark Souls.
</p>
<p>
Yet considering much of Elden Ring's lore is somewhat up for interpretation - unless, of course, George R. R. Martin unearths whatever manuscripts he wrote for the game - this unofficial book is likely only for diehard fans, especially at that price.

Still, there are plenty of adaptations of the game being created. Earlier this year an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-elden-ring-webcomic-out-next-month">official manga webcomic was released</a>, which follows a particular Tarnished on their journey to become Elden Lord.

</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-receives-teaser-trailer">fan-made anime adaptation received a first teaser trailer</a> ahead of a release in the autumn.

</p>
<p>
And could we see an official TV or film adaptation in future? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">George R. R. Martin certainly seemed to hint it could happen</a>.

Martin has revealed a set of new covers for A Game of Thrones and the entire A Song of Ice and Fire book series.</p><p>Revealed on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/07/10/a-bold-new-look-for-the-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-boxed-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, the stunning new covers "capture the vastness of Westeros and the dangerous journey readers will encounter." The five books are available in a boxed set and will be available online and in stores in October 2024, though no price was revealed.</p><p>"There is a raw and gritty quality to linocut and woodcut art," the post continued. "A certain starkness that seemed to fit the stories, and a long history to the art form that felt right for this world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Song of Ice and Fire 2024 Box Set</h3></div></output><p>"This cover design process paired linocut artist Mark Seekins and designer Tim Green, with art direction from David G. Stevenson. They worked together to develop sketches and carve the designs into blocks of linoleum, where the raised areas were inked and pressed onto paper.

New indie action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> Tako No Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets  - customary disclaimer: "JRPG" is a contentious term which some feel fetishises Japan culture, while others define it more neutrally as a specific style of role-playing game - is set in a world shadowed by a long-ago war between Human and Octopus. This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

I wouldn't want it to get around these parts that I used to play handheld console games, in case my official RPS explosive collar detonates, but I <em>loved</em> Golden Sun. It's a beautiful lightshow, with its plush 2D sprites and spinning, zooming battle camera, and an entertaining though rarely challenging fantasy adventure. The first customer service call I ever made to Gamestation as a wee nipper was to ask if they had Golden Sun in stock, the second after reading about the game in a magazine. "We don't have a release date yet," the cruel voice on the other end of the line informed me, smashing my hopes and dreams. Tako No Himitsu doesn't have a release date yet either, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357380/Tako_no_Himitsu_Ocean_of_Secrets/?curator_clanid=40737195">it does have a demo on Steam</a>, and I'll be giving that a go over lunch, because the trailer looks tremendous.

<p>
Some plot from that Steam page: "Wild animals are disappearing, the mysterious Temple of the Order is on the rise, and shadow voids are suddenly populating the land. Gather six heroes and their Octopus companions and work together to save a world consumed by the secrets of its past." This sounds a touch more involved than Golden Sun. It also has top-down real-time combat that puts me in mind of Alundra or Zelda, rather than Golden Sun's turn-based spell-o-swording. You can switch characters on the fly, and enlist the skills of various magic octopi - "the heroes of the past" - to lacerate foes with elemental fizzibangs, and solve puzzles. Sounds like there's a touch of monster-catching to the proceedings, then.
</p>
<p>
The demo offers around an hour of mollusc-abetted Game Boy Advancing and look, you can even play it on a mocked-up in-game "Himitsu" handheld if you like to layer up your nostalgia like peanut butter and jelly. It's almost enough to overpower my habitual reservations about writing up Kickstarter games - this one feels like a safer bet than most. Tako No Himitsu is a "spiritual successor" to developer Deneos's 8-bit platforming homage Save Me Mr Tako (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472540/Save_me_Mr_Tako_Definitive_Edition/">Steam page hyah</a>), which was well-received back in 2021, and which appears to chronicle the aforesaid Human-Octopus War. I'm curious to know whether Deneos's evident vast and unholy love of tentacles came before their evident vast and unholy love of retro consoles. I'm thankful that they've found a way to combine the two.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/modded-nintendo-switch-baldurs-gate-3-run-crysis/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A modded Nintendo Switch with 8GB of RAM is capable of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/">running select PC games surprisingly well</a>, but it fails to do the same with more recent and demanding games, as highlighted by a new video shared today.</p>
<p>The new test, which was conducted like the previous ones by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> on YouTube, puts a modded console with 8 GB of RAM, CPU running at 2.6 GHz, and GPU at 1.26 GHz to the test by running multiple PC games using Box64 + Wine on an L4T Ubuntu 18.04 with custom kernel OS. While Devil May Cry 5 runs surprisingly well, although never hitting 60 FPS consistently, the modded console fares much worse running more demanding games like Baldur's Gate 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Fallout 4, and Assassin's Creed Unity. In the case of the Larian Studios' successful role-playing game, the modded Nintendo Switch console can't even hit 20 FPS, although the fact that it is even running is impressive enough. The latest main entry in the Tomb Raider series fares even worse, hitting single-digit framerates during the benchmark. Surprisingly, the modded Nintendo Switch can run the original version of Crysis rather well, although performance is unstable and not exactly playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="14 PC Games Tested on Nintendo Switch (8GB RAM) - Box64 + Wine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwLaAkcp7Vg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch was undoubtedly an underpowered system even at launch, some developers managed to release some extremely good ports of demanding games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-switch-preview/">The Witcher 3 port developed by Saber Interactive</a>. Hopefully, developers won't struggle porting their multiplatform titles to the console's successor, although there's the chance that things will become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ports-issues-next-gen/">more complicated</a> once the next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft launch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scrap-cdl-adderall-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toronto-ultra%E2%80%99s-scrap-tells-the-truth-about-using-adderall-in-call-of-duty.924564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/scrap-cdl-adderall-call-of-duty/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst is one of the most controversial young players in the Call of Duty League. He has been amazing viewers worldwide since his debut season last year, constantly performing at the highest level and enabling Toronto Ultra to score some major upsets. However, his loudmouth attitude and failure to deliver when it matters most have led many to criticise him time and again.</p>



<p>Recently, Scrap got down to brass tacks on a stream and spoke the truth about abusing Adderall while playing Call of Duty. It’s no big secret that it’s something of a pandemic in the esports space, with many competitors leaning on the prescription drug to focus their attention and lock in on a game – but it has so many adverse effects.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-yourself-onto-that">‘Don’t Get Yourself Onto That’</h2>



<p>In 2023, Scrap talked smack against the New York Subliners then promptly lost against the team in a record-breaking Grand Final at COD Champs that saw Toronto Ultra fail to win a single map. It effectively happened again at Major IV this season, with Scrap running his mouth and being booted from the tournament by the Subliners with a scoreline of 0 – 3.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Scrap was clipped talking about Adderall, admitting that he took the drug when he played at Challengers tournaments. He quickly warned anyone off the medication, stressing that it’s ‘so bad for you’. He then stressed that he’s clean now and only drinks water during events – he doesn’t even consume caffeine. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ll be honest, I took it in Challengers, bro. I took it in Challengers for tournaments, like LANs. I don’t take it anymore, I drink straight water. I took it for tournaments only, but that shit is so bad for you, bro. If anyone in here… I do not recommend ever trying to take it to play a video game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For years, Adderall abuse has been a big issue in the Call of Duty space, and a few months back, scenes emerged that led many to believe that Indervir ‘iLLeY’ Dhaliwal was hooked on the pills. While talking on stage after Major I, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjLdxlPXzlY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iLLeY appeared skittish</a> and unpredictable, failing to deliver his words and visibly tweaking. He said that he was on caffeine, but many doubted that claim.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip of Scrap talking about Adderall:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scrap had to explain that Adderall was never the reason for his attitude towards other players – he’s just been like that for years, he insisted. It’s widely assumed that testing is relatively loose in the Call of Duty League, as many players have had quite public battles with Adderall addiction over the years.</p>

		<p>It’s an understatement to say that the last few years have been difficult for video game creators both big and small. Cancelled projects and huge publishers have led to swathes of layoffs, but it goes deeper than that, with smaller studios struggling to find the funding to make ends meet.</p>
<p>That was the situation that Dutch studio KeokeN Interactive faced earlier this year, the creators of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deliver-us-the-moon">Deliver Us The Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deliver-us-mars">Deliver Us Mars</a> unable to either find support for a third Deliver Us game or for other projects and forced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/01/deliver-us-the-moon-studio-keoken-lays-off-entire-team-will-rebuild-brick-by-brick-to-deliver-us-home/">almost completely wind down the studio</a>. But game development is often a passion, and that holds true for KeokeN co-founder Koen and Paul Deetman. They’re looking to rebuild their studio “brick by brick”, with a foundational stone being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home">a Kickstarter for Deliver Us Home</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deliver Us Home - Kickstarter Teaser [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uwzy_hQS-o8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the crowdfunding drive in its final hours –&nbsp;it concludes at 9PM BST today, and has crossed its minimum funding goal –&nbsp;we’ve been able to go hands on with a prototype demo that is included with some backer rewards. It immediately features familiar ideas and gameplay mechanics from Deliver Us Mars in particular.</p>
<p>The ending of Deliver Us Mars suggested that the surviving characters and all of the knowledge and technology they had managed to salvage would be heading back home, to Earth. Naturally the assumption for a sequel titled Deliver Us Home is that it would, somehow, tie into that desperate struggle to salvage something from our homeworld.</p>

<p>What KeokeN actually has in mind is something a little bit different. Much like in the blockbuster film Interstellar –&nbsp;how is that a decade old now? – Earth is a lost cause and mankind needs to find their way to other planets in order to survive as a species. Skipping ahead to the 23rd century and humanity has long since departed this planet and our solar system, journeying into the unknown to prospective new homes.</p>

<p>A descendent of the evacuees from Earth sent to survey planets, you crash land on Carlo 394e and are faced with a stark reality. Yes, it appears that this planet is rather Earth-like, but you’re not the first human to have set foot on this world. There’s isolated little facilities and buildings of different kinds, dotted across the landscape, a few message logs that start to peel back just a little of what the rest of this planet holds and what the previous expedition faced, and more.</p>
<p>There’s also little previews of the fundamental gameplay mechanics, many of which are returning from Deliver Us Mars. Played from the third person, there’s some environmental traversal in the vein of Uncharted or Tomb Raider, aided by a jet pack, some early puzzles to find and repair an ASE companion bot, and a vehicle you can hop in to get around.</p>

<p>A new element is that there’s much more scavenging the environment, scrounging up the left behind resources needed to craft core items: a new radio antenna, thrusters to repair the ASE, and the like. The Deetman brothers have also explained that they want to take more of a ‘wide linear’ approach, opening up the world a bit more for freeform exploration and getting a mix between the lonely adventuring of Deliver Us The Moon, and the more cinematic group storytelling of Deliver Us Mars.</p>
<p>This prototype amounts to a tech demo, but it also shows the direction that KeokeN will take now that they’ve successfully funded the Deliver Us Home. You still have a little time to dive in and add your support to the game’s development, but now the long road of game development and for KeokeN’s revival begins. Through the next year, they’ll be working to create a vertical slice of the game –&nbsp;another backer reward –&nbsp;with an aim to release the full game in the second half of 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-brixelizer-gi-is-a-compute-based-dynamic-global-illumination-solution-available-now-in-sdk-1-1/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new compute-based dynamic global illumination solution, <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-brixelizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI</a>, has been released alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-v1-1-fsr-3-1-support-enhanced-upscaling-quality-decoupled-frame-generation-dlss-xess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDK 1.1</a> (which also introduced AMD FSR 3.1).</p>
<p>AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI is based on the Brixelizer library, which generates sparse distance fields for triangle geometry in real time to effectively trace rays in a given scene. Brixelizer works with static and dynamic geometry, providing a shader API to trace rays against the distance field. It outputs cascades of sparse distance fields around a given position, with each cascade divided into 64x64x64 voxels. Once a voxel intersects any geometry, a local distance field is generated within the voxel. These local distance fields are called Bricks, hence the name of the technique.</p>
<p>Its main goal is to provide a faster alternative to traditional DXR-based ray traced shadows and/or ambient occlusion. Depending on the size of the scene, it can offer a sizable performance boost, as shown in the comparison slide below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To further improve performance, developers can increase voxel size to an extent. That will result in a coarser sparse distance field, which can be offset with increased ray bias.</p>
<p>AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI takes a game's G-Buffer and the sparse distance fields (SDFs) plus Bricks generated by Brixelizer to create Diffuse and Specular GI outputs. The sparse distance fields lack any material information, so there's an internal radiance cache based on the lighting output of previous frames. According to AMD, including the composited output from the previous frame effectively provides free multi-bounce global illumination. Then, screen probes are spawned on the depth buffer's visible surfaces. Rays are shot with Brixelizer, while the radiance cache is sampled for shading.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI is a simplified version of the GI-1.0 <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-capsaicin-graphics-framework-out-now-includes-gi-1-0-real-time-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> in May 2023 alongside the Capsaicin Graphics Framework. Perhaps AMD noticed game developers haven't been picking it up and decided to make it more accessible. We'll keep an eye on whether any studios select this technique over traditional hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware will continue working on the Armored Core series in the future, judging from a new job ad that was discovered online this week.</p>
<p>As reported by cindiestarlight on the <a href="https://forums.tech4gamers.com/threads/exclusive-fromsoftware-hiring-for-armored-core-7.206/">Tech4Gamers forums</a>, the Japanese studio is looking to hire a Character Modeler whose responsibilities will include modeling and texturing characters or robots. While this is in no way an indication that a new entry in the series is already in the works, a new Armored Core definitely seems to be in the cards.</p>
<p>FromSoftware planning to release another entry in the Armored Core series comes as no surprise, given the success of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon and Hidetaka Miyazaki stating multiple times in the past few months how he wanted to make another game in the series. With the sixth entry in the series being among some of the best, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">review</a>, it will really be interesting to see how the studio will evolve the formula.</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware has created its pinnacle mech-fighting opus with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. The faster pace of combat and higher difficulty may deter newcomers from strapping in for the first time, but there’s truly something special at play here. If the pace of Elden Ring leaves you wanting more or you simply want to blow up anything that moves, Armored Core VI’s got a job for you.</em></p>
<p>The latest game released by FromSoftware is the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about it by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most iconic series in gaming history. It was debuted by Sega in 1991 in an effort to rival Nintendo’s Mario, and today, it’s one of the most popular multimedia franchises in the world. However, the head of the studio at Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, isn’t fully satisfied with what they’ve created thus far and was recently discussing the concept of a Sonic RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-project">The Last Project</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, Takashi Iizuka, who has worked on the Sonic series since 1994, addressed the topic of a Sonic the Hedgehog game with a twist – an RPG-focused twist.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I really like role-playing games. The RPG game format is a lot of fun, and I’ve even thought to myself, ‘You know, for the past 30 years, we haven’t done a Sonic RPG.’ And I’m questioning myself. ‘Why haven’t we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the video that covered Iizuka’s comments:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The 54-year-old developer would love to produce a Sonic-themed RPG before he retires. He explained that it’s ‘just a dream right now’, but it sounds like it’s his ultimate deliverable before he retires from Sega, where he has worked for 30 years. In 2022, the team released Sonic Frontiers, an open-world platformer that saw players ‘battle hordes of powerful enemies’ as Sonic and his fellow anthropomorphised buddies.</p>

		<p>The boys are back in town and this time they’ve got an added dimension. Billy, Lee and the gang from the classic Double Dragon arcade series are being reimaged by Arc System Works and Yukes in to a 3d brawler, check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Double Dragon Revive - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihrv32XmEdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is described as “more than a simple button-masher” so it sounds like you are going to have to learn some combos, “delve into the strategy by learning enemy patterns and finding the most effective attack timings” add Arc System Works,.</p>
<p>The game keeps the side scrolling element of the original, “This work faithfully reproduces the real thrill of the belt scrolling while adjusting the control feel and difficulty level to suit modern times,” reads the Famitsu article via Google Translate.</p>
<p>The last game in the main series was the fairly average Double Dragon IV, but there was a spin off, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/04/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-is-coming-this-summer/">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon,</a> released last year that went for a cutesy pixel based aesthetic.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive -is due to launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

Let Me Solo Her has once again changed their name as part of an effort to help other players defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss.
</p>
<p>
Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">legendary player changed their name to Let Me Solo Him</a> to help with a certain boss encountered around halfway through the DLC.

</p>
<p>
Now they've turned their attention to the notoriously tricky final boss that's had players stumped. <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.

</figure>
<p>

In a new video with the description "Finally, the trilogy", Let Me Solo Her becomes Let Me Solo Them for the battle against final boss Radahn, Consort of Miquella (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-is-finally-complete-let-me-solo-her-finishes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-as-let-me-solo-them-perfectly-destroying-the-dlcs-final-boss-with-its-biggest-weakness/">GamesRadar</a>).
</p>
<p>
The jarhead legend is summoned by a player called I'm Sorry, before single-handedly beating the pair of bosses with perfect precision.
</p>
<p>
So how is it done? Multiple Antspur Rapiers are used, in part due to its buildup of Scarlet Rot. After all, that's what Radahn and the region of Caelid are inflicted with in the base game. This rapier also has bleed damage and is used against Promised Consort Radahn.
</p>
<p>
Two further Antspur Rapiers are used in the second phase against Radahn and Miquella. The first inflicts ice damage to slow the boss down; the second inflicts poison for a gradual build up of damage. It's the latter that eventually kills the boss, without the need for a final stab.
</p>
<p>
All the while, Let Me Solo Them dodges every single attack to not lose a single point of health. When some of us really struggled against the boss, it's actually filthy to watch this in action.

<p>
But why are so many people struggling against this boss? Over on reddit, players have been complaining about hitboxes. 
</p>
<p>
A hitbox is where two characters make contact and damage is taken. However, during this final boss, it appears that damage is sometimes taken before a hit makes contact and the player has a chance to block or dodge.
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dygok7/spoiler_dont_trust_the_boss_animation/">one player takes damage before a hit makes contact</a>; another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dzhrcx/why_can_the_endboss_hit_you_midroll_tho/">player gets struck down mid-roll</a> when it should have been dodged. This, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">Kotaku</a> points out, was a major criticism of bosses in Dark Souls 2, and it appears to have infected the final boss of Shadow of the Erdtree too. 
</p>
<p>
If you're really struggling, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-new-thrusting-shields-make-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty-trivial-players-say">try the shield method</a> - this proved successful for me. Otherwise, give Let Me Solo Them a call.

Royal Mail has revealed a set of stamps featuring familiar faces from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, including Baldur's Gate 3 favourites such as the Mindflayer and Owlbear, which have apparently been personally approved by the King. 
</p>
<p>
Other designs include the Gelatinous Cube, Mimic, Displacer Beast and Vecna, alongside a party of player characters including a tiefling rogue, human bard, halfling cleric, elf fighter, dwarf paladin and dragonborn wizard. 
</p>
<p>
A "presentation pack" with the full set of stamp designs costs £24.40, and ships on 25th July. If you're feeling flush, <a href="https://shop.royalmail.com/special-stamp-issues/dungeons-and-dragons">Royal Mail has a whole shop full of other D&amp;D stamp paraphenalia</a> you can purchase, including three enlarged prints for £150 each.

"Building on Hasbro's existing work with Royal Mail, we're honoured to release this beautiful collection of stamps, officially approved by HM King Charles III, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the World's Greatest Roleplaying Game," Wizards of the Coast global play lead Dan Rawson said. 
</p>
<p>
"With stunning art from long-time Dungeons &amp; Dragons artist Wayne Reynolds showcasing our adventuring heroes and fearsome creatures, we're sure these items will be treasured by D&amp;D fans and stamp collectors alike."
</p>
<p>
The project is timed to release alongside D&amp;D's 50th anniversary, and comes just as Baldur's Gate 3 begins to wrap up its updates - with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">forthcoming patch set to add console modding that will act as a handover point to fans</a> from developer Larian.

            <p>
Nintendo fans keen to find out more details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">yesterday's unexplained horror game teaser Emio</a> believe The Medium and Layers of Fear developer Bloober is behind the project. 
</p>
<p>
There are clues that Bloober is involved in a recently-published interview with company boss Piotr Babieno, fans say.  In it, Babieno discusses a mysterious title "for Nintendo platforms" codenamed "Project M".
</p>
<p>
"Project M, although its budget is significantly smaller than the games we are working on at Bloober Team, is extremely important due to our long-term plans," Babieno told Polish site <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a">Strefa Inwestorow</a>.

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Who is Emio?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"In addition, we are working on it in cooperation with the world's best game creators for Nintendo platforms, so we cannot afford to create just a decent game."
</p>
<p>
Is Project M the mysterious Emio? A developer such as Bloober being on board would seem more likely than this being an internal Nintendo project. And what about that reference to Nintendo platforms, plural? Is this a cross-gen project for Switch and Switch 2? Babieno goes on to note that the project will be fully unveiled later this year.
</p>
<p>
For now, fans have been left to wait for more clues. Eurogamer asked Nintendo for more details on the project yesterday, but is yet to hear back.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prime-day-gaming-will-gift-suicide-squad-chivalry-2-and-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Amazon announced that PC gamers will be able to grab three high-profile games on Prime Day: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Chivalry 2, and Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration. These titles will be available for a limited time only: beginning on July 16 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET, Prime users will have 48 hours to claim them. All of them will provide access to the games via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is, of course, by far the most recent game of the trio. Released in February after an extremely long development cycle, the game largely failed to capture interest. Parent company Warner Bros. famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> it contributed to a much lower ($200 million) EBITDA compared to last year, which saw the incredibly successful launch of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game of 2023. That said, the developers are still improving the game and adding new content. Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was supposed to launch today</a>, but it has since been delayed to July 25. It will add Mrs. Freeze as a playable character, new maps, boss fights, and gear.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/chivalry-2-nearly-all-is-fair-in-love-and-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chivalry 2</a>, launched by Torn Banner Studios over three years ago. The Canadian studio is still supporting the game, as shown by May's free Regicide update that added an epic new map culminating in a clash of kings, a versatile new polearm, a new campaign pass, new cosmetic customization options, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Lastly, 2016's <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review-raiding-the-croft-manor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration</a> can be grabbed as well. It's the second installment in the latest Tomb Raider trilogy, and it even features a coop Endurance mode.</p>
<p>These are actually bonus Prime Day games, by the way. The main list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deceive Inc.</li>
<li>Tearstone: Thieves of the Heart</li>
<li>The Invisible Hand</li>
<li>Forager</li>
<li>Card Shark</li>
<li>Heaven Dust 2</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/soulstice-chimera-may-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulstice</a></li>
<li>Wall World</li>
<li>Hitman Absolution</li>
<li>Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</li>
<li>Call of Juarez</li>
<li>STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic II — The Sith Lords</li>
<li>Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a></li>
<li>Samurai Bringer</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> all of these today.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-downgrade-fallout-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-will-downgrade-your-version-of-fallout-4-before-it-runs.924495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-downgrade-fallout-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Fallout: London is due to be released any day now, with GOG – the platform that’s going to host the super-sized mod – running through QA checks as we speak. Months ago, when Bethesda Game Studios revealed the release date for the Fallout 4 next-gen update, the team working on Fallout: London announced an indefinite postponement of the highly anticipated mod, citing the unpredictability of the upgrade and the inevitable failure of mods as the reason for the delay.</p>



<p>Now, a monumental effort has made Fallout: London ready for release, but there’s a huge catch – to play it, you’ll need to downgrade your version of Fallout 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bye-bye-upgrade">Bye, Bye Upgrade</h2>



<p>Fallout 4’s next-gen update wasn’t everything that fans were hoping for. It’s fair to say it was a sizeable disappointment, and it didn’t change the face of the almost ten-year-old game like many expected it would. It threw mods into disarray, with creators scrambling to update their files to align with the upgraded version of Fallout 4 – and it also caused Fallout: London to be postponed by several weeks.</p>



<p>It has been explained by the Fallout: London team that when you install the mod, you’ll also be installing a ‘downgrader’, which will take your version of Fallout 4 and roll it back to a stable version <strong>before </strong>the next-gen update dropped. That means that you’ll lose some of the key benefits offered by the upgrade in exchange for being able to play Fallout: London. </p>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per the team</a>, this is necessary because the upgraded version of Fallout 4 simply ‘isn’t stable’, and if the team has to wait around for it to be ‘fixed’ by Bethesda Game Studios, Fallout: London might never be released. </p>



<p>It’s an awkward blow, but it does mean that Fallout: London can ship as intended through GOG, rather than being cancelled entirely and having years of development efforts written off.</p>

            <p>An Unreal Engine developer has got classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> running in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, in a manner of speaking broad enough to justify a series of headlines about it, including my own. Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ultimate_Doom_Builder">Ultimate Doom Builder</a>, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">gut bacteria</a>,<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-weirdest-way-to-play-doom-using-rat-neurons-grown-in-a-jar"> jar-grown rat neurons</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-weird-device-to-run-doom-your-lawnmower">lawnmowers</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/now-you-can-play-doom-over-teletext">teletext</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-you-brush-your-teeth-tonight-remember-to-install-doom-on-your-electric-toothbrush">electric toothbrushes</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-is-out-now-for-windows-notepad-sort-of">Windows notepad (sort of)</a>, and<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yup-a-pregnancy-test-is-the-weirdest-device-ive-seen-running-doom"> a pregnancy test</a>.</p>

</p></div>

<p>The practical upshot of this is that Clayton is able to use Fornite’s building system in the level. Speaking to <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">Kotaku</a>, Clayton says that after porting the level over “it was mostly removing Unreal’s fancy effects to make everything unlit and unfiltered. I used Unreal’s material system to give the Doom Marine [sprite its] choppy spinning effect, and a PostProcess material to pixellate the screen and show the gun.”</p>
<p>The Unreal Editor For Fortnite (UEFF) is ““too high-level” for a one-to-one code translation, says Clayton, so he had to “get creative” to spin up a convincing facade of the FPS grandpappy inside the plucky Battle Royale also-ran. Clayton is also an indie dev, having released games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2293880/CASTILLO_The_Nine_Circles/">Castillo: The Nine Circles on Steam</a>. Castillo is “Doom-inspired”, says Clayton, so the experience he'd built up helped with this worthy endevaour.</p>
<p>The main motivation behind all this? Clayton simply enjoys a little trolling. “I wanted to put together a video to trick my friends, so I ported the map and created the post-process materials, and they really liked it.”</p>
<p>Wait, wait, I missed one! Doom has also run on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">jailbroken tractor</a>! There’s plenty more on <a href="https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/">this Tumblr page</a> if you fancy a bit of rabbit holing. My personal wishlist for the future of bizarre Doom ports include a digital casio watch, a vape, and also a furby somehow, hellish creatures that they are. Although my actual wishlist is just to get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> running on my normal PC as soon as humanly possible.</p>

			<p>NBA 2K25 is official. This year's edition of 2K's basketball game will launch worldwide on September 6, featuring Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum as the cover athlete for the Standard Edition. He is joined by Las Vegas Aces' A’ja Wilson on the cover of NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition, while Wilson will be the only cover athlete of the WNBA Edition, a GameStop exclusive available in the US and Canada. Finally, NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition will feature 2024 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee Vince Carter on the cover.</p>
<p>The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch, where it is $10 cheaper. The All-Star Edition is priced at $99.99 on all platforms and it includes 100,000 VC and MyTEAM content such as 10 MyTEAM Player Cards (3 guaranteed to be 89 OVR), 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boosts, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card; as well as MyCAREER content, including 150x Skill Boosts (25 Games), 75x Gatorade Boosts (25 Games), Jayson Tatum Cover Jersey, Jayson Tatum Electric Skateboard Skin, and a 2K25 Cover Stars Design T-Shirt.</p>
<p>Finally, the limited availability Hall of Fame Edition is priced at $149.99 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, which comes with everything mentioned above from the All-Star Edition plus a MyCAREER Vince Carter Cover Jersey, a Season 1 Pro Pass with 4 upfront Pro Pass rewards and a 12-Month NBA League Pass Subscription (which, mind you, won't work in Japan, China, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Libya, Kosovo, North Korea, Russia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, or Syria).</p>
<p>The developers at Visual Concepts have promised new MyTEAM modes and, for those on 'Next-Gen' platforms, an added sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, along with the chance to cement their G.O.A.T. status in The W.</p>
<p>However, arguably the biggest change for PC players is that they'll finally be able to enjoy the 'Next-Gen' version with NBA 2K25, which comes with enhanced authenticity and realism powered by ProPLAY technology. The Steam page already lists the full system specs - an SSD will be required.</p>

<p>Shift Up, the developer behind this year’s PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade, has skyrocketed in South Korea following a monumental IPO that netted $320 million (435 billion won). Per the reports, it’s the single biggest IPO in South Korea by a gaming firm since 2021, when Krafton Inc. secured the record by netting a whopping $3.8 billion.</p>



<p>It’s the second-largest IPO in South Korea in 2024, only being edged out by a Hyundai subsidiary.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money-bigger-plans">Big Money, Bigger Plans</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, it was noted that Shift Up plans to use the funds secured by the IPO (initial public offering)  to ‘diversify its game portfolios’. Until now, the Seoul-based firm has developed and released two key titles: Stellar Blade (2024) and Nikke (2022).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Stellar Blade was released on the PlayStation 5, scoring strong results despite an air of controversy surrounding the title. On social media, most of the discourse surrounding Stellar Blade was focused on the comely main character, Eve, and the slew of revealing outfits she could wear in the post-apocalyptic title.</p>



<p>Analysts have written that Shift Up’s stock value could rise now that the IPO has been such a success. The company has a ‘high success ratio’ and plenty of opportunities for diversification going forward. One analyst wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The investment case rests on a stellar game development track record, several growth drivers, high profitability, and cash generation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade has mostly come and gone by now, but fans are still clamouring for an expansion or a PC port. It was revealed a while ago that Shift Up is already looking at a potential follow-up title, but that’s a story for another day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/blacksad-under-the-skin-review-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I love a good private detective story. While they vary in quality, you can at least expect twists and turns, with a typically gruff investigator at the centre doling out noir-styled musings. Blacksad: Under The Skin was first released in 2019, but has just released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing players to revisit a case of murder, corruption, and extortion with some current gen graphical updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blacksad: Under the Skin - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wEKUPYvsKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blacksad: Under The Skin is an interactive adventure title, with the gameplay primarily based on talking to characters, gathering clues from scenes, and then deducing what you have collected to come up with theories to work out the case. The case itself all starts with the apparent suicide of boxing gym owner Joe Dunn, who is found hanging above his boxing ring by the cleaning lady. Meanwhile, our near broke private eye John Blacksad is just finishing a case about a cheating husband, who is none too pleased with his life being investigated.</p>


<p>The opening of the game will introduce you to the basics of character interaction and quick time events (QTEs). The latter is primarily used for the times Blacksad gets into fights, though there are a couple of other situations they pop up in. They are mostly fine, but there were moments where the timing seemed to be off with a slight delay between input and action, which could cause fails to execute a move.</p>
<p>For the majority of the game, you will be walking around different locations as Blacksad, after he gets hired by Dunn’s daughter to get to the bottom of her father’s death and the disappearance of the gym’s star boxer. Unsurprisingly, the first port of call is the gym, followed by locations such as a diner, apartments, and offices. In all of these areas, points of interest will pop up for Blacksad to interact with, amongst the huge number of sports collector cards that almost litter every scene.</p>


<p>Points of interest will include everything from quotes painted on a wall, to the large cast of characters that cross your path. There is frustration when it comes to movement and interacting with the environment, since Blacksad walks quite slowly. A jog/sprint button would have been a welcome addition. Points of interest require Blacksad to stand in specific positions, and navigating him to some of those points is cumbersome.</p>
<p>The visuals, including the character designs and models are for the most part very good, though outside of Blacksad, many of the personalities seem to lack real substance, playing more into caricatures. Some are a bit on the nose, yet they all fit into this 1950s anthropomorphic criminal world. The voice acting can vary, with some lines delivered in ways that jar within the context of a scene. In addition, there were times where the mouth movement was slightly out of sync with the audio. Overall though, the voice acting is decently delivered.</p>
<p>The environments meanwhile offer plenty of detail all the way from the minor scuffs on the wall, to reflective surfaces and some truly excellent lighting. There are however noticeable issues that haven’t been ironed out by this refresh, like blurred lettering on some signs, and clothing bunching and failing to react as it should.</p>

<p>Blacksad is fundamentally predicatable, but you’ll enjoy the journey nonetheless. What is not always fun is the deduction. Blacksad gathers clues to piece theories together, theories you likely would have pieced together a while before. In the deduction screen you have to match Blacksad’s thoughts to come up with deductions. What should be obvious connections don’t always work, so at times you’re following some almost unrelated though processes to get a deduction. Outside of deductions, if you make the wrong choices or miss a QTE Blacksad can be killed, but this has very little bearing since the scene loads straight back into the choice or action again, allowing you to undo that mistake.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-fans-can-now-play-the-cancelled-%E2%80%98van-buren%E2%80%99-game.924459/</guid>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered about the ‘original’ Fallout 3 title that was cancelled in 2003 – Van Buren – you’re not alone. This mystical title was supposed to be a follow-up to 1998’s Fallout 2, developed by Black Isle and acting as a sizeable expansion to the already substantial post-apocalyptic universe created by Interplay. </p>



<p>Well, wonder no more. Recently, a new super-sized mod for Fallout 2 was released by a team called PJ Hexer and Co, and it’s dubbed ‘Fallout Yesterday – Van Buren’. Through this mod, you can explore a fan-made recreation of Van Buren inside Fallout 2’s engine, with the game-sized mod having been painstakingly built based on everything we know about the cancelled Fallout game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-back-in-time">Go Back in Time</h2>



<p>Van Buren is one of the most talked about topics amongst veterans of the Fallout franchise. Fans coming into the series for the first time following the launch of the Fallout television series will never have heard of it, but it’s an important topic in the overall history of Fallout. In 2003, Van Buren – which was the codename for Fallout 3 – was cancelled, and it wouldn’t be until 2008 that the Fallout 3 we know and love was released by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>In the new mod that was released just days ago, and updated even more recently, players can explore what Van Buren might have been. Per the description on the mod, it features:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Multiple races, hundreds of new Traits and Perks, items, weapons, gameplay additions, dozens of new locations, 7 different vehicles, and new companions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout2/mods/91?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a hefty mod that’s around 5GB in size</a> with all the files being downloaded, but it’s well worth utilising Nexus Mods to get your hands on the best and most faithful recreation of Van Buren I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately, the original game will never see the light of day, but mods like this are keeping the lights on for Fallout historians worldwide, and that’s a beautiful thing.</p>
