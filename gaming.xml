            <p>Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund isn't worried about Arc Raiders releasing between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to">In an interview with Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>, the former EA studio lead talked about the studio, The Finals' journey to profitability, and Embarks' approach to live service development. On the specific subject of Arc Raiders release date, Soderlund stated:</p>
<p>"People may look at that and say, 'what the hell are they doing?' We have spent a lot of time looking at this from multiple angles and you know, for right or wrong, we believe that the game can launch there. This is the start of a long journey. It needs to start somewhere."</p>

<p>Despite Arc Raiders' seemingly uncomfortable launch date, the game has garnered a substantial amount of positive attention from players. When asked how, Soderlund responded with the following: "I think it comes down to not being complacent enough to believe that we can build something without making a meaningful impact or innovation. We have to bring something so that people pay attention. And if we've done a good enough job, maybe they'll stick around. But in order for them to break away from what they're already playing, there needs to be an attraction."</p><p>This is just a small portion of an almost 50-minute interview, which is well worth listening to in full. But Arc Raiders' situation does harken back to an all-too familiar situation for Soderlund and many Embark Studios' initial staff. Soderlund was the executive vice president of EA when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> launched, itself squeezed between a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Arc Raiders can sustain its momentum while caught in a similar predicament remains to be seen, though perhaps an extra decade of experience, an intense feeling of virality around Arc Raiders, and a vastly different industry landscape can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders is set to release tomorrow on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With news of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m3zm9jnl1o">massive layoffs coming to parts of Amazon’s corporate business</a>, the company has also turned its baleful gaze towards its gaming division and announced that their MMORPG New World will no longer receive content updates after the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven content has run its course.</p>
<p>This isn’t an end of service notice just yet, with the companion FAQ stating that servers will be live through 2026 at least, and they will provide at least six months’ notice of a server shutdown. Because of that, and with the Nighthaven seasonal content still planned to roll out gradually, the New World is remaining on sale and part of the PS Plus library, and microtransaction currency will still be available, though the appeal of the game and player base will no doubt dwindle through the coming months.</p>


<p>We also await news of Amazon Game Studios’ future with dread….</p>
<p>New World arrived with a huge bang in 2021, as Amazon brought its fantasy colonialist MMORPG to PC, racing to a huge peak of over 900,000 concurrent players that pushed the servers beyond the limit. After such a strong start, the playerbase (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>) dwindled through early 2022, but enjoyed a new peak of over 130,000 for the first yearly expansion. Perhaps a lot of expectation was put internally on the potential of the console port, which arrived with a major game overhaul last September in the form of New World: Aeternum, but on PC at least, the game has spent much of this year with daily peak player counts below 10,000, jumping up to 50,000 with the new Nighthaven update. That’s roughly comparable with a Fallout 76 or Elder Scrolls: Online, so could easily have been sustainable depending on development expenditure, but it’s half of where Destiny 2 commonly is right now, and that game is widely regarded as being in serious trouble.</p>
<p>The announcement reads:</p>

<p><em>As New World recognizes its fourth anniversary since launching on PC, we reflect on an incredible journey shaped by our dedicated player community. Your feedback and passion have been instrumental in evolving Aeternum into the world it is today, and our team is deeply grateful for this shared adventure. After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.</em></p>
<p><em>The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players.</em></p>
<p><em>In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum. Additionally, New World: Aeternum will still be downloadable for PlayStation Plus members (Extra and Premium).</em></p>
<p><em>Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey. We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special.</em></p>

			<p>John Romero might not be a name that youngsters recognize, but he was a legend of the early days of the first-person shooter genre, co-founding id Software and making videogames like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Hexen, and Quake, to name a few. </p>



<p>Nowadays, he makes smaller titles at Romero Games. The studio's most recent title was the Mafia-themed turn-based strategy game Empire of Sin, launched in late 2020 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/empire-of-sin-disorganized-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a mixed reception</a>. More recently, John Romero and his fellow developers signed a deal with Microsoft for their next project, but that deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went awry along with the latest Xbox layoffs</a>. The development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not shut down</a>, though, and Romero himself <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/john-romero-we-were-about-midway-through-our-game-1624993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has provided an update to Gamereactor</a> in an interview conducted at San Diego Comic Con Malaga. The game was halfway done, and many publishers are interested in helping with funding.</p>



<p><em>We're still figuring out what we're going to do with our big game. We own the intellectual property, we own the code, we own everything about the game. So, we have a lot of companies that are interested and still working with us on it, because when you develop a game for years and you put in, say, $50 million into a game, if you move and start working with somebody else, they get $50 million for free. So lots of people want to continue working on something, and even if that doesn't happen, you have $50 million worth of assets that you can use to make another thing. So no matter what, you are shortcutting the end of your game, right? To be able to get your game done faster, you already have a lot there already. We were about midway through our game.</em></p>



<p>Here's hoping that John Romero can find a solid publisher to bring the game through the finish line. We've already had more than enough game cancellations for this year, at least as far as I'm concerned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-we%E2%80%99re-now-the-largest-gaming-publisher-and-want-to-be-everywhere-the-real-competitor-is-tiktok.1337845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d8dA8GtE8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a live interview on TBPN</a> (Technology Business Programming Network) discussing various topics, including the company's updated multiplatform strategy on the gaming front.</p>



<p>Nadella pointed out that following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the largest gaming publisher in terms of revenue. The goal, then, is to be everywhere the consumer is, just like with Office. The Microsoft CEO then interestingly pointed to TikTok, or, to be more accurate, short-form video as a whole, as the true competitor of gaming.</p>



<p><em>Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business. And of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it. So to us, the way we're thinking about gaming is - first of all, now we're the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore, we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office.</em> <em>We're going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the PC, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>



<p><em>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward. So, I'm very looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly, the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well, because after all, the gaming's competition is not other gaming. Gaming's competition is short form video.</em></p>



<p>The Microsoft CEO clearly refers to the fact that every entertainment bit competes for the user's attention on any given day. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the New York Times</a>, following the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> and all future Halo titles would also launch on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Game Studios president Matt Booty made a similar comment, mentioning that everything from movies to TikTok constitutes competition nowadays.</p>



<p>During the TBPN interview, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella made another comment that might irk some people in the industry. On one hand, he stressed the need to continuously innovate to keep consumers' attention; on the other, he said that to do that, it is necessary to have 'good margins'.</p>



<p><em>If we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model, right? Best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund.</em></p>



<p>However, it is a tone-deaf statement following the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> that have hit Microsoft as a whole and the gaming divisions specifically in the past couple of years. Meanwhile, Nadella's own pay grew 22% year-over-year and reached the astounding sum of $96.5 million.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-connection-lost-steam-error-fix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-%E2%80%98connection-lost%E2%80%99-steam-error-explained.1337842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the deployment of the 1.1.1.0 update in Battlefield 6, Steam players worldwide have been met with a ‘Connection Lost’ error message when trying to access the Battlefield 6 campaign. This has been addressed by Electronic Arts as a known issue, but the team has yet to provide further updates regarding a resolution.</p>



<p>In this snapshot guide, we’ll help you understand the Steam ‘Connection Lost’ error in Battlefield 6, and provide information on how to get around it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-connection-lost-error">How to Fix Connection Lost Error</h2>



<p>If you’re booting Battlefield 6 through Steam and getting a ‘Connection Lost’ error in the campaign, there are a few things you can try to workaround the issue.</p>



<p>First, <strong>restart the game and quit the Steam launcher entirely, rebooting both after a few seconds</strong>. This will clear your sessions and refresh your login to both Steam and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Second, you can try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong>, refreshing your networking connection and resetting your WAN IP to hopefully fix routing issues, if that’s the problem.</p>



<p>If you can, <strong>switch from Wi-Fi to Ethernet </strong>to eliminate any residual issues with internet speed or capabilities. As a rule, gaming is best done with an Ethernet connection, as this offers uninterrupted, unbroken links.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>disable any VPN or proxy services </strong>that you might be using, as this can cause a direct conflict with EA’s systems and servers.</p>



<p>If you want to go <strong>even deeper </strong>with network-related fixes, you can try to change your DNS settings, flush your DNS cache, or even fully reinstall Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re aware some Steam players are encountering a “Connection Lost” message when launching the Battlefield 6 campaign. Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1983405982584844292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-steam-specific-fixes">Steam-Specific Fixes</h3>



<p>Some users have had luck fixing the Connection Lost Battlefield 6 error by enabling Steam’s Beta Client.</p>



<p>Here’s how you do this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open Steam</li>



<li>Click Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</li>



<li>Under ‘Client Beta Participation’, select ‘Steam Beta Update’</li>



<li>Then restart Steam</li>
</ul>



<p>In the meantime, it’s worth staying connected to the <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA server status page</a> and following the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Comms page</a> on social media to stay up to date with all the issues ongoing in Battlefield 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield REDSEC Review—A Solid BR But Very Warzone Coded]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-review%E2%80%94a-solid-br-but-very-warzone-coded.1337836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s REDSEC platform is now open for all to access, and as a free-to-play Battle Royale game, it’s doing exactly what you’d expect. There’s a large, open map, a couple of battle passes to choose from, a bunch of missions to resolve in-game, and an ever-shrinking circle of death that eventually strangles the entire lobby.</p>



<p>It’s Warzone-coded, and in many ways, that makes sense, because the leadership team piecing REDSEC together has that in their blood. Ultimately, REDSEC doesn’t offer anything in the way of any huge innovations on the Battle Royale genre, but it <strong>is </strong>a decent entry into the space that should at least be tried.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-redsec-any-good">Is Battlefield REDSEC Any Good?</h2>



<p>As a Battle Royale title, Battlefield REDSEC is everything you could hope for. Players parachute into a map from helicopters, picking their landing zone from a series of POIs, looting crates, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-missions/">kick-starting missions</a>, and fighting other players. As the game clock ticks over, the playable zone shrinks, surrounded by a ring of deadly fire.</p>



<p>It’s the same concept as Firestorm, the Battlefield 5 BR mode introduced almost seven years ago, which more or less fell flat on its face.</p>



<p>REDSEC offers all the trappings of Battlefield 6. The weapons, characters, equipment, vehicles, and movement mechanics are all pulled from the central experience, which is itself a fantastic offering. On the surface, REDSEC feels great to play; the movement is smooth and fluid, and the core elements of a Battlefield game, such as intense destruction, are&nbsp;present.</p>



<p>As you explore Fort Lyndon, the map in REDSEC, you’ll find ‘killstreaks’, challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/">to unlock tanks</a> and other powerful vehicles, custom weapon drops, and kits that you can use to upgrade weapons on the fly.</p>



<p>This is where the innovations that <strong>do exist </strong>start to leech into the game, and it’s also where we see some cross-collaborative innovations coming over from games like Apex Legends, also published by Electronic Arts.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Even the Double XP token system is pulled clean from Call of Duty</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s good, but I couldn’t help but feel I was playing Warzone at times, which isn’t what you want from <strong>a direct competitor</strong>. Everything from the double XP token structure to the battle pass mechanics, and from the nature of side missions to the loadout features, REDSEC simply smacks of Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>







<h2 id="h-redsec-proves-battle-royale-is-still-going-strong">REDSEC Proves Battle Royale is Still Going Strong</h2>



<p>The Battle Royale genre is an ebb-and-flow kind of thing that never seems consistent. It has been populated over the years with multiple games, and once upon a time, developers in fringe titles threw their hat in the ring to see what they could do.</p>



<p>With that, I mean that even games like Forza Horizon and Fallout 76 once had Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>The hype surrounding REDSEC was palpable, and going into the game at launch, players were met with sizeable queues. There was a spike in traffic on streaming and content platforms, and player counts had a nice injection of energy, with Battlefield and Call of Duty fans alike eager to explore this free-to-play BR platform.</p>



<p>Even after more than a decade, the concept of the Battle Royale remains a winning one, and REDSEC takes the ball and runs with it, producing something laden with potential that might just be stable enough to challenge the likes of Warzone. </p>



<p>There’s a learning curve for sure, especially concerning the destruction capabilities of the game and some of the movement and weapon handling mechanics, but I feel that this is as accessible a Battle Royale as you could hope for.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Battlefield REDSEC map is deeply Californian</figcaption></figure>







<p>The map is great, too. It’s the kind of environment I love, fusing urban biomes with natural regions and a touch of mountainous, desert areas. It’s diverse, large enough to accommodate the player count without feeling enormous, and has plenty of nooks to explore.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Full Battlefield 6 Review</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-but-it-s-not-perfect">But It’s Not Perfect</h2>



<p>REDSEC has had issues at launch. When I played, I experienced more than my fair share of bugs and glitches:</p>



<ul>
<li>Network instability causing packet loss and rubber banding</li>



<li>Dynamic elements like custom weapon drops floating in midair</li>



<li>Weapon crates duplicating on interaction and falling into each other</li>



<li>Players falling under the map (and staying there)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-redeploy-teammates/">Redeploy towers</a> throwing teammates into the fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Teething issues are commonplace these days, and it’s hardly fair to take points away from the game, but you’d imagine that REDSEC would launch in a better state given the consistency of the multiplayer platform and how much stock Electronic Arts (and associated studios) have poured into the Battle Royale platform.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Being so close to Warzone, can REDSEC ultimately escape the competition?</figcaption></figure>







<p>If you’re going to give REDSEC a try, I’d recommend picking up a battle pass (ideally the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/">BF Pro battle pass</a>) if you think you’re going to sink a few hours into it. It adds another layer of meat to the bones of the game, and you’ll have a bit more to aim for. The core gameplay loop is fulfilling enough, but BRs have a tendency to get dull quite quickly under the strain of repetition.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Electronic Arts treats Battlefield REDSEC. For now, it’s a great Battle Royale title that has everything you’d expect from a Battlefield bolt-on, and I’m certainly going to invest more than a few hours into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-developing-two-more-games-edgy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-studios-is-developing-two-more-games-one-of-which-is-%E2%80%98edgy%E2%80%99.1337830/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is about to hit the market, introducing to the world one of the most popular extraction shooters around. For Embark Studios, it follows the earlier launch of The Finals, an arena-based, destructive first-person shooter that served as the studio’s debut title.</p>



<p>Embark Studios isn’t done when ARC Raiders is out, though. In a recent interview, the studio’s CEO, Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that the team is working on <strong>two new games</strong>, one of which has ‘a lot more edge to it’ than ARC Raiders or The Finals.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-the-other-is-more-conventional">But The Other is More Conventional</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Game Business, Embark’s CEO sat down to talk about the studio, its evolution, the release of ARC Raiders, and where things go from here. In one segment, the CEO, Patrick Soderlund, was asked about what other games are in development at the studio.</p>



<p>These projects are in the earlier, more conceptual stages, but there are <strong>two </strong>being pieced together. When asked if they’re all online games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONLWtl85bjU&amp;t=2141s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Soderlund explained</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That I think is just ingrained in our DNA. That doesn’t mean that they’re online games the same way as The Finals or ARC Raiders. One of the concepts we have, I would say, has a lot more <strong>edge </strong>to it than The Finals or ARC Raiders does.</p>



<p>The other one maybe is a little bit more conventional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Embark Studios has gone from strength to strength in the last few years, and the imminent arrival of ARC Raiders is a testament to the work the studio has put in. This is arguably going to be the most exciting and anticipated extraction shooter ever made, if the numbers are anything to go by.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the extraction genre has skyrocketed, particularly with the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a>, a parody title that has sold millions of copies in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>What kind of game do you think Embark Studios should make next? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-871-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-october-29.1337824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the middle of the week, and regardless of what your plans are for the day ahead, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints that you need to dominate today’s puzzle. It’s a tricky one today, and there are some very clever answers, but if you’re stumped, just read on to get the answers you need.</p>



<p>The top NYT Connections hints await.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-29">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 29)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #871:</p>



<ul>
<li>BACKBONE</li>



<li>MEDIUM</li>



<li>VENUE</li>



<li>SCRABBLE</li>



<li>SPIRIT</li>



<li>COMPUTER KEYBOARD</li>



<li>SACRUM</li>



<li>COURAGE</li>



<li>PLATFORM</li>



<li>SEYCHELLES</li>



<li>HEART</li>



<li>OUIJA BOARD</li>



<li>SEITAN</li>



<li>OUTLET</li>



<li>SÉANCE</li>



<li>ABECEDARIUM</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all relate to qualities that represent someone’s core or emotional resilience</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each term is a way to deliver content or host experiences</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each word is fun to ‘say’</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each term covers the full A to Z</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 29.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

This reimagined package comes loaded with not only the trademark HD-2D visuals, but also new features, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-remakes-brand-new-underwater-region-is-beautiful">new locations and new story content</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. As usual, it comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what is the final verdict?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067volmin&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>This follow-up to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, which is also part of The Erdrick Trilogy, has officially received a score of <strong>9/9/8/8</strong> from the four critics, giving the game a total score of <strong>34/40</strong> (<a href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92274">Ryokutya2089 via Gematsu</a>). And if you're wondering, the remake of the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1874">third game received</a> 8/9/9/9, adding up to a final score of 35/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the score from Famitsu for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. If you're planning to get this game on the Switch or Switch 2, just remember that there's no upgrade path for this one. The Switch 2 version is also a Game-Key Card release.</p>

<p>Here's a teaser...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There was recently news about the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> getting a demo on select platforms, and ahead of Halloween, it's now officially available on the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>You'll apparently be able to access the first levels of the game as SpongeBob and Patrick, and also some new abilities (thanks, Nintendo Everything). In general, you'll also be able to get an idea of what to expect before the full release next month on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Above is a trailer of the demo and below we have some PR about the story and adventure SpongeBob and Patrick will go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em><strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's been no official mention of a Switch release, so for now, this game remains exclusive to Switch 2 on Nintendo platforms.</p>

<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bb4dfbf579a54"><a title="Microsoft CEO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb4dfbf579a54/microsoft-ceo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last month, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated how Xbox would support Switch 2</a> and PlayStation 5 players going forward, and now the tech giant's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has chimed in.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142">Speaking to TBPN recently</a> about this "shifting" business model, Nadella mentioned how the company wants to be a "fantastic publisher" on every platform now that the Activision acquisition is complete and it's the "largest publisher" in the business.</p>
<p>He also compared this approach to the one Windows took with Microsoft Office. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now we are the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher - similar approach to what we did with Office, we want to be everywhere in every platform, so we want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the pc, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this expansion to more devices and platforms, Microsoft is still <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/huge-xbox-report-details-ambitious-next-gen-console-with-free-online-play">reportedly going ahead with its own next-generation</a> gaming plans, which will supposedly blur the lines between PC and Xbox. Nadella also seemingly backed up these reports in his latest interview while claiming Microsoft and gaming's biggest competition was no longer "other" gaming, but "short form video".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming [platforms], gaming's competition is short form video. And so if we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model - [the] best way to innovate is to have good margins because that's the way you can fund."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These comments from Microsoft's CEO follow Xbox's huge announcement last week that it would be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo</a></strong> to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/halo-confirmed-for-ps5-remake-of-first-game-out-in-2026?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">PlayStation for the first time</a>. On the Nintendo front, the Bethesda games <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a></strong> (IP now under Microsoft's banner) are both on the way to the Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

<p>According to the official patch notes on Nintendo's support page, Version 1.1.4 addresses "several issues" to improve gameplay on the new hybrid hardware. Nintendo doesn't go into the specifics, but if we hear anything, we'll let you know. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 1.1.4 (Released October 28, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2. Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This is actually Super Mario 3D All-Stars' third update this year. The previous two versions (1.1.3 and 1.1.2) have the same patch notes as the latest game patch. Again, if we find out what's going on here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Although patches are still being released for this game, keep in mind it's no longer available to purchase on the eShop and was available for a "limited-time" in stores. It contains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> game.</p>
<p>This update also happens to follow the recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> at the beginning of October. You can find out more about this new (<em>but old</em>) two-in-one release in our recent Nintendo Life review.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  This dual-basket air fryer from Ninja comes with smart thermometer technology that cooks two meals at once.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Cooking can feel overwhelming if you’ve never mastered timing, temperatures or knowing when meat is actually done. The Ninja <em>DZ550</em> <em>Foodi</em> solves these everyday kitchen frustrations by removing all the guesswork from meal preparation through its integrated thermometer that tells you exactly when your food reaches the perfect doneness level.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/">dropped this dual-basket air fryer from $249 down to just $129</a>, and the timing creates a great opportunity if you’re looking for restaurant-quality results without culinary school training. The <strong>two independent 5-quart baskets</strong> eliminate the stress of coordinating multiple dishes because the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature syncs everything to complete simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Two Independent Baskets That Transform Meal Preparation</h2>
<p>The <em>DualZone</em> Technology offers <strong>two completely separate cooking zones with independent fans and heaters in each 5-quart basket</strong>. You can air fry chicken wings in one basket at 400°F while roasting sprouts in the other at 375°F. Both finish cooking at the same time, thanks to the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature that automatically calculates timing differences. The <em>Match Cook</em> function copies your settings from one basket to the other instantly; this is very useful when you need to cook larger amounts of the same food in both baskets, and gives you a total 10-quart capacity. IQ Boost spreads the 1690 watts of power efficiently across both zones. This improves cooking speed when you are preparing different items at the same time.</p>



<p>The integrated Foodi thermometer takes the guesswork out of cooking proteins by continuously monitoring internal temperature throughout the cooking process. Just insert the probe into your chicken breast or pork chop, select your desired doneness level from rare to well-done, and the system alerts you as soon as your food reaches perfection. This feature is invaluable for novice cooks unsure when meat is safe to eat. It also prevents overcooking expensive cuts by constantly checking and maintaining heat. The temperature range goes from 105°F for gentle dehydrating up to 450°F for high-heat searing and air frying, allowing you control over every cooking method.</p>



<p><strong>Six cooking programs</strong> cover almost every meal preparation scenario you’ll encounter: <em>Air Fry</em> gives crispy results using little to no oil by circulating superheated air around food at high speeds and creates that satisfying crunch on fries, wings, and breaded items.<em> Air Broil</em> applies intense heat from above to caramelize the surfaces of meats and vegetables. <em>Roast</em> envelops food in moderate heat for even cooking, perfect for whole chickens or root vegetables. <em>Bake</em> offers consistent heat distribution for cookies, muffins, and casseroles. <em>Reheat</em> warms leftovers without making them soggy like microwaves do. <em>Dehydrate</em> removes moisture at low temperatures over long periods, making it ideal for jerky, dried fruits, or vegetable chips.</p>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch footprint fits two large baskets</strong> while keeping counter space in check. The unit cooks food up to 30% faster than conventional ovens by eliminating preheating time and focusing heat directly around the food. Both nonstick cooking baskets and crisper plates are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup, and the nonstick coating prevents food from sticking. The gray finish resists fingerprints and blends seamlessly into most kitchen color schemes. This air fryer turns frozen foods into crispy meals in about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the lowest price ever on this Ninja XL air fryer, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Playable Prototype of Pokémon Pokopia Has Leaked Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-playable-prototype-leak-teraleak-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playable-prototype-of-pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-has-leaked-online.1337740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An early prototype of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, Nintendo’s upcoming farming sim, has leaked online. Furthermore, it is fully playable in Unity and verified by the recent Teraleak.</p>



<p>Revealed earlier this year, Pokémon Pokopia is a joint collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo. The life-sim lets you play as a humanoid Ditto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-responds-to-pokopia-and-palfarm-comparisons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">befriending different Pokémon</a> and building a life for themselves. With crafting and farming, the title is one of 2026’s most anticipated games. However, it seems an early playable prototype of the title has been leaked, as well as information regarding its development.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-prototype-leaks-online-features-pixel-art-style">Pokémon Pokopia Prototype Leaks Online, Features Pixel-Art Style</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Teraleak: A complete unreleased prototype of Pokopia has been found, and we have the full Unity source code.</p><p>Pokopia originally looked a lot more like Stardew Valley than Minecraft. You would assign your Pokémon to build and harvest resources.</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/oNryTNkZNP">pic.twitter.com/oNryTNkZNP</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1983243634729165265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak first came from RyDawgE, who was then verified by the infamous Centro Leaks, who previously revealed much of Pokémon’s future with the Teraleak, like Gen 10. In a Twitter/X post, RyDawgE <a href="https://x.com/RyDawgE_/status/1983010050663751705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured in-game screenshots</a> and footage of an early prototype of Pokémon Pokopia. Centro Leaks then posted <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1983243634729165265">video footage of an early prototype</a>, seen above, and linked the apparent source code of the prototype, allowing anyone to play it on Unity.&nbsp;The leaker also claims that the project was originally all Game Freak before being outsourced to Koei Tecmo.</p>



<p>As you can see from the leak, Pokémon Pokopia looks quite different than what was revealed this year. Instead of the 3D style we know, it’s entirely pixel-art, similar to Stardew Valley. Early reports mention that the game was originally <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/pokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-1-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Nintendo Switch 1 title</a> and a successor to Pokémon: Let’s Go from the Teraleak. Fans online have expressed enthusiasm over the art style and visuals, as it feels reminiscent of older titles. While knowing this is what the game could’ve been, it does seem like, if this is what the final product will play like, it’ll be a great one.</p>



<p>What do you think about Pokémon Pokopia’s early prototype? Do you wish the game kept the pixel art style? Has it made you more or less excited for the full release in 2026?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-airpods-the-galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-selling-for-pennies-and-amazon-sold-30k-units-2000639654</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-4-pro-only-have-one-shot-at-challenging-airpods-pro-3-2000677942">rumors about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are swirling around</a> but here’s the real deal you need to know right now: The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon, and they’re crushing the competition, including Apple’s AirPods Pro. These earbuds combine top-tier active noise cancellation with cutting-edge AI features that adapt to your environment in real-time: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">slashed the price from $249 down to just $165, and over 30,000 people have already grabbed them</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Sound Engineering That Rivals Studio Headphones</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have been totally revamped by Samsung from the ground up: The dual-driver design used in them stands them out in terms of design from almost every earbud existing on the market. In each earbud, there’s a 10.5mm dynamic woofer that’s complimented by a 6.1mm planar magnetic tweeter that’s driven by dual amplifiers. The two-way speaker design provides an outstanding separation of bass and high details.</p>
<p>This opens an incredible soundstage that’s as spacious as it gets considering that it’s an earbud. The stems on these earbuds aren’t only fashionable – inside them reside cutting-edge microphones that enable the adaptive functions and provide sound that’s as clear as it gets on calls that have a 15kHz bandwidth.</p>



<p>The <strong>adaptative active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI</strong> adjusts based on your environment and automatically reaches peak isolation levels throughout your daily routine. Riding on a crowded subway to work? The noise cancellation amps up to max isolation levels. Headed to your favorite coffee shop that’s a bit less crowded? The noise cancellation adjusts to save on battery life while still staying focused on your work.</p>
<p>The system automatically pairs perfectly with Siren Detect capabilities that automatically shift you to ambient mode as soon as it picks up emergency vehicle sounds. All of these come in conjunction with an adaptive equalizer that automatically adjusts based on the earbuds’ fit inside your ears. In plain sight, it adjusts sound profiles based on acoustic leakage. No matter whether it’s a workout routine or working at your desk, these earbuds deliver constant levels of optimized sound. The earbuds’ <strong>water-resistant rating of IP57</strong> guarantees extreme durability despite exposure to rain or heavy sweating.</p>



<p>Galaxy AI integration offers capabilities that genuinely add value as opposed to just being catchy: The <strong>real-time interpreter offers face-to-face conversation translations via your earbuds</strong>. This overcomes language barriers during travel or international business meetings: The service enables you to answer calls in a given language and receive translations of those conversations in another. This functionality functions during earbud conversations via the Samsung Phone app.</p>
<p>Battery life provides the same six hours with ANC enabled and seven hours without it, <strong>which goes up to 26 hours when using the wireless charging case</strong>. The charging case design includes a transparent lid as well as an easy-to-carry design that fits perfectly inside your pocket. The charging slot for wired charging is positioned at the bottom of the charging case.</p>
<p>The earbuds come equipped with the latest connectivity of Bluetooth 5.4. They also feature Auracast that enables easy broadcasting of sound to nearby devices with Auracast capabilities. The company provides an additional two-year Amazon warranty exclusively for Samsung users.</p>
<p>All these factors combined at such an unbelievable low cost make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro an incomparable value.</p>

Following the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven update, there will be no more new content released for New World: Aeternum.</p><p>The announcement was shared <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the game's official site</a> by developer Amazon Games Orange County. This doesn't mean that the game is going offline yet, and the devs indicated it will remain online through 2026. Beyond that, there are no guarantees. But there is a small consolation for players, now that the Nighthaven update will be free. </p><p>"The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles," reads the statement from the developers. "It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players."</p><p>New World: Aeternum will remain available on PlayStation Plus for Extra and Premium subscribers, but even the developers aren't sure when that arrangement will expire. During the game's new phase, bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements will continue, and players can continue to buy and download the game. There will still be world bosses, bonus weeks, and "some seasonal events," but holiday events are now canceled. </p><p>The development team also stated that it will "provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum." </p>

              <p>Winter’s arrival brings shorter days and unpredictable weather which makes backup power more important than ever. Power outages can strike at the worst moments, leaving you without heat, refrigeration or the ability to charge essential devices. That’s where portable power stations come in, and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5064/">Amazon has dropped the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic (1800 AC output) to an all-time low of $399, down from $599</a>. This is the Classic model, which differs from the base Delta 3 by offering a more streamlined feature set at a much lower price point. For most households, the Classic delivers everything you need without the premium add-ons.</p>

<p>The Delta 3 Classic comes with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that holds immense value in terms of practical battery life. LiFePO4 battery life may sound like an advertising gimmick at first: The truth remains that LiFePO4 batteries enjoy an <strong>unmatched lifespan of more than 10 years</strong>. That simply implies that you can power this power bank thousands of times with minimal capacity loss.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1800W of continuous power</strong> supports your necessary electronics without an issue. The fridge in your house may not get power. Carry a space heating device to heat your room. No issues at all. Coffee maker in the early morning hours at your camping site. Nothing is more important than that. The<strong> X-Boost Technology increases your power capacity to 2600W</strong>. The starting surge power of 3600W provides power to your devices that consume high startup power without shutting your system down.</p>



<p>Charging speed is what sets good power stations from great ones: In that respect, the Delta 3 Classic stands out. The X-Stream AC charging system gets your power <strong>levels from zero to 80 percent in only 45 minutes</strong>. Consider that for a moment: In that amount of time, it takes to watch an episode of your favorite TV show, you’ll have enough power to last your laptop an entire workday as well as keep your fridge full of cold food throughout an outage.</p>
<p>The &lt;10ms UPS or uninterrupted power supply function may not seem like much at first, but it’s actually an enormously helpful addition. As someone who works from home and deals with flickering power supplies on a daily basis, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic’s seamless changeover from power to battery backup means that your computer won’t miss a beat.</p>



<p>The ability to charge via solar power raises the functionality of the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic to a whole new level. Using an optional 500W solar panel, you’ll be able to recharge the power station within 2.5 hours of direct sunshine. This turns the power solution from being an emergency power solution system to being a long-term off-grid power solution. Planning an adventure camping experience at a remote destination over an extended weekend? Use your solar solution setup during the day. No power at your destination due to a power outage? Solar charging solutions ensure that you’re not off grid.</p>
<p>At $399, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic provides an incredible value within the portable power station industry.</p>

              <p>Digital storage needs spiral out of control faster than you can keep up with them, and watching your available space shrink while cloud subscription costs climb month after month creates a frustrating cycle that never ends.</p>
<p>Seagate has lost its mind <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">with the pricing on its 20TB Expansion HDD, slashing it to $229 from the $499 launch price</a> which creates the situation where this massive drive costs less than the 12TB model still sitting at $299 on Amazon. You’re <strong>paying around $0.01 per gigabyte</strong>, half the launch cost and <strong>roughly ten times cheaper than equivalent SSD storage</strong> for this kind of capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Mechanical Beats Solid State on Value</h2>
<p>SSDs dominate performance conversations with their 2,000 MB/s transfer speeds and instant access times, but when you need to store 20 terabytes of data, the math shifts dramatically in favor of mechanical drives: A 2TB SSD runs $150 to $200 (putting it at $0.07 to $0.10 per gigabyte) while this Seagate unit delivers the same price for ten times the capacity.</p>
<p>This <strong>Seagate drive pushes data at 220 to 246 MB/s over USB 3.0</strong> which handles large backup operations, media library management and archive storage without breaking a sweat since you’re not booting operating systems or running applications from external storage anyway. Moving a 50GB file takes roughly four to five minutes which is perfectly adequate for transferring weekend photo shoots or shuffling game installations between drives.</p>



<p>The quoted capacity of 20TB provides ample capacity for the <strong>retention of more than 5 million high-definition images at 3.5MB each, 4,000 hours of video at 1080p resolution, or 50 full game copies of 100GB on average</strong>. The drive comes pre-formatted with exFAT and allows it to work seamlessly with both Windows computers and computers from Apple without needing to format it once.</p>
<p>The setup process could not be simpler since you simply attach <strong>the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable from the drive’s micro-USB connector to your computer’s USB port</strong> and attach the 18W power adaptor to an electrical outlet. The set comes with international plug adapters that fit on the power brick; thus, various electrical outlets found in different nations won’t pose a problem. No need to install anything on your system since the process of getting underway happens in less than a minute as you simply drag files from your system to the drive icon on your desktop to copy them or drag them back to retrieve them.</p>



<p>The drive has the advantage of supporting backward compatibility on older ports of version 2.0. However, data transfer rates on these ancient interfaces become 30 to 40 MB/s. The power gadget uses wall current as opposed to drawing power from the universal bus. As such, the drive has unrestricted access to 7200 RPM on 3.5-inch disks without reducing laptop power without overstressing the power output on USB connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>data recovery services from Seagate come free</strong> with every purchase for professional data recovery needed in the worst of circumstances of drive failure and comes at an added cost of $500-$2,000. The limited lifetime hardware parts and labor warranty given by the company insures that the buyer can get a replacement should anything fail within a year of purchase.</p>
<p>The competitive pricing of this offer makes it even more impressive since Western Digital’s 20TB drives usually starts at $400 and enterprise-oriented solutions from companies like G-Technology cost $400-$500. In comparison to that, the lowest-priced category of drives like the <strong>reviewed Seagate solution offers the same capacity and speed at a way more affordable price</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-arena-board-game-blasts-on-to-kickstarter.1337674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doom-arena-board-game-will-rip-and-tear-until-it-is-done" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom Arena Board Game</em></a> is live. Publisher Modiphius is using the power of crowdfunding to bring two distinct board game adaptations of the iconic shooter franchise to gaming tables inspired by its two distinct eras.</p>

<h2>The <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>As the official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/doom-arena-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> aims to bring the carnage and fast-paced strategic combat of the Doom series into a tabletop experience. To that end, the game is an asymmetrical experience. One player controls Doom Guy; the other one controls the Hordes of Hell.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-arena-board-game-board-promo.jpg?itok=X-mYJDuz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-arena-board-game-board-promo.jpg?itok=eo1X1s2b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A single game of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> is broken up into three rounds. Whenever someone deals damage to the opponent, they generate Blood and Tempo. Tempo is used for certain powerful abilities. Between each round, players can spend Arsenal Points to either summon stronger demons or get stronger weapons. Whoever spills the most Blood after round 3 wins.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign includes two versions of the game. <em>Doom (1993) Arena Board Game</em> is based on the original PC release that started it all. This version will include stylized miniatures of classic <em>Doom</em> enemies, the Doom Guy, and old-school maps. The second one, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent release</a>, complete with its dark medieval fantasy aesthetic.</p>

<p>Notably, the campaign includes some variation with the game's pieces. If you're frugal, there's a version of the game with acrylic standees. But if you want to pay extra, you can buy unpainted miniatures for either game. This includes Kickstarter-exclusive versions of both the Doom Guy and Doom Slayer miniatures.</p>

<p>There are several stretch goals and add-ons promoted as well. These include alternate miniature sculpts, Demon Reinforcement packs that add new enemies to the game, themed dice trays, and expansions that add new enemies and allies like the Arch Vile and the mecha dragon Serrat.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Standard Edition for $61:</em> Your choice of the standee version of either Doom (1993) or Doom: The Dark Ages board game</li>
	<li><em>Premium Edition for $81:</em> Your choice of the miniatures version of either Doom (1993) or Doom: The Dark Ages board game</li>
	<li><em>Both Premium Editions and Reinforcements for $254:</em> Miniature versions of both games and both Demon Reinforcements add-ons</li>
	<li><em>All-In&nbsp;for $441:</em> Everything in&nbsp;Both Premium Editions and Reinforcements tier, all expansions, and two themed dice trays</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$92,162, which is short of its initial funding goal of&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>$133,559. The campaign ends on November 21 and the game is expected to ship to backers on October, 2026.</span></span></span></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/808545/youtube-graphic-video-game-violence-age-restriction</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube-will-restrict-more-content-showing-%E2%80%98graphic-violence%E2%80%99-in-video-games.1337650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>YouTube is updating its policy to age-restrict more content containing video game scenes with “graphic violence,” <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/383711785?hl=en&amp;sjid=3922247506148764624-NC">the company announced on Tuesday</a>. The update will go into effect on November 17th and will prevent accounts under 18 and signed-out users from watching videos with games focused on showing “realistic human characters” involved in scenes of “mass violence against non-combatants” or torture.</p><p>When choosing whether to restrict a video, YouTube says it will take the length of the graphic scene into account, as well as whether it’s zoomed in or the main focus of a scene. It will also evaluate whether the video shows violence targeted at a character “that looks like a real human.” YouTube’s post doesn’t clarify if this applies to the violence seen in games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> sequence like the infamous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201735/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-release">“No Russian” mission</a>, or other kinds of realistically rendered scenes.</p><p>However, YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that “certain content may be age-restricted if it’s non-fleeting or zoomed in,” adding that “there may be ways the creator can choose to play the mission to avoid content that would lead to an age restriction.” Creators can also choose to blur or obscure the violence, according to Bullwinkle.</p><p>The update builds upon <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802008?hl=en">YouTube’s existing policies</a>, which state that the platform may restrict videos featuring “dramatized violence” focused on torture, severe injuries, or violent deaths with blood, with an exception for games. The current policy says, “Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.”</p><p>“YouTube’s policies are designed to adapt to the evolving digital world, and these updates reflect our ongoing commitment to protect younger users and foster a responsible platform,” Bullwinkle said.</p><p>In addition to stricter policies surrounding video games, the update will also prevent creators from directing users to online gambling content involving digital goods, like video game skins, cosmetics, or NFTs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623985/youtube-online-gambling-rules-restrictions">YouTube stopped allowing creators</a> to verbally mention or display online gambling services not approved by Google in March. The platform started blocking approved online gambling content for users under 18 at this time, and now it’s planning to age-restrict social casino content as well.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 28th: </strong>Added clarification from YouTube.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808545/youtube-graphic-video-game-violence-age-restriction]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-60000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000639627</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-60-000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1337647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your phone dies at the worst moments. Your laptop battery gives up mid-presentation. Power outages leave you sitting in the dark scrolling through a phone at 5% battery. Generic power banks help a little but they barely charge your phone twice before needing a recharge themselves. The Anker <em>PowerCore Reserve</em> changes the game with 60,000mAh of capacity that can <strong>charge an iPhone 17 over ten times</strong>. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/"> just dropped this powerhouse to $79, down from $149</a>, hitting an all-time low price that costs barely more than a no-name 10,000mAh power bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Battery Technology That Lasts a Decade</h2>
<p>The power bank uses LiFePO4 battery types. Although it may sound complicated, it’s actually very important: In normal Li-ion batteries used by those cheap power banks that last only a year at most, the charging cycle ends at 500 to 1,000 cycles. The power bank from Anker uses 3,000 cycles: That’s three thousand charging cycles or complete discharge cycles before the battery’s capacity reaches 80%. <strong>That’s around a decade of normal life</strong>.</p>
<p>The true advantage of LiFePO4 over a standard lithium ion battery is more than endurance: This form of battery prevents thermal runaway. In technical terms, LiFePO4 <strong>prevents overheating of a battery</strong> that eventually leads to it exploding in a fire. The high temperature tolerability of LiFePO4 ranges from –4°F to 140°F which makes it ideal for winter camping or summer road travel.</p>



<p>The <strong>192Wh battery capacity translates to 60,000mAh with a cell voltage of 3.2V</strong>. The battery provides enough power to charge a MacBook Air 2.9 times or power an LED light of 3 watts for 42.3 hours. The LED power duration comes in handy during prolonged power outages of several days when you may require constant illumination without having to recharge smartphones. The <strong>power bank comes with four charging ports</strong>: These include <strong>two charging sockets of 27W and 60W</strong> through the USB C charging sockets.</p>
<p>The <strong>XT60 input port supports the connection of solar panels</strong> with a capacity of up to 60W: The Anker power station can now become a sustainable off-grid power solution (the solar panels are not included). The power station takes around four hours to recharge with a 60W USB C wall charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital smart display</strong> takes over the face of the front panel and comes with information such as battery life, input power level, output power level, and estimated remaining life. This provides real-time data that helps you determine perfectly the amount of power being used and the remaining life based on current power levels. No need to guess whether you’ll have enough power to last the night.</p>
<p>The device measures <strong>4.59 inches wide, 4.59 inches deep, and 8.17 inches high</strong>: That’s comparable in size to a large water bottle. Weighing 5.1 pounds makes it heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to throw into a backpack or emergency kit. The green cloth exterior provides good traction that won’t slide off and comes with a flat-folded handle.</p>
<p>For $79 for a 60,000mAh LiFePO4 power bank that can recharge from the sun’s power, you’re paying pennies – 0.001 per milliamp-hour. That’s a fraction of what each power bank on the market costs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbls-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio-2000639597</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl%E2%80%99s-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio.1337644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tiny speakers get no respect, but they solve a real problem. Your phone’s speaker sounds terrible. Your laptop barely projects past your keyboard. You need music in places where dragging a full-size speaker makes zero sense: the shower, the kitchen counter while cooking, your workbench in the garage, or clipped to your backpack on a winter hike. Amazon just dropped the JBL Go 3 to $29, down from $39, hitting an all-time low price that puts this rugged Bluetooth speaker cheaper than most wired alarm clocks. At this price, you’re paying less than a dollar per hour of battery life for a speaker that can survive getting dropped in a snowbank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pocket-Sized Power That Survives Everything</h2>
<p>The JBL Go 3 has a width of 3.4 inches by 2.7 inches high and 1.6 inches deep, and a weight of 0.46 pounds. The speaker has a 43 x 47mm driver that produces 4.2 watts of sound: The sound signature of JBL’s Pro Sound design <strong>includes bass response from the tiny speaker</strong> instead of high-pitched treble on lower-priced models. The frequency response of the speaker includes 110 Hz to 20kHz to encompass the full range of your hearing.</p>
<p>The <strong>rating of IP67 water resistant and dust resistant</strong> provides that it can withstand being submerged in full water, at a depth of a meter for 30 minutes. Place it in your shower as you rinse off the chill. Use it on your countertop as you clean dishes from dinner. Attach it to your jacket as you walk out into the snow and aren’t concerned as freezing rain begins to fall. The speaker won’t slip from the countertop or smooth surface as it sits there. The attached loop of cloth that comes with it enables you to attach it to your shower hooks or carabiners.</p>



<p>The speaker <strong>comes with Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity that connects rapidly to smartphones</strong>, tablets, and laptops and provides a constant connectivity connection from 10 to 15 meters away. The five buttons on top of the speaker control power on/off, pair the speaker with devices via Bluetooth connectivity, play/pause music as well as increase and decrease the sound volume.</p>
<p>Battery life goes an <strong>estimated five hours on a single charge</strong> but it’s been known to extend well beyond that based on overall audio output levels. Charging only takes 2.5 hours via the new USB C port. This leaves behind those days of digging around for a proprietary charging cord only found in your smoking hot new TV or powering a brick-sized micro-USB wall charger.</p>



<p>The internal microphone provides speakerphone capability with noise and echo reduction: This makes it a convenience device for when <strong>you want to take your calls while cooking in the kitchen or showering</strong>. The speaker design provides mono sound that resonates from the front on one side. The rubber on the back of the speaker prevents it from slipping: This particular design trait appears practical for transportability as opposed to stereo sound that you won’t be needing inside a shower or kitchen.</p>
<p>At $29, the speaker may be purchased for less than the average ticket to a movie and provides years of enjoyment. Budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers usually have to cut back on either sound quality, durability, or battery life. The Go 3 doesn’t scrimp on anything in those departments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to imagine what first-person shooters would be like today, if they were to exist at all, without the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom">original DOOM</a>, released back on December 10, 1993, for MS-DOS. A lone super soldier, the legendary Doom Guy, fending off the hordes of demons from hell is one of the defining images of PC gaming, and the series continues to shock and amaze fans to this day with every new gory entry. Now, Modiphius Entertainment is bringing DOOM to the tabletop with the upcoming Doom Arena Board Game, now on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Kickstarter</u></a>, and I had a chance to get some time with a prototype to see just how well I could rip and tear in my dining room.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomboard-1761661236811.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Doom Arena isn't the first cardboard adaptation of the series, this latest rendition is a bloodbath contest between one player controlling Doom Guy and the other controlling the demons. Taking place in – you guessed it, an arena – the two players maneuver their plastic forces around the hexagon grid-based warzone, competing to see who can dish out the most pain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point. The winner is whoever comes out ahead in two out of the three rounds by earning the most blood, with each round consisting of six turns each for both sides. Between rounds, both Doom Guy and the Demons can upgrade their arsenals. Doom Guy gets new weapons and armor, while the Demons swap out weaker enemies for hartier ones like Pinky, Cacodemons, or the mighty Cyberdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom Arena is one of those games that fits great as a filler between some heavier ones during a game day, or when you just want to have some fun while sipping a cold one and munching on some snacks. The gameplay is a slick dice-chucker where the strategy takes a back seat to running in guns blazing and seeing how much pain you unleash, which is very reminiscent of its source material. The only real "strategy" I found myself thinking about is what upgrades I was going to spend my resources on between rounds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-2-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate the simpler ruleset behind Doom Arena, because you can explain the rules to friends pretty quickly and be rolling dice shortly after. That being said, I wouldn't complain if there were a smidgen more depth to be found. To be fair, the prototype I had access to and a work-in-progress ruleset included only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> game modes, whereas the final game will be playable with 2-4 players, so it's possible the additional depth I am hoping for will be found in the final rules and other game modes. On the topic of game modes, I will say that having official rules for starting with more upgrades is smart, and makes for a ton of chaotic fun, and I could see some great matches happen by adopting a pick/counter-pick approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The version of Doom Arena that I played featured miniatures showcasing the classic looks of Doom Guy and demons that players of the original game from the '90s will recognize. But those who jumped on the chainsaw wagon in more recent decades will have a version for them, too. Modiphius is producing a mechanically identical version that instead has arenas, models, and weapons pulled from the most recent Doom: The Dark Ages, with Doom Guy replaced by the menacing Doom Slayer and demons including the Mancubus, Imps, Imp Stalkers, Hell and Battle Knights, Pinky Rider, Arachnotron, and Soldiers. And for folks who may be lacking in storage space, Modiphius will also offer a version that replaces the plastic miniatures with acrylic standees, shrinking the box size and lowering the cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-3-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first heard the announcement that Modiphius was designing a new Doom board game, my mind immediately went to images of playing as Doom Guy, exploring corridors, finding keys to unlock doors, that eventually would lead to a fight with a big scary demon. Something more akin to say a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a>, Cthulu: Death May Die, or Zombicide. I still would love a Doom game like that, but I can't deny that Doom Arena captures the spirit of these games splendidly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a series about killing as many things as fast as possible, and Arena delivers on that premise in an exciting and digestible package. Even playing dice with this WIP build led to tense moments where I had to hold my breath as I rolled my dice, or giant sighs of relief as my demons avoided being brutally dismembered by a chainsaw. I eagerly look forward to seeing what sort of additional elements or add-ons will be available to play around with and what sort of other game modes will ship in the final release that use <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>. With the Doom Arena Board Game, Modphius looks to deliver a box that fans of both the video games and board games in general can enjoy, and I am counting down the days until I can rev up my chainsaw again and take it to some demons again.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-5-1761661236812.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom the Arena Board Game’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">campaign</a> runs until November 21, 2025 with an expected delivery date of October 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-wants-games-%E2%80%98to-be-on-every-platform%E2%80%99.1337617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the company <strong>wants to put its games “on every platform”</strong>. Just recently, Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of Combat Evolved, is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading to PlayStation consoles</a> at launch, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> made the jump to PlayStation 5, as will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025</a>. Many Xbox exclusives have slowly been heading to different consoles. Now, it seems this is the start of many, maybe even ending the exclusivity fans have come to respect forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-wants-its-games-to-be-everywhere-says-ceo-satya-nadella">Microsoft Wants Its Games To Be Everywhere, Says CEO Satya Nadella</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The consoles wars are now over. What does that mean for Microsoft's gaming business model?</p><p>"We just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere; consoles, PC, mobile, cloud, or TV." – <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@satyanadella</a> <a href="https://t.co/AOGf3mj0Kf">pic.twitter.com/AOGf3mj0Kf</a></p></div>— TBPN (@tbpn) <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TBPN</a>, as the group chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the company’s new partnership with OpenAI. The CEO talks a bit about Xbox and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/white-house-uses-ai-donald-trump-master-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘end’ of the console wars</a>. In the clip, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1983255817785597980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transcribed by GameFile’s Stephen Totilo</a>, Nadella states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” says Nadella to TBPN. “To us, gaming on Windows, and of course Steam – has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it.&nbsp;So to us, the way we are thinking about gaming is; let’s first of all, now we are the largest publisher, after the Activision [deal] so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office. <strong>We’re going to be everywhere, in every platform</strong>. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming – or the TV; <strong>we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not too surprising to see Microsoft and Xbox shed the exclusivity factor. Many games, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-drop-about-90-in-japan/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, sold less than stellar due to sticking to one console. While it’s franchises, especially Halo, never seemed to have that problem, it may lead to more sales. Still, the recent shift, plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lackluster sales of Xbox Series X|S</a>, do ring out a touch off for the once-influential company. Whether it’s next console, rumored for a 2027 release, is going to include big changes is unclear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon Game Studios has announced that just four years after release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-days-with-new-world-amazon-s-extravagant-food-harv-1847777090">its once-popular MMORPG <em>New World</em></a> will no longer receive content updates as it slowly begins its journey to the end.</p> <p>On October 28, shortly after news broke that Amazon was planning to lay off thousands of employees, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">Amazon Game Studios posted an update on <em>New World’</em>s official website</a> confirming that the game’s recently launched season 10 and Nighthaven update will be its last. In the post, the devs said that after an “incredible journey” with the community, <em>New World</em> has reached a point where it is “no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” The MMORPG’s last big content drop, Nighthaven, has been made free to all PC players, as has the game’s <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion, which is needed to play Nighthaven.</p> <p><span>“Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this </span><span><i>New World</i></span><span> adventure an unforgettable journey,” said the devs.&nbsp; “We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you. Thank you for helping make this game something truly special.”</span></p>

 <p>To be clear, <em>New World</em> isn’t shutting down today or any time this year. In an included FAQ, the devs claim players will still be able to play the game normally on all platforms, bug fixes will still happen, and you’ll even be able to keep buying in-game currency. The servers will remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.” The studio says it will provide more details on <em>New World’</em>s future in the coming months and promised to provide a minimum of six months’ notice before shutting down the servers and killing the game completely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>While <em>New World</em> isn’t dead yet, the writing is on the wall for the MMORPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-populated-new-world-servers-no-longer-allowing-new-1847790460">which at one point was one of the most played games on Steam</a>. In October 2021, <em>New World</em> launched to over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. It was a genuine smash hit for Amazon, a company that, up until that point, had struggled (and continues to struggle) to break into the game industry. But by March of 2022, player counts slipped into the mid 30-thousands and continued to dwindle. A console port and some big updates over the years helped keep <em>New World</em> afloat, but it seems like Amazon is finally done spending money on its once-popular MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">as the retail giant rushes to replace people with AI.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon layoffs</a>, <strong>New World is stopping development</strong> and ending with Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update. The news comes after more than 14,000 were let go from Amazon and its affiliates like Twitch. </p>



<p>Released in 2021 on PC and in 2024 for consoles, New World, also known as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World Aeternum</a>, is an MMORPG from Amazon Games. It was revealed as one of three titles announced to be in development for Amazon. New World was the only one to succeed, despite abandoning its original free-to-play entry. Unfortunately, the game’s journey will stop here, unfortunately ending development and future updates.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the New World team</a> on the official website, development on the game has ended. According to the team, <strong>further support is no longer sustainable</strong> and have pulled the cord. The recent Season 10 and Nighthaven update, which launched earlier this month, are the final updates. <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the blog</a>, the team states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, <strong>we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates</strong>. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are now free for fans on PC and Aeternum will remain on PS+ Premium and Extra for the time being. <strong>Servers for New World will remain open through 2026</strong>, with more information regarding the game’s future to be revealed at a later date. </p>



<p>While not stated in the blog, the team was hit with multiple firings due to today’s massive-scale Amazon layoff. A report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/">which we wrote on</a>, said that Amazon’s game studios were hit hard. Specifically, the layoffs were felt hardest for teams developing MMOs, like Amazon Game Studios. Sadly, this will likely be the first of many bad news stories surrounding the topic, as the studios were working on multiple new titles that are now in jeopardy.</p>
