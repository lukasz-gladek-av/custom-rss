            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has a distinctive French style from its Montpellier-based developer Sandfall Interactive, but originally it was very different.</p>
<p>Fans have uncovered a trailer from an early version of the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordThisForFree/comments/g5a6e8/game_ambitious_aa_game_project_looking_for_3/">posted on reddit</a> by director Guillaume Broche in a bid to find voice actors. The post, from five years ago, describes the project as an "ambitious AA game" and "3D modern take on the JRPG genre with western style characters". It had a planned release on PC and "possibly" PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to a draft trailer that's since been shared elsewhere. The game was originally called We Lost, and shows a steampunk town, fantastical boss battles, and even a sci-fi section.</p>

<p>It's likely much of the trailer is using placeholder assets, but it at least gives a glimpse into the development process. What's more, turn-based battles seem to have always been part of the project, as do the names of characters Lune and Maelle.</p>
<p>Further, lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen has detailed how the game's setting was completely different in its early phases.</p>
<p>"The gameplay would have been similar," she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a>, "but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."</p>
<p>A call with potential investors inspired Broche to "think bigger", Svedberg-Yen added, which prompted a complete re-think of the narrative. It was ultimately inspired by a painting Broche admired and a short story Svedberg-Yen was working on, which revolved around an artist entering her own canvases.</p>

</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly succeeds in part due to its French authenticity - from its fashion sense, to its jokey references to baguettes and mimes. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">French President Macron has taken note</a>, calling the game a "shining example of French audacity".</p>
<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," I wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed, developer Skydance Games has announced, with the game now aiming to arrive sometime in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>A couple of months prior to this announcement, Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-the-hydra-could-launch-this-holiday-says-voice-actor/">suggested</a> that the game would be arriving this coming holiday season. Well, clearly, plans changed compared to what Payton was last told, as Skydance says the decision to delay the game was made to give the team more time to "<em>add more polish</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026</em>," developer Skydance Games began in its short statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">X</a>. "<em>Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!</em>"</p>
<p>Published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/">Plaion</a> and developed by a team at Skydance Games led by the legendary Amy Hennig, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has a lot of strong potential. The few trailers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">we've seen</a> depict a pretty impressive-looking game and a story that could be one of the better tales we've gotten from anything Marvel in recent years.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see some gameplay by now, though, as we've all been waiting since <a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/">2022</a> to see this game come to fruition. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> right around the corner, there's always a chance we're not too far off from getting that first gameplay look.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-set-to-air-in-december.1188006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>streaming show has been renewed for a third season, and we now know roughly when the second season will be airing as well.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Amazon says that&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two will air in December, although the streaming giant stops short of announcing exactly when we can expect the show to land during that month.</p>

<p>As Amazon itself points out,&nbsp;confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season three "comes well in advance of the show's second season", so it's clear that the company is putting a lot of eggs into its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>basket. Still, given the show's popularity, that isn't too surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=nlX1ZVAo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=Y6wav9A3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show will be returning for a third season, Amazon has confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>The first season of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-amazon-prime-tv-show-premiere-date-officially-revealed-it-will-be-canon" rel="nofollow">began airing in April last year</a>, and it quickly found an audience, becoming Amazon Prime Video's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">second show to hit 100 million viewers</a>. In case you're wondering what the first show was, that honor obviously goes to&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>.</p>

<p>The show follows former Vault 33 resident Lucy, who leaves her home in search of her father. As she wanders the wasteland, she meets the likes of Walton Goggins' gunslinger The Ghoul, New California Republic commander Lee Moldaver, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus.</p>

<p>While the first season takes place in Los Angeles and its surroundings, the second will take Lucy to New Vegas, following on from the first season's finale (which I won't be discussing here for fear of spoilers).</p>

<p>Amazon hasn't revealed too much about the story for the second season and whether we can expect it to mirror its video game namesake, but we'll likely get more info about&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=UGao1R4i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=dWDGu8Kf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout</em>'s second season will take viewers to New Vegas.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also not clear where&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>'s third season will take place, although it'll likely be a while before we learn that given that the second season won't air for another seven months or so.</p>

<p>In any case, the second season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>airs this December. There's still no word yet on whether Bethesda will be developing a new game in the series anytime soon, but if I was Todd Howard, I'd be thinking about capitalizing on the show's success. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>(‘s voice actor) suggested that Skydance New Media’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> would release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydras-release-may-fall-in-christmas-2025-according-to-the-black-panther">in Christmas 2025</a>. We all slept a little easier that night, knowing that King T'Chanda himself had all but rubber-stamped the WW2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>’s launch window. Well, it turns out the Black Panther was lying to us. Skydance have just announced that it’ll now release in early 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">this TwiX post</a>, it’s all for the sake of adding Polish localisation. Sorry, I meant for polishing. Terrible joke, terrible joke, but I regret nothing and I'd do it again, I tell you. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision,” the post explains.</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">formally announced</a> in March 2024, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-new-studio-are-making-a-marvel-game">appears to have been in the works since 2021</a>. Directed by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and Uncharted shot-caller Amy Hennig, it follows Captain “Steve Rogers” America and Black Panther through occupied Paris, and introduces a couple of original characters, “Howling Commandos” squaddie Gabriel Jones and Wakandan secret agent Nanali, all four of whom are playable at points in the story. Nope, there's no co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>You can expect much shield-lobbing and jaw-clubbing, a conspiracy or two, and some clashes between superheroes. Also probably a lot of banter as Cap and Panther pander to fans or punch Panzers. If it handles anything like Uncharted, I imagine it would have made a fair Xmas play. Alas.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">If you think Switch 2's price of $450 seems a tad steep, then you are not alone. In fact, Nintendo has admitted the entry cost--especially considering the original Switch debuted at $300--could affect early hardware sales for the upcoming hybrid system.</p><p dir="ltr">During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">financial results briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 systems in this fiscal year</a> (which would roughly be 10 months for the console itself). Furukawa implied that the price point is one of the biggest factors into the calculation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Nintendo Switch 2 is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so we recognize that there are corresponding challenges to early adoption," said Furukawa. "That being said, Nintendo Switch 2 can play compatible Nintendo Switch software, so there is continuity between the platforms. We are taking steps like bundling software with the hardware to accelerate adoption in the first fiscal year, aiming to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">Furukawa seemed to dismiss the idea that production or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">the US tariff situation</a> factored into the numbers. Instead, the Nintendo president continued stressing Switch 2's price point as well knowing "it will not be easy to keep that momentum [with hardware sales] going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-scammers-are-convincing-people-they-won-the-nintendo-lottery-in-japan/1100-6531112/">Switch 2 preorders are off to a hot start</a>, and they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">sold out almost immediately in the US</a> last month.

The Doom Slayer is instantly recognizable thanks to his hulking physique and signature battlesuit, which has been tweaked once again to match the medieval themes of the new Doom game. But what would that armor look like in real life? Very cool, and <em>very </em>cumbersome for the person inside it. But mostly cool.</p><p>YouTuber Emily the Engineer--who specializes in 3D prints and builds on her channel--was tasked with bringing the Doom Slayer's armor to life by Bethesda, as the company sent her the official game-model files to use for this ambitious project. What followed was a Herculean effort to get the files ready for 3D-printing, a mind-numbing amount of sanding, painting, and figuring out how to fit into a suit of armor that looked like it was designed for Reacher actor Alan Ritchson to wear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3tt0BRPmKk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p3tt0BRPmKk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The end result is still impressive, even if moving around in the costume is a bit on the cumbersome side because of the sheer number of armor pieces here. The final build is quite intimidating, and if you had something like this on display in your home, it would make for an instant neck-turner.</p><p>While most of us don't have access to a small army of 3D printers, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/become-the-doom-slayer-with-this-replica-doom-the-dark-ages-helmet/1100-6530251/">official Doom Slayer replica helmet</a>. Priced at $175, it features LED light effects, an adjustable strap, and it looks like it was ripped straight from the game. It also comes with a Doom keycard replica and three woven patches as extras.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15--or right now if you preordered the Premium or Collector's Editions for 48-hour early access--for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Bethesda and Microsoft have dialed up the marketing for the game to celebrate its release, with other promotions focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-wireless-controller-game-bundle-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530902/">official Doom controllers</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-custom-doom-harley-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6531325/">very cool custom Doom Harley Davidson motorcycle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/order-this-doom-the-dark-ages-pizza-get-in-game-skin-and-a-game-pass-trial/1100-6531453/">Doom-inspired pizza</a> that comes with several digital goodies.</p>

Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Frogwares announced that it was working on The Sinking City Remastered back in March, but it didn’t indicate when it would be released. It made this announcement alongside news of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help fund the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>.

Revealed to a live audience at PAX East 2025 in Boston over the weekend, the trailer features a new look at gameplay and a quick glimpse at a boss fight against an armored Omen Beast bear named Bromius.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer also showcases the game’s combat, with clips of sword-based gameplay and Soulframe’s magick system. Unlike the ultra-fast combat of Warframe, which is not a part of the Soulframe universe despite a similar name, Soulframe slows things down a bit for a more deliberate action experience.

<p>This is the new Captain America and Black Panther game penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig, developed by Skydance Games.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">story trailer for Marvel 1943</a> from March 2024 gave us a look at the game in action, as shown at the State of Unreal livestream. "Working with the MetaHuman process, we have been able to honour our amazing actors' performances and faithfully transform them into equally powerful digital performances," Hennig said at the time of the new technology.</p>
<p>Then fresh details emerged at the end of last year, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">look at this game's version of Wakanda</a>.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," said Hennig, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra follows in the foosteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delayed from this year into next</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sony's Ghost of Yōtei</a> appears to be the biggest release at the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its financial report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company is doing very well indeed, bolstered by the major success of the latest entry in one of its biggest franchises.</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom celebrated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-record-profits" rel="nofollow">seventh straight year of record profits</a>, and according to the studio's latest results <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250513b.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summary</a>, it can now roll that figure over to eight, as both profits and net sales hit record highs this year.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, net sales jumped by 11.3% compared to last year, while operating income is up by 15.2%. As you'd probably expect if you've been following Capcom's progress this year, it's mainly&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>the studio has to thank for that success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=9SNbtu18 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=qv1tz4S- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has given Capcom its eighth straight year of record profits.</figcaption></figure><p>Released in February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player records</a> for Capcom at launch, hitting 1.2 million players within just a few hours of its release. The game went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million copies</a>&nbsp;within three days, hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">ten million mark</a> by the end of March.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>, Capcom says its performance this year was also helped by "strong catalog title sales" in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series across the board, suggesting that <em>Wilds</em><em>&nbsp;</em>also bolstered the sales for past entries like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>

<p>Although Capcom doesn't specifically mention it in the report, it's also important not to forget&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>; latest entry <i>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">broke the ten million sales mark last month</a>, and other entries in the franchise aren't doing too badly for Capcom either.</p>

<p>The company also credits its booming pachislo business, including units based on&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, with this aspect of the Japanese studio's operations enjoying "increasing unit sales volume".</p>

But it’s safe to say that the MIRO is a scientific space vessel dedicated, at least at one time, to exploring distant worlds. Now you find yourself alone on board, most of the doors locked, being given instructions by an unidentified voice and equipped with the ability to take a shuttle down to the surface of a range of different planets.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196742,195579" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Each planet is procedurally generated, including–it seems–the core storyline planets, populated by the most bizarre mixes of flora and fauna. Plants can often seem alien, but at other times look like Earthly deciduous trees. The animals, meanwhile, are all instantly recognisable, given they’re a bemusing mix of all manner of dinosaurs, rhinos, alligators, deer, bears, butterflies, komodo dragons, and many more. Why are so many Earth animals here? Why are so many of them from so many different points in history? And why are you stumbling upon abandoned buildings, long-broken satellite dishes, fallen-down bridges, and even ruined cities?</p><figure id="" data-id="48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-recommend-id="image://48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-recommend-id="image://48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, figuring all that out is the story, and it’s a neat one! Actually playing the game, however, is far more about exploration and the gathering of resources. Here, imagine a space-bound <em>Subnautica</em>, or given the cube-like nature of most resources, that replicator in <em>Prey</em>, where all the items you gather can be taken back to the MIRO, and then used by a machine to replicate new items, bandages, and most importantly, improvements to your suit and tools.</p><div><h4><strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Exploration on planets by foot is pretty slow work, especially given the enormous size of each explorable area, so getting a hoverbike working is pretty essential. That requires gathering enough of the right resources, and then figuring out combinations of them all in the Science Terminal to tweak everything to perfection. (Forget double-jump, I currently have sextuple-jump.) After a good few hours, I’m now flinging myself around the surfaces of planets with my bike, my jumping abilities, and my splendid grapple.</p><figure id="" data-id="46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-recommend-id="image://46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-recommend-id="image://46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What works so well here is that despite <em>MIRO </em>telling in many ways a narrative-led linear story, the way you play it is so extraordinarily open. I’ve often found myself deliberately landing on a new planet just so I can spend an hour roaming around, finding many of the key locations, hoovering up resources, and staring in astonishment at the size of a new species of dino, even though I had no core goals in mind. It’s relaxing, in the way that <em>NMS</em> used to be, plus I’m always grateful for the extra piles of useful stuff I return with. There is an ending, and it’s a satisfying conclusion to a good story, but don’t feel compelled to rush toward it.</p><p>I should say, I’ve had a fair few glitches. However, rather crucially, when I’ve reported progression-impeding bugs to developer Lost Saved Data_, it’s had a patched version up within hours.</p><figure id="" data-id="0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-recommend-id="image://0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-recommend-id="image://0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An open-world <em>Proteus</em> is quite the selling point on its own, but <em>Miro</em> is so much more with its story, crafting, and ever-more powerful means of perambulation. This is the work of three people, and it’s unquestionably crude around the edges. But I’ve had such a splendid time playing it, merrily wiling away hours just poking around on planets, even if it’s to meticulously open every cargo container in a large, abandoned storage facility out of sheer completism. With its proc-gen planets, every location looks different, and while the creatures are all pre-made, there’s so much variety that even by the end I was seeing animals I’d not encountered before.</p><p>Keep things in perspective: this obviously <em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It’s a small indie game with a far more limited scope, and a far greater desire to tell you an interesting tale. (There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a very generous demo</a></span>, too.) But it’s such a massive achievement, with a wonderful aesthetic (including excellent music), and it entirely entwined me in its compelling loops. I loved it.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miro <em>is out now on PC via Steam</em></a></span><em> for $15</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <em>The Studio</em>, <em>Adolescence</em>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-helly-mark-gemma-3-renewal-1851771662?_gl=1*1quc9d0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-helly-mark-gemma-3-renewal-1851771662?_gl=1*1quc9d0*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw"><em>Severance</em></a></span>,<em>  </em>Apple TV+ and Netflix have produced the year’s most talked-about shows, while series like <em>The Pitt</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682"><em>Paradise</em></a></span>, and <em>Dying For Sex</em> have turned medical disasters, governmental coups, and liberating orgasms some of the most compelling TV of the year. To have fully kept up with the best of the best on TV, the outside world would need to be an afterthought. But at least you’d be able to see Wilson Fisk  (Vincent D’Onofrio) break a man’s skull with his hands.</p><p>With so many great TV shows out in 2025, it can be tough to know where to start. These are the 14 you need to watch now if you haven’t already.</p></div></div><div><p>Every year in which  there’s a new season of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span>, it’s one of the best seasons of TV that year. This year, the dystopian anthology drama series explores the terrifying concepts of subscription services for consciousness, having your consciousness trapped in a video game, and more unsettling collisions of humanity and technology. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/issa-rae-black-mirror-hotel-reverie-bad-acting-1851776365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/issa-rae-black-mirror-hotel-reverie-bad-acting-1851776365">Issa Rae</a></span> delivers an all-time great performance as A-list actress Brandy Friday in the episode “Hotel Reverie,” in which she digitally enters black-and-white movie <em>Hotel Reverie</em> to recreate it with AI programming, only to develop a sentimental connection with her unreal co-star Dorothy (Emma Corrin) that rivals the fan-favorite romance of past <em>Black Mirror </em>episode “San Junipero.” Even though the world’s madness is starting to be stranger than what the show can produce, <em>Black Mirror</em> is still in a class of its own.</p></div><div><p>The most criminally underrated series of the last five years is Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker’s 1960s drama <em>Godfather of Harlem</em>. As drug kingpin and unofficial mayor of Harlem Bumpy Johnson, Whitaker delivers steely stoicism whether staring at a man shot dead or helping his daughter recover from heroin addiction. His captivating performance gives the show the type of verisimilitude that helps transport you to a time when street justice reigned supreme. In the fourth season, Whitaker’s attempt at legitimization hits a snag when the money flow can’t match his ambition for bettering Harlem, and his struggles between doing what’s right and doing what’s effective are a point of compelling tension. Outside of Bumpy Johnson, the show has a constellation of characters that could be the leads of their own  shows. Stella Gigante (Lucy Fry) is surreptitiously developing her own prowess in the criminal underworld, Elise Johnson (Antoinette Crowe-Legacy) gets involved with the Black Panther Party, and Vincent ‘Chin’ Gigante (Vincent D’Onofrio) is trying to maintain his place within the mob. <em>Godfather of Harlem</em> routinely delivers an all-star lineup of incredible actors, and season 4 is one of its best showings. </p></div><div><p><em>Hacks </em>always feels like that one friend you go to when you want to be smacked with the truth and then stunned by the  strangest joke you’ve ever heard right afterwards so the sting feels like a warm embrace. After three award-winning seasons of putting larger-than-life and colder-than-corpses comedian Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and woke prodigy Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder) in an odd couple relationship, the fourth season has them as enemies who must maintain a working relationship or face mutually assured destruction in the form of losing their opportunity at a late-night talk show. The genius of <em>Hacks </em>is in the way the show digs into a joke, seemingly to generate more laughs, only for you to realize it’s peeling back layers you didn’t know were there. For example, Ava engaging in a throuple creates humorous moments like her answering a work call during sex while the other two tend to each other, and being the butt of Deborah’s barrage of “three-way” jokes at dinner. Before you know it, the couple tells her she’s masking her emotionally unavailability as hypersexuality due to unresolved issues with her last breakup. From ageism battles to trauma bonds, <em>Hacks</em> is an incredible series.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-the-penguin-disney-marvel-1851749356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-the-penguin-disney-marvel-1851749356"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a></span> had a lot to live up to. As the first series about Matt Murdock’s costumed crimefighter since Netflix’s series <em>Daredevil </em>ended over six years ago, the Disney+ revival needed to either match or exceed the gritty realism and character depth of the original series. After nine episodes, <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>more than lives up to the hype. Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) is now the mayor of New York City while Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) struggles with his vigilante impulses that have sometimes had lethal consequences. The season started with the sudden and heartbreaking death of Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and ended with Fisk crushing the police commissioner’s skull with his bare hands in front of his rogue team of cops to establish he was taking over the city by force. At no point did <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> allow you to get comfortable with any sense of normalcy. Matt even jumps in front of a bullet to save Fisk’s life. It’s unquestionably one of the best first seasons in Disney+’s history.</p></div><div><p><em>Common Side Effects</em> is an animated series follows two former lab partners, Marshall Cuso (Dave King) and Frances Applewhite (Emily Pendergast), who discover a mushroom that can cure all diseases, so you can imagine the government cover-ups and Big Pharma conspiracies that  follow. In one scene, the show delves into medical suppression with a surreal “mushroom trip” in which Hildy (Sue Rose) consumes the blue angel mushroom to test its healing powers, only to have a vivid and disturbing vision of her head rapidly aging before exploding into bacteria repeatedly, symbolizing the mushroom’s overwhelming power to reverse death and decay. Through graphic surrealism like this, <em>Common Side Effects</em> unflinchingly explores the tension between the potential benefits of alternative medicine and the profit-centric healthcare. No show on TV in 2025 has been as daring with its messaging or delivery than <em>Common Side Effects</em>.</p></div><div><p>Season 1 of <em>Mo</em>, which focused on Mohammed “Mo” Najjar and his family, was the rare dramedy to tackle a Palestinian family’s displacement trauma, their experiences with cultural and religious differences in relationships, and the hustle of the American dream, all through the lens of strip club panic attacks and treating gunshot wounds with olive oil. The second season takes Mo’s experience as an undocumented immigrant and expands it without losing the homegrown humor. The show takes you inside the inhumane conditions of an ICE detention center where Mo hilariously shows resilience by singing a karaoke rendition of Hank Williams’ “Your Cheatin’ Heart” and, on top of everything else, must put up with a cellmate who inexplicably meows like a cat. The second season doesn’t sugarcoat the truth, especially the history of conflict between Israel and Palestine. But it does expertly show how true resistance involves not letting tragedy define you, and it does so with some of the best comedy writing of the year. </p></div><div><p>Death and sex normally don’t go together on television, but the FX dramedy miniseries finds a liberating place where they collide. After Molly Kochan (Michelle Williams) is diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, she leaves her sexless marriage in search of exploring her sexuality and finding lost parts of herself. As Molly has hilarious sex romps in hospital beds and encounters requests for a kick in the dick while she confronts sexual trauma from her childhood, her best friend Nikki Boyer (Jenny Slate) deals with the guilt of feeling overburdened by taking care of her dying friend. The show is grounded in a true story and presents a remarkably honest look at how the end can be a gateway to a new beginning, even if that includes dildo shopping and orgasms.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501"><em> Andor</em> Season 2</a></span> is a satisfying slow burn that frequently erupts into some of the best television viewing around. At times it rivals HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> in its Machiavellian scheming and gripping character portraits, while also leaning into the best parts of <em>Star Wars</em> lore and fan service without over indulging. Its set-piece peaks are even higher than the best action moments of season 1 while still managing to tunnel deeper into the compelling human dramas that imbue the formation of the Rebel Alliance with meaning and emotion. You could strip away all of the red blaster fire and Wookiepedia name-dropping and <em>Andor</em> would still be a world-class TV thriller worthy of everyone’s time. —Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you’d told me last year that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-gillian-jacobs-eve-interview-1851756259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-gillian-jacobs-eve-interview-1851756259"><em>Invincible </em></a></span>would deliver some of the most emotionally complex character developments of any TV show so far in 2025, I would’ve thought you were one of those brainwashed ReAnimen. But it’s true. After a subpar second season that largely felt like a setup for this third one, Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) wrestles with the morality of murder, his half-brother Oliver (Lincoln Bodin) exhibits the same homicidal pragmatism as their exiled father Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons), and Cecil (Walton Goggins) blurs the lines of right and wrong by enlisting rehabilitated criminals as protectors of society. And that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s not forget that the last two episodes of the season feature an epic war between evil Invincibles from across the multiverse, as well as the good Invincible and Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) engaging in a staggeringly brutal fight. Through it all, Conquest drops shockingly profound quips like “I don’t even get a real name, only a purpose” and says “there is no greater pleasure than feeling the warmth of my fists drenched in blood,” making him the villain who most effectively combines wit and bloodshed since Thanos.</p></div><div><p><em>Paradise </em>turned Sterling K. Brown from America’s dad on <em>This Is Us </em>into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Hollywood’s latest badass</a></span> as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins by having him lead a paramilitary coup against the fascist government of a city built inside of a Colorado mountain. Brown’s ability to go from doting father to fierce protector to disgruntled employee while exhibiting the same dutiful passion for doing what he feels is right helps the series transcend some of the one-dimensional pitfalls of most post-apocalyptic shows. But it also helps that <em>Paradise </em>intricately examines how the titular city is formed, from the hierarchical selection of its residents to the artificial ways they recreate normal life, all so well-developed and thought through that they make this world feel lived-in and fun to explore. </p><p>Brown isn’t alone. Julianne Nicholson plays Samantha “Sinatra” Redmond, chief decision-maker and mastermind of the mountainous bunker, as a woman who funnels her grief over her son dying  into her efforts to exert total control over the world around her in order to prevent ever having to experience anything like that again. Such character nuances are pervasive throughout the show. Also the penultimate episode, in which Collins has to forcibly get the President of the United States out of the White House through a mob of governmental officials who just found out the world is ending, is not only one of the best TV episodes of 2025. It’s one of the best episodes in Hulu’s history. </p></div><div><p>At this point, if you see Noah Wyle in a Chicago emergency room, either hand him lidocaine or hand him an Emmy. The <em>ER</em> legend is leading a fresh group of doctors and nurses through an eventful and exhausting 15-hour shift during which disgruntled patients assault nurses, a mass shooting happens at a music festival, there’s a car chase involving a stolen ambulance vehicle, and Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones) dishes enough dry humor  to rub anyone the wrong way. What makes <em>The Pitt </em>special is that nothing happens yet everything happens. Since each episode is one hour of the 15-hour shift, there is no central plot point that is wrapped up by the end of each episode. That, paired with the type of immersive camera work that made <em>ER </em>great, makes each episode an unflinching look at the many different human experiences that can fit into one hour in an emergency room.</p><p><em>The Pitt</em> eschews distracting medical drama tropes. There are no make-out sessions in Exam Room 1, or jokes that last beyond a chuckle. There’s no holiday-themed episode in which Christmas cheer makes the doctors forget there’s a terminally ill patient wasting away in triage. <em>The Pitt</em> is a beautifully self-contained drama that can break your heart more times in one hour than the best shows can in an entire season. </p></div><div><p>Honestly, <em>The Studio </em>shouldn’t work this well. A comedy series about the hijinks and chaos of running a movie studio should only be appealing to industry insiders and those who have read one too many <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> op-eds. Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, the new head of Continental Studios, and transforms this show into the best comedy of 2025 so far by satirizing annoying industry trends and the ways in which famous people can be obsessive  about made-up stories. In the real world, someone turned Winnie the Pooh into the star of a bloody slasher film, hoping to capitalize on our collective fixation with legacy IP; <em>The Studio </em>spoofs such things by having Remick try to convince Martin Scorsese to turn a film about the Jonestown cult mass murder of 1978 into one about the Kool-Aid brand. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde shows up, spoofing the real-life scandal about her directorial work on <em>Don’t Worry Darling </em>by playing a manic version of herself who would steel reels of scenes she wants to reshoot. And those are just a few episodes.</p><p>The supporting cast of Kathryn Hahn, Bryan Cranston, Ike Barinholtz, Catherine O’Hara, and Chase Sui Wonders (in what could be her breakout role) are sensational. But it’s Remick’s earnest love of cinema that adds a level of profundity to the comedy. In one episode, he becomes enraged when a group of doctors dismiss his career as less important than theirs because Remick honestly believes movies can improve people’s lives. In that way, <em>The Studio </em>is a love letter to films during a time when the medium’s importance outside of cell phones and TVs is being questioned. </p></div><div><p>After its second season, Apple TV+’s cultural phenomenon <em>Severance</em> has reached a point where its so inseparable from the world (and mystery) it has created that you either love the show or never want to watch another episode again. The sci-fi workplace drama about the consequences of compartmentalizing the human experience took the first season’s look at the machinations behind splitting people’s consciousnesses in two and expanded it outwards to truly look at the issues raised by its core concept on a macro scale. The first season made us believe the Innies and the Outies were two halves of the same person. The second season beautifully illustrates how we’ve been falling in love with people who are diametrically opposed to parts of themselves as a means of survival.</p><p>That’s the brilliance of <em>Severance</em>. On the surface it’s a never-ending search for clues about what exactly Lumon is doing with these severed workers, and why the hell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787?_gl=1*ikj6tm*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNzQzNjIkbzkwJGcxJHQxNzQ3MDc0NTMyJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787?_gl=1*ikj6tm*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNzQzNjIkbzkwJGcxJHQxNzQ3MDc0NTMyJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">there’s a fucking child working there</a></span>. But, it’s through this extreme and fantastical lens that we’re able to explore how identity is as important as air, and love transcends all even in the most improbable circumstances. Britt Lower conveys more emotions in slight facial twitches as Helly R/Helena Eagan than some of the best actresses can do in full scenes. Tramell Tillman is the runaway pick for every Best Supporting Actor award for his scene-stealing realism (and unmatched dance moves) as Lumon shill Seth Milchick. And this might truly be the best role of Adam Scott’s career. </p><p>Don’t try to figure out <em>Severance</em>. Just enjoy the ride. </p></div><div><p>It wasn’t until midway through the first episode, when shock-riddled 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) goes through the emotionless procedure of being arrested after having his world rocked, that I realized the entire episode has been one long, continuous shot. The delay in my recognition of this fact wasn’t due to viewing passively as I lazily scrolled on a second screen. It was because, at its best, <em>Adolescence </em>gets a stranglehold on your attention with its drama, to the point that you’re only focused on what happens next rather than how it’s being presented. The Netflix drama focuses on a troubled teenage boy accused of killing his classmate Katie Leonard (Emilia Holliday), and the multi-layered ramifications that has on a family, a police force, and a school. That’s where the one-shot approach becomes essential.</p><p>Most shows take a fragmented approach to offering up the perspectives of different characters on the inciting incident that puts the season in motion. In one episode of such a show, you may get 10 different perspectives that all come into focus by the end of the season. On <em>Adolescence</em>, you spend an entire episode with Jamie and his psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty), from her entering the facility to the two of them playing a game of chess to them having a session to her sitting in the shocked aftermath of seeing a young boy riddled with volatile self-hate. All of that, without the camera blinking or allowing you to divert from the drama that was unfolding. Also, that episode is on the shortlist of best episodes in Netflix’s history. </p><p>When all is said and done, no TV show so far this year has been nearly as impressive or emotionally arresting as <em>Adolescence</em>. And I’m not sure one will be. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney apparently attended a high-profile lunch today, May 13, in Saudi Arabia with US President Donald Trump and other world and business leaders from across the globe.</p><p>This is according to a list of attendees supplied by the White House and <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1922207622670802974?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared by reporter Kaitlan Collins.</a> Some of the other attendees include Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller, just to name a few.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was said to have attended the lunch as well. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/13/us/trump-news-saudi-arabia" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reported</a> that the high-profile executives might have been there to make business deals or lobby Trump and his own officials on tariffs and trade policies in general.</p><p>Sweeney was the only video game executive on the list of attendees, though. Saudi Arabi's Public Investment Fund has invested tens of billions into the gaming market in recent years, which has prompted some concern from people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/" data-ref-id="1100-6504587">dismayed by the nation's human rights history.</a></p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Epic Games in an attempt to get more details on Sweeney's reported involvement in this lunch.</p><p>For its part, Chinese internet behemoth Tencent is a minority investor in the company. In 2024, two directors at Epic who had been appointed by Tencent <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">resigned from the Epic board</a> following a US government investigation.</p><p>Sweeney's Epic Games recently scored a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">key victory in its fight against Apple</a>, but Fortnite hasn't yet returned to the App Store.
