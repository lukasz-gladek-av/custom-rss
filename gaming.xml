              <p>The mascot for late-stage capitalism is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcfav-5kArM">that final orgy scene in horror classic <em>Society</em></a>. (Do not click on that YouTube link in any circumstances, ever.) Everything consuming everything else until all that’s left is one monstrous behemoth of hideous depravity. So, moments after Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance for just one $16 million bribe and <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">the head of Stephen Colbert</a>, the resulting mutilation is trying to come for Warner Bros. Discovery. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach">according to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em></a>&nbsp; its first attempt has been rebuffed for being too low of a bid.</p> <p>Among a great deal else, Warner Bros. owns all of DC, including its movies, TV shows and comics, and the many video game spin-offs including the&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em> Batman games. Then it has everything&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts</em>, as well as all of the enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games. Which is to say, along with being a massive movie studio and streamer (it also owns HBO), it’s a very significant player in the world of video games.</p>

 <p>Word began spreading that Paramount was circling the movie, TV and video game studio a while back, with&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/david-zaslav-warner-bros-purchase-paramount-david-ellison-1236575377/"><em>Deadline</em> reporting last week</a> that the plan was to swoop in and pick up the entire media corporation before current Warner boss David Zaslav splits the company in half. Motivated by the Trump-controlled FCC’s allowance of the merger with Skydance, Paramount seems to believe it can bypass concerns of monopolies once more and take over Bugs Bunny’s business in just six months. But it seems the first approach hasn’t been good enough for Zaslav.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, an offer of $20 per share was made in recent weeks, which Warner didn’t consider high enough.&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>‘s reporting says that Zaslav is looking for $30 a share, while claiming it had heard Paramount boss David Ellison was offering $22-$24. If&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em> is correct, it seems the money people came in even lower, testing how desperate Zaslav is to sell. And, if you’re interested, the shares are currently valued at $17.10, making Warner Bros. Discovery worth $42.3 billion, but also carrying a ton of debt. Apparently Paramount’s $17 shares make <em>it&nbsp;</em>worth only $18.6 billion. How can one buy the other, you ask? Because money isn’t real, and big businesses can fudge any old shite they want.</p>

 <p>It seems Zaslav really wants to split the company, separating it into a (surely doomed) cable TV company (that you just have to imagine will magically take on so much of the debt), and a streaming and studios company. So, I guess, when the former fails the debt goes away? Is that how it works? It seems too horribly likely that that’s how it works. Then, without the old-world cable TV anvil strapped around its neck, it’d make the remaining company a lot more likely to be more highly valued in a buy-out.</p> <p>Presumably Paramount won’t give up, with future approaches likely to include upping its offer or going directly to shareholders—this is very likely just a first, exploratory poke of the ant nest. And soon, everything will be owned by one giant corporation to which we will forcibly pledge our allegiance and worship every Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s Campaign offers players an ‘Uninstall’ button once they have finished it. </p>



<p>EA’s highly sought-after FPS title, Battlefield 6, has finally been released, and it is already dominating the Steam charts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing</a> Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count within a day of launch. Now, new details about the BF6’s campaign have been revealed, and it seems that this game mode provides players with an option to ‘uninstall’. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-campaign-can-be-easily-uninstalled-once-completed">Battlefield 6 Campaign Can be Easily Uninstalled Once Completed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-ea-electronic-arts-campaign-hdd-space-uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, a post by BobNetworkUK on <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1977095756193710437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals that the Battlefield 6 Campaign screen will replace the usual button with an uninstall button once the player has completed the game mode. The original poster stated that players can continue playing and completing challenges if they don’t want to uninstall the mode, as it still features mission select. Still, many players might be happy to be offered that option once this game mode has been completed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding Battlefield 6’s campaign, we know it features nine missions spanning three continents: Africa, North America, and Europe. The game mode also lets players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-lets-players-command-a-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">command a full squad</a> at almost all times, with each member belonging to a different class. Moreover, the revive system works similarly to multiplayer: if a player has been downed, a squad member can revive them, and vice versa.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers have confirmed that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not feature generative AI</a>. Additionally, the open beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intentionally had smaller maps</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6’s campaign telling you to uninstall the mode once completed?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1976774165207060716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1976774165207060716%7Ctwgr%5E189fd63311bfa1ba40ae994f5c95a230fe717dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Fglen-powell-wants-a-part-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-movie-1616433%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> during this weekend's New York Comic-Con 2025, Hollywood star Glen Powell revealed that he has been playing (and enjoying) Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a lot lately, and he'd like to be in the movie, too.</p>



<p><em>Expedition 33 is one of that I've become a fan of. If there's an Expedition 33 movie, I'd be very interested.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear whether Glen Powell is aware that a live action adaptation of the game was announced in January 2025, before the game's launch (which happened on April 24). The film will be produced by Story Kitchen, formerly known as dj2 Entertainment, a production company focused specifically on adapting game IPs. They already have experience with the successful Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and also have signed deals to bring many other franchises to the big and small screen, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, Sifu, and Vampire Survivors.</p>



<p>Casting for the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 movie is yet to be announced. Of course, Glen Powell would be a big get. Following his roles in Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man, Anyone but You, Twisters, and Chad Powers, Powell is now one of the top leading actors in Hollywood. His next appearances will be in The Running Man, an Edgar Wright-directed film adapted from the 1982 dystopian novel by Stephen King, and Ghostwriter, J.J. Abrams' next fantasy movie.</p>



<p>Can Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive afford him, though? Sure, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has surpassed five million copies sold, which is certainly much more than they were expecting. </p>



<p>At any rate, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-future-update-to-add-new-location-costumes-and-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are preparing a free update</a> that will add new late game bosses and a brand new location to explore to the game. This will be a thank-you for the whole community.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> was one of a number of games Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">tossed in the bin</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs earlier this year</a>. It was disappointing, if not a huge surprise given how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">protracted Everwild's development had been</a> up until its demise, with lots of questions remaining as to what the mysterious ramble through nature would be like to play.</p>
<p>Now, some leaked screenshots might offer a bit more of an idea as to some of the stuff you'd have been able to get up to in between patting various creatures and swinging a staff around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The screens, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details">mp1st</a>, offer a look at the game's interfaces and menus. The site report they've come from an artist's website and are from a version of the game that existed not long before Microsoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>
<p>One sees the player character standing with their inventory open, with their pockets boasting tools, plants, seeds, mosaics, and figments. It's the latter that's caught my attention, as they look to be cute little plant creatures. Given the farm or base building-esque feel of the menu, might these figments have been pint-sized helpers with your gardening ventures? Sadly, we won't know until someone from Rare chats about the game.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="es"><p>Se han publicado screenshots del cancelado <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Everwild?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Everwild</a> a través de un artista que estuvo en <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rare</a> para el proyecto.</p><p>De acuerdo a lo informado a MP1ST, estas imágenes serían de una versión del juego bastante cercana a su cancelación en Junio de este año. <a href="https://t.co/FN9ci0VOMn">pic.twitter.com/FN9ci0VOMn</a></p></div>— Soul Gizzmo (@SoulGizzmo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulGizzmo/status/1977514481581273449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>A couple of other screens show the character standing by a patch of grass ringed by an overgrown path. Twinned with the statue and columns you can make out in some of the shots, some exploration or uncovering of old ruins or temples looks possible. Such a thing would match the druidy vibes of Everwild's trailers, and it'd make sense if the group of eternals the player belonged to were an ancient sect or culture you'd learn more about by exploring their former abodes. Or perhaps you'd be tasked with exploring the old homes of another civilisation who in some way messed up the rhythm of nature and paid for it.</p>
<p>A couple of the screens are also very blurry, so maybe you'd find a camera in these ruins and be physically unable to work out how to use the focus, because you're far too focused on helping some salamander thing gently vomit what I assume to be its kids into a river. That last thing happens in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSWnnQMSPjc&amp;t=126s">this trailer</a> at around the 1:15 mark, lest you accuse me of ruining your day with made up tales of water-based creatures blowing chunks.</p>
<p>It's sad that this and dev testimonies are how Everwild's mysteries'll be uncovered, rather than by folks who've fired up a complete game, but such is the nature of projects which never see the light of day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucials-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb-2000634496</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crucial%E2%80%99s-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb.1323433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s rare that a tech deal approaches perfection as closely as this one that’s just popped up at Amazon. That might sound hyperbolic, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">but how else would you describe this all-time low price on the Crucial X10 4TB SSD,</a> which is one of the most complete portable drives in terms of physical size (tiny and lightweight), memory (huge), and speed (blazing)?</p>
<p>Amazon’s dropped the price on this all-star portable hard drive by 39% to an unprecedented $240. The Crucial X10’s appeal is multiplied when you take into account that it’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, Linux, and gaming consoles. Need more? It’s also IP65 dust and water resistant, and probably most importantly of all considering it’s modest size, the Crucial X10 is also drop-resistant up to nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Something for Everyone</h2>
<p>When a portable SSD has nearly universal compatibility to go along with all of its many outstanding features, it also gains nearly universal appeal. Creative professionals like photo and video shooters and editors love the massive 4TB capacity, but they might love the truly outstanding 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds that blast through even the biggest files in no time flat. The size and speed also make it a perfect source of extra storage for gaming consoles, and anyone just looking for a big, fast, reliable drive that will keep everything backed up and won’t take over their desk space will be thrilled by the Crucial X10.</p>
<p>Who else is this drive designed for? Students, for sure, since it’s big enough to keep all of those important files backed up and safe while also taking up next to no backpack space. Families with thousands of irreplaceable digital photos and home videos can fit all of them in the generous 4TB capacity of the Crucial X10 to keep them safe. The better question is, who isn’t the Crucial X10 designed for?</p>



<h2>Deal Become Steal</h2>
<p>While you’re more than welcome to keep the Crucial X10 on your desk fulltime, or keep it in a drawer to pull out for regular backups, it’s practically begging to be taken on the go.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> chief Randy Pitchford has said that if other developers better understood why gamers love making decisions about loot, Gearbox would have “good competitors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford was speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m7sd7y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> to discuss the release of Borderlands 4 and Gearbox’s journey alongside the series’ success. The outspoken developer said that even though the Borderlands franchise will break through 100 million units sold with Borderlands 4 (publisher 2K Games has yet to announce a sales figure), he insisted “we suck!” because that 100 million is but a drop in the ocean that is the total number of potential gamers globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our mission is to entertain the world,” Pitchford said. “Which means we suck! Because there are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. Borderlands, with 4, we’re gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That’s awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we’re just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been working on Borderlands for over 20 years now. And it feels like we’re starting to get pretty good at it. It feels like we’re starting to figure it out. I feel like we’ve probed a lot of the end points. But I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of a journey.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/gettyimages-2165642737-1760354699644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has thoughts about the looter shooter genre. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford then entered into a rather philosophical debate about why people love looter shooters like Borderlands so much. This is a game that revolves around the hunt for better loot — in the case of Borderlands 4 billions of potential weapons are available — and players fuss over whether to equip something new that’s just dropped or stick with what they already have, even if it’s inferior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a constant loop in the Borderlands games, which are packed with enemies, crates, chests, and even toilets that spit out loot. Perhaps to a greater extent than any other looter shooter, loot is everywhere in Borderlands, and the player is constantly having to pause to wonder, is that item that just dropped worth my time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, the answer is no. But sometimes the answer is yes. Either way, as you play Borderlands and fuss over the minutiae of your build, you're always asking yourself whether this item or that item will help make the numbers go up within your playstyle. Farming for these items is all part of the loot hunt and, for so many millions of fans, the whole reason to play Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Coincidentally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands games are tuned to present these sorts of loot conundrums “by design,” Pitchford explained, before saying he expected the franchise to have more imitators by now because of how addictive this loop is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re poking at some fundamentals, which is part of why I think Borderlands as a game has worked, and does work, and why it’s a very delicate design that I think is one of the reasons why there haven’t really been many successful imitators since we first showed how a shooter looter could work with the original game,” Pitchford said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands doesn’t have the looter shooter genre to itself, of course. Perhaps its most high-profile rival is Bungie’s Destiny, although that Sony-owned franchise has seen better days. Other examples include People Can Fly’s Outriders (no sequel in sight), and Ubisoft’s The Division (The Division 3 is in the works). If we’re stretching the definition of looter shooter, we might include games like Warframe, Remnant 2, or The First Descendant. Rocksteady’s disastrous Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is perhaps the most high-profile of looter shooter failures. Certainly, Borderlands and its various entries dominate the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it all comes down to nailing the “gratifying” decision around loot in Borderlands. It is something, Pitchford said, humans love to do because it scratches an itch in our brains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That decision, that choice about, do I keep what I have or do I try the new thing? That is a very compelling, fundamental, both need and skill that our brains have, to make choices like that,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve reduced it down to this simple moment with this interface in this system. It’s a gratifying loop. It’s a gratifying decision. Our brains need to do it, and our brains like doing it. And we’re better off when we do it. The more we exercise that muscle, not just in the video game but literally in life — this is what separates our species from a lot of others, and how we developed language and how we developed all kinds of high levels of consciousness and cognition that allow us to analyse the world. Most of what our prefrontal cortex is for — why that adaptation exists and what it’s used for — is that skill, or versions of it. We’ve reduced it down into this design. And yes — the is the thing I’m looking at better than the thing I’ve got, and managing the cognition between the objective, almost scientific analysis of that choice, versus the emotional impact on that choice, and having those at odds with each other frequently, is very interesting, and dare I say it addictive.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford continued: “We don’t do it because it’s addictive. We do it because it’s stimulating and because we kind of need that. Part of why games exist are to… yeah. we can live a fantasy that we might not be able to have in the real world, and we can explore themes and ideas in a safe place that we can’t explore in the real world, but we also can, because it’s an interactive simulation, we can test our thinking and our decision making and put our brain to work in really interesting ways that we kind of need and want.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the puzzlement that other developers haven’t taken Borderlands on at its own game, and the associated suggestion that Gearbox’s rivals aren’t thinking about the looter shooter on the same level as the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we’d have more competitors, or we’d have good competitors,” he said. “But we haven’t so far. It’s weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they’re not thinking about it on that level. They’re just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It’s not a designer’s or creator’s drive that’s doing it. It’s either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you’re not kind of drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s so weird. I fully expected after the first game came out that everyone would be hip to exactly what you mentioned, and we’d immediately see lots of other games imitating and aping, and we’d be dead, because we can’t compete with a lot of other folks, especially back then. We were the scrappy underdogs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the critical reception to Borderlands 4 suggests Gearbox has once again successfully presented a looter shooter that ticks all the right boxes. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dataminer-unearths-evidence-to-suggest-a-much-maligned-borderlands-3-character-was-cut-and-replaced-late-in-development"><u>a Borderlands 4 dataminer unearthed evidence to suggest that one of the most hated characters from Borderlands 3 was cut and replaced relatively late in development</u></a>. 2K Games and Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

I’d also say we don’t see a great number of five-color preconstructed decks, but we’re literally getting one in Lorwyn Eclipsed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four turtles, plus Splinter?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> gives its revenge-seeking protagonist Atsu a wide range of traditional Japanese weapons to wield, including bows, swords and spears. Last week, however, a Japanese-speaking user on X questioned whether it was realistic or even possible for Atsu to draw a very long sword from her back, prompting a flood of video comments from traditional Japanese martial arts practitioners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ghost of Yotei, you’ll pick up the Odachi (literally ‘big sword’) in The Way of the Odachi quest (check out our walkthrough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ghost-of-yotei/The_Way_of_the_Odachi_Walkthrough"><u>here</u></a>). It is a useful addition to Atsu’s arsenal, especially when facing off against larger enemies (brutes). It allows her to block heavy attacks and then push back against the opponent, opening them up for a devastating slice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she already has two swords at her hip, Atsu opts to sheath the Odachi on her back, however X user ikazombie questioned how on earth you’d pull this off without dislocating something. Upon slowing the clip down, they realised that you could theoretically draw and sheath it from over your left shoulder, but seemed unconvinced about how this would be accomplished in real life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">大太刀、あんなデカい刀を背負ってどうやって抜刀すんねん関節外れるぞと思ってたんだけど、予想外のモーションで ” 理 論 上 は ” 問題なく抜刀/納刀できてたの笑う<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/j31VjGpgDk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j31VjGpgDk</a></p>— ジェット・リョー (@ikazombie) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikazombie/status/1974771283360645536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese martial arts practitioners commented with videos. User Harima_mekkai (a member of the Tenshinryu school) decided to try out Atsu’s way of wearing and drawing an Odachi. She posted a video of herself successfully unsheathing a 1m long sword weighing 1.5kg from over her left shoulder. This shows that the drawing part of Atsu's Odachi technique is actually doable, albeit it takes effort and training to pull it off that smoothly.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— まーこ　11月29日生誕祭🎂 (@harima_mekkai) <a href="https://twitter.com/harima_mekkai/status/1975527448180891946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another user by the name of Lornplum replied with a video of himself drawing and sheathing a back-mounted sword and described the way Atsu deals with the length by holding the blade as she draws it as a "brilliant touch of realism." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">刀身持って長さを稼ぐやり方としては絶妙なリアリティ<br>現実でやるならこういうかんじ<a href="https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq</a></p>— lornplum (@lornplum) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornplum/status/1974791334272921826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch did get members of the Tenshinryu school to do motion capture for the sword fights and stances in Ghost of Yotei. Tenshinryu is a traditional Japanese martial art which dates from the 1600s and covers the art of a wide variety of weapons, including spears, swords and chain sickles. PlayStation Japan recently posted a side-by-side video of Ghost of Yotei footage and Tenshinryu members enacting the fight scene.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— プレイステーション公式 (@PlayStation_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation_jp/status/1976269162147422445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is still a bit of video game coolness trumping realism here. The clips of real-life pros show them moving the sheath up and over their shoulder more (or even <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1974797905312813146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>around their body</u></a>) to make it easier to draw and sheath the weapon. This is especially apparent when sheathing the sword. It seems that the amount of movement in Atsu’s Odaichi sheathing was reduced, likely to make whipping out and holstering the weapon smoother and more responsive for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Lornplum <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1975554349884690691" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented </u></a>on Harima_Mekkai’s demonstration of drawing a Odaichi Atsu-style: “As you can see, with some effort anyone can manage to draw it, however sheathing it (like Atsu does) is pretty much impossible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they look cool in games, it goes without saying that having a sword on your back in real life makes it much more awkward to access than if it was at your hip. Last year, a Link cosplayer found it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-helps-zelda-cosplayer-struggling-to-unsheathe-links-sword-by-explaining-how-it-works-in-smash-bros"><u>impossible to unsheath their back-mounted sword</u></a> Breath of the Wild-style.

            <p>Alright readers, here’s the bad news: the Maw ate Edwin. I know, it’s unfortunate, but we all saw it coming. You can’t feed a Stygian horror nothing but PC game releases and expect it to simply forget about protein. The <em>good</em> news is that the Maw isn’t a particularly thorough masticator, so I imagine Edwin will have clambered back out by, ooh, say, Wednesday. Like that episode of the Samurai Jack reboot, except he spends even more time in a loincloth.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>No field battle-sized megagames this week, but there is another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> launching later today, Monday 13th October. That means demos: free demos, loads of demos, far too many demos, dear God how did you people make so many demos. Who’s got a game they’re hoping to see demo-fied? I continue waiting in quiet, some might say blind hope that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> emerges from its years of silence. But we’ll see.</p>
<h2>Monday 13th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891020/Undusted_Letters_from_the_Past/">Undusted: Letters from the Past</a> is a breezy object restoration game in which you polish, scrub, and mini-vacuum old tat to learn the stories of its owners.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386750/Spindle/">Spindle</a>, a pixelly action-adventure, casts you as Death in a world where nobody’s dying. That leaves plenty of time to go fishing and tend to your pet pig, mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 14th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Mohrta</a> is a free-roaming fantasy FPS with an abundance of Morrowind-y weirdness.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527820/Chickenhare_and_the_treasure_of_SpikingBeard/">Chickenhare and the Treasure of Spiking-Beard</a> is clearly going for 2000’s 3D platformer charm, and looks family-friendly almost to a fault.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 15th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/">Ball X Pit</a> would like one of every genre, please. It’s a Breakout-influenced survival schmup (with, to be fair, amusingly chaotic bouncy-ball projectiles) that ties in base-building and is, of course, a roguelike.</li>
<li>Anarchic comedy adventure<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/"> GlitchSPANKR</a> seems a bit loud for me, though I support more developers making Jazzpunk-style jokefests.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1830320/Lords_of_Ravage/">Lords of Ravage</a> has you playing the baddie, namely a commander of mishmashed monster units you’ll be pitting against heroes in turn-based battles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 16th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, a co-operative fantasy dungeon raider (sans MMO grinding), launches into early access.</li>
<li>Quacking parody <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape from Duckov</a> replaces Tarkov’s extraction shooting and gross imperial undercurrents with silly vibes and twin-stick-style, purely PvE action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 17th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2852760/This_Is_No_Cave/">This Is No Cave</a>. Then what is it? A single-button, high-speed grapply platformer, apparently.</li>
<li>Double Fine’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043580/Keeper/">Keeper</a> lets you play – finally – as a lighthouse with legs. Looks a bit linear, but previews suggest this has some pretty clever puzzling, often involving the scraggly bird who’s perched atop your bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d say this was a quiet week before we somehow get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> all within a two-day window, but there’s no such thing as a quiet Next Fest week. It’s just... Christ, demos. <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s two-day sales even Prime Big Deals Days just ended. On October 7 and October, you could find crazy good deals all across the giant online retailer’s website covering pretty much every category of products. Even though the even is over, you can still find a ton of great opportunities to save. If you’re a photographer or videographer, you can elevate their game when shooting with a gimbal stabilizer. This RS 3 Mini 3-axis gimbal from DJI is still on sale past Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4727/"> It’s normally listed tat $237, but right now Amazon has it cut down by 20%. That shaves off $48, bring what you pay down to just $189.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wide-Ranging Compatibility</h2>
<p>This isn’t a gimbal designed for use with phones. This is professional-grade gear made with shooting on a DSLR camera in mind. With its strong high-torque motors, the DJI RS 3 Mini can support a load capacity of up to 4.4 lbs. (or 2kg). It works with a number of Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, and Fujifilm cameras. Check out the product page for the full list of models to see if your specific camera is compatible.</p>
<p>The gimbal implements a pro-level RS stabilization algorithm to keep your shot from shakings even when shooting at low angles or when filming in flashlight mode. It supports native vertical shooting, great for when creating content to be used on social media. The quick-release plate can just be set to the vertical arm and you’re good to go.</p>



<p>The handle on the DJI RS 3 Mini gimbal stabilizer has a number of controls built into the handle including a Bluetooth shutter control. Once you’ve paired it the first time, your camera will automatically connect when both are one and close by. From there, you can easily control photo capture, video recording, and even zoom right from the gimbal controls.</p>
<p>Designed to be portable, the stabilizer is light and small so you can easily store it into you bag. The whole gimbal only weighs 1.75 lbs. (or 795g).</p>
<p>Battery life is long-lasting. You’ll get a full 10 hours of shooting done off a single charge. When reaches 0%, you can get it back up to full after just 2.5 hours of charging.</p>
<p>Included with the gimbal, you receive a couple of mounting screws, a USB-charging cable, an L-shaped Multi-camera control cable (USB-C), the RS mini quick release plate, and an RS mini tripod. The last one can be screwed into the bottom of the gimbal for when you need a stationary shot.</p>

            <p>Black Myth Wukong is getting an update today, 13th October, across all platforms. It's a relatively minor update that fixes bugs and introduces some performance optimisations, but it requires so much space on PlayStation 5 that some players might struggle to install it.</p>
<p>You'll need approximately 93.5GB of free storage space for the update on PS5. As <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1977192496716517644">the Black Myth X account</a> explains: "Due to differences in file storage methods, the patch on PS5 will require a relatively large amount of space (approximately 93.5 GB)."</p>

<p>Given that the original game already occupies ~130GB of storage, adding another ~90GB gives a total of 210GB, which is a sizable chunk of an 825GB standard PS5 storage drive (especially when you consider there's about 667GB of working storage after system files are installed). If you struggle to find the space, it might be simpler to delete the entire game and redownload it.</p>
<p>"If the update cannot be completed due to insufficient storage or other reasons, you may continue playing the current version or try deleting the game and redownloading it," said the Black Myth X account.</p>
<p>Why would that work? Because you're not getting 90GB's worth of new content, you're likely redownloading a reordered file structure of the game - redownloading the game, effectively. Better to do it in one 93.5GB lump than doubling up, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Incidentally, PC players, note your mods - this patch might cause some compatibility issues with them. If it does, uninstall the mods and wait for them to be separately updated.</p>

<p>Black Myth Wukong was a huge success for maker Game Science when it launched last year, selling more than 10m copies despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">lukewarm reviews</a>. But more than that, it was a success for Chinese-made games. It seems to be to them what The Witcher was for Polish games: a pace-maker, a trend-setter, an attention- grabber, as Ed found out when he investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the rise of Chinese-made blockbuster games</a> recently.</p><p>Naturally, the game's success has also fuelled development of more Black Myth game experiences at Game Science, though we're not getting a direct sequel but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a thematic continuation based around another mythical Chinese figure, Zhong Kui</a>. There's no release date for it yet.</p>

<p>Well here's something that we weren't expecting. Fresh out of New York Comic Con 2025, we got our first peek at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/avatar-legends-the-fighting-game">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</a> (working title), an upcoming one-on-one fighter heading to Switch 2 in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't know all that much about what this one will have in store just yet — heck, the title will almost certainly change in the next 12 months — but the pre-alpha footage is looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Avatar Legends will see a roster of fighters from the immensely popular <strong>Last Airbender</strong> and <strong>Legend of Korra</strong> series face off in the ring. We can expect a good bit of elemental combat to keep things feeling fresh, and there's set to be a line-up of support characters for an extra pinch of customisation.</p>
<p>Throw in a single player campaign for good measure, and wrap it all up in a hand-drawn visual style reminiscent of the original anime, and we've got a pretty interesting looking fighter on our hands.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 12 Playable Characters at launch, with many more released via Season Model<br>
- Selectable support characters influence your fighting style and grant special moves<br>
- Unique “Flow System” w/Movement Centric Gameplay<br>
- Single Player Campaign w/Original Narrative<br>
- Combo TrialsGallery Mode<br>
- Best in Class Net Code and Cross Play</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still a lot more for us to learn about this one in the coming months, but the promise of a Switch 2 release has us intrigued.</p>

<p>It's pretty much why you think</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0e189b19842ec"><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e189b19842ec/sonic-racing-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is out now on the Switch, but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-racing-crossworlds">sub-optimal performance</a>, many fans are eagerly awaiting its eventual release on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/why-sonic-racing-crossworlds-is-delayed-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Traxion</a>, series producer Takashi Iizuka explained why the game needed more time before launching on the Switch 2, and his reasoning is pretty much in line with what we'd expected. Supposedly, the Switch 2 launch date of <strong>5th June 2025</strong> meant that the development team simply needed more time to optimise the game properly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We wanted to release the Switch 2 version at the same time [as other platforms].</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qjtgpl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>“But because the console’s release date was later, we wanted to make sure we could provide a game that optimised the new console."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Iizuka stresses that the game will achieve content parity with other platforms, including the Switch. One reason for this was the cross-play compatibility, with Iizuka stating "it’s important for people to get the same level of experience, no matter what console they are using".</p>
<p>It's not yet been confirmed whether CrossWorlds will max out at 4K resolution on the Switch 2, but we're expecting 60fps gameplay at the very least. Only time will tell, but hopefully we won't have to wait too much longer to see exactly how the game runs on Nintendo's new console.</p>

The developer also issued a warning for PC players, informing them that, due to a considerable number of underlying changes, installed mods may cause compatibility and stability issues. As such, Game Science suggests uninstalling the mods and verifying the integrity of game files before restarting the game if any issue arises.</p>



<p>Game Science also warned players that due to differences in file storage methods, the patch for the PlayStation 5 version will require a large amount of free storage space, approximately 93.5 GB. If the user cannot free enough space, the developer suggests continuing to play the game's current version.</p>



<p>Final update notes for the new Black Myth: Wukong patch have yet to be shared. We will update the post once the update starts rolling out and all the details are made public. </p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong launched on PC and PlayStation 5 in August 2024, so it’s definitely good news to hear that Game Science hasn't left the game behind, even following the announcement of the next entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>. Hopefully, these performance optimizations will be significant, as the game is still in dire need of them, especially on consoles, whose visuals and performance are impacted by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/">unusual development choices</a>.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about this solid soulslike by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">checking out my review</a>.</p>

            <p>Someone ring up Slayer, because it's going to raining blood in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> soon. That being the natural way to precede the arrival of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s first paid DLC bounty pack next month and a free December update that'll bring a weird tree fight to the endgame.</p>
<p>All of this stuff will lay a pre-Christmas foundation for the arrival of a fresh vault hunter early next year. That hunter, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-has-found-his-soulmate-an-edgy-cowboy-robot-named-after-money-thats-in-borderlands-4s-first-dlc">Gearbox showed off a little while ago</a> out of contept for chronological reveals, is Randy Pitchford's magic cowboy spirit animal.</p>

<p>This latest pulling of Borderlands 4 future additions from Randall Pitchenford's hat took place at PAX Australia. The man himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w6mSoYgaiPI?t=165s">walked onto stage</a>, mentioned his magicness, and referenced Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan in the presence of a 13 year old.</p><p>In light of that, I'll point out that you find out all of the info you need about what he was revealing via a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">handy post</a> that's less Pitchfordy. First of all, Borderlands 4's first paid DLC bounty pack dubbed How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will arrive on November 20th. It'll be an extra missions, legendary gear and boss fight affair based around Outbounders leader Rush battling with a dude called Screw over the way in which some kind of sellsword holiday celebration is, er, celebrated. This DLC's also bundled in with the deluxe editions of the game, so you'll get it at no extra cost if you've already spent extra money.</p>
<p>Preceding that will be a free Halloween-themed event called Horrors of Kairos, which is set to run from October 23rd to November 6th. It'll bring new legendary loot and also add blood rain to world boss battles. Make sure you don't mistake the crimson precipitation for jam, I suppose. Also, whose blood is it? Do we assume that it belonged to folks the boss has previously slain, in which case you might end up having your own blood drop on your bonce? Is there some kind of special Halloween blood supply that the gnomes who run Borderlands 4's clouds will only uncork every Halloween, like some aged vintage?</p>
<p>I digress, on to the final set of additions for this year. A free December update's set to deliver some extra bits to keep those who've already battled through almost all of the game happy. Bloomreaper the Invincible is a mutant tree thing, and also the first in a series of invincible endgame bosses who aren't actually invincible. As with its namesake Crawmerax the Invincible, however, Bloomreaper will be very tough. In line with that, the update'll also deliver a new difficulty level for Ultimate Vault Hunter mode.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Gearbox'll also be keeping up the patches, with next week's looking very much like it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-director-warns-next-patch-will-target-overpowered-builds-relying-on-unintended-interactions">murder some overpowered builds</a>.</p>

            <p>Screenshots of Rare's now-cancelled Everwild have emerged via the portfolio website of an artist who worked on the game.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">first announced back in 2019</a> as Rare's next big release. It was shown with an animated trailer of colourful environments and beautifully strange fantasy creatures, its visuals making an immediate impact. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">then shown again the following year</a> with a new trailer, showing player Eternals soothing those strange creatures.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn't clear exactly how it would play, but before we had a chance to find out, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">game was cancelled earlier this year</a> following widespread layoffs at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now, screenshots of the game's UI have been spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details">mp1st</a>, reportedly taken from a version of the game close to its cancellation.</p>
<p>The screenshots show the inventory menu, with players able to cycle between Favourites, Figments, Tools, Mosaics, Seeds, and Plants. Figments, in particular, look like strange little plant creatures.</p>
<p>To the right of the menu is an in-game view of the player character standing by a stone circle. While the menus suggest some sort of farming or base-building customisation gameplay, it's unknown if this is the main game or just a side activity.</p>
<p>Other screenshots show a list of graphical settings, while a couple of others give blurry, foggy views of the stylised visuals.</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, admittedly, but it's the only look at the game we've seen beyond the initial trailers.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Phil Spencer commented on the "progress" Rare was making</a>.</p>
<p>"It has been [a while]," he said. "And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Sadly, that time came to an end for Everwild. It's now unclear what the studio will be working on, beyond its live-service pirate game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>
<p>These screenshots follow a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-leak-fresh-info-suggests-studio-saw-gap-in-the-market-with-metal-gear-solid-and-bond-absent">leak of the also-cancelled Perfect Dark</a>, Rare's franchise that was set to be rebooted by The Initiative.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-%E2%80%98global-game-quota-exceeded%E2%80%99-error-explained.1323343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has roared onto the scene with an extremely successful launch, but plenty of players around the world are experiencing the ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’ error.</p>



<p>Immediately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smashing past Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count on Steam</a>, Battlefield 6 is one of the most successful titles to have launched in 2025, and, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of content planned</a> in future updates, there’s plenty of excitement for what is to come.</p>



<p>Errors and bugs can halt your progress, however, and we’ve got all the details on the ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’ error if it is thwarting your play sessions.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-battlefield-6-global-game-quota-exceeded-error">What is The Battlefield 6 Global Game Quota Exceeded Error?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boots on the ground. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’</strong> <strong>error indicates that the servers on the Portal feature are currently full.</strong></p>



<p>EA’s Portal feature, first introduced in Battlefield 2042, hosts community-created experiences, but it appears the servers are significantly more limited than they are for EA’s own game modes like Conquest and Escalation.</p>



<p>This will be due to a smaller capacity, likely because EA anticipates there are fewer players wanting to play these modes. However, the Global Game Quota Exceeded error is a clear indication that there is a larger demand than the servers can account for.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-fix-for-the-battlefield-6-global-game-quota-exceeded-error">Is There a Fix For The Battlefield 6 Global Game Quota Exceeded Error?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is currently no known fix to the Global Game Quota Exceeded error, and it’s unlikely to be anything that you can do on your end.</strong></p>



<p>This is because it is a server-side issue based on the fact that more players are trying to play modes through Battlefield Portal than the system can account for. As such, any solution will have to come directly from EA to increase the server capacity for Portal.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has yet to comment on the issue, but it’s still very early days in Battlefield’s lifespan, so there’s plenty of time for server changes to be made.</p>



<p>It’s likely the server capacity will be increased at some point, however, considering more people are likely to explore Portal game modes the longer time progresses since release, with a desire to experience more varied content.</p>



<p>What is the best mode you have uncovered so far on Battlefield Portal? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> has arrived on the scene with a bang, claiming the top spot in its debut week and pushing last week's champ, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, down into third. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> sticks around in second, because of course it does.</p>
<p>That means Nintendo's latest, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> has dropped all the way down to fifth, just one spot behind the ever-faithful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.

<p>And just for one final newbie, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> also made its chart debut in sixth, with 17% and 16% of sales coming from Switch 1 and 2, respectively.</p>

			<p>RTX Remix modder xoxor4d has released an initial compatibility build for Rockstar's GTA 4, providing a glimpse at the 2008 game with path traced graphics. ResetEra user gabdeg was able to test the RTX Remix build (which is currently only available to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xoxor4d's Patreon</a> subscribers at the Chocolate Strawberry Advocate Tester tier - $10 monthly - or above) and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-rtx-remix-released-up-3-13-25-out-of-beta.808098/post-146333869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a few screenshots</a>, which they said don't really do justice to the degree to which GTA 4's visuals are improved with path tracing, and that's without changing any of the game's default textures. We have added them to the gallery below.</p>

<p>xoxor4d previously managed to make several popular games compatible with RTX Remix, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-4-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Portal 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. Their work on the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD</a>, a build specifically dedicated to remaking the No Mercy campaign.</p>



<p>On the RTX Remix Compatibility Mods Discord, xoxor4d provided additional details for those interested in running the game:</p>



<p><em>As for the game version, the very latest Complete Edition (1.2.0.59) from either Steam or Rockstar Games is required. It should work fine on both versions, but I suggest using the RS version of the game as the Steam one has a few problems of its own (especially when running the game in windowed mode - if you plan on running fullscreen anyway, use Steam). It’s compatible with Fusion Fix, but can also lead to certain issues. I’ll eventually compile and ship a version of Fusion Fix that is specifically tailored to the RTX Remix compatibility mod.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fusion Fix</a> is a popular GTA 4 mod that fixes various issues and adds features like a Field of View slider, toggling effects such as motion blur and bloom, setting an FPS limiter, and more.</p>



<p>According to xoxor4d, the public release for the RTX Remix compatibility mod will not be available before the end of this month.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy fighting spin-off Dissidia is soon set to make a return after its PSP heyday, but so far it's only coming to mobile devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has teased an announcement stream (below) tomorrow, 14th October, with the game heading to both iOS and Android as Team Boss Battle.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/ddff/">website for the game</a> has been launched, with some lovely views of Tokyo and, separately, some silhouettes of Final Fantasy characters including Lightning, Rinoa, Cloud, and Zidane.</p>

<p>Little else is known about the game so far, but its mobile exclusivity will be disappointing for fans.</p>
<p>Dissidia Final Fantasy first released on Sony's PSP handheld in 2008 for the 20th anniversary of the series. It pits characters from across the franchise against each other in elaborate 3D battles, and received a follow-up in 2011.</p>
<p>Later, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT was released for arcades in Japan, followed by a release on PS4 and PC. Then in 2017, Square Enix released the mobile game Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">that game shut down in February last year</a>. Indeed, Square Enix has shut down a number of mobile games in the last couple of years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">Final Fantasy 7 The First Soldier</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>.</p>
<p>There's already concern, then, that this new Dissidia game will be another gacha-focused game with an ill-fated lifespan.</p>
<p>Yet the company seems intent on releasing new mobile games. Last month it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-dragon-quest-rpg-has-been-announced-as-square-enix-capitalises-on-renewed-series-success">announced Dragon Quest Smash/Grow for mobile devices</a>, capitalising on renewed series success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How much is too much when remaking a video game? And on the flipside, when does a remake end up not doing enough? For a lot of contemporary gamers, the right balance results in a legacy gaming experience that has all the bells, whistles, and graphics of a modern game. The modern remakes of Final Fantasy VII and Persona 3 got so many people excited, even if die-hards might feel like they’re an unnecessary facelift.&nbsp;For something like The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, a game with a near 20-year old legacy of its own, it feels insurmountable to strike the right balance between faithfully remastering yet meaningfully expanding that experience. Shockingly and excitingly, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a breath-taking remake that hits that balance perfectly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer - Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf6EItkZbPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s always layers of baggage going into any&nbsp;Trails in the Sky game, because it’s a long-running, deeply connected franchise of 100-hour JRPGs. The enduring legacy that makes&nbsp;Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;so compelling to dive into, though, is that it’s the very first game in that saga. The story of budding adventurers Estelle and Joshua is immediately accessible and endearing, and following them on their journey to become fully-fledged Bracers (essentially an independently-run group of peacekeepers) has all the nostalgic high-fantasy JRPG vibes I could ask for. Much like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/28/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-review/">Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a>,&nbsp;it’s so exciting to see such a vibrant, traditional, tech-fantasy world on display in a breathtakingly beautiful 3D adventure like this.</p>


<p>There’s still an undeniable charm to the chibi sprites and hand-drawn static environments of the original game, but the full-3D treatment that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;provides really lets you live inside the world in a way you never could with that original release. Even compared to the last mainline entry in this series, the quality of character models, animations, and even environments has shot up considerably. One of the things that Trails in the Sky&nbsp;is most known for is being a game where all the dozens of minor NPCs actually have unique names, and constantly-changing dialogue, and are weaved into the entire experience. With Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, it makes them feel that much more realised and, well, real. The main and supporting cast are full of more life than ever, thanks to this remake introducing full voice acting for the first time.</p>


<p>Rather than sticking to it’s original turn-based combat mechanics,&nbsp;Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;incorporates and updates the hybrid combat-gameplay introduced in the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;titles. As you explore the field, monsters will be roaming around, and you can either attack them in real-time with action-focused attacks&nbsp;or&nbsp;engage them in turn-based battles that let you bust out your full suite of abilities. Often times, you’ll be doing a mix of both – the action combat is fun and flashy, but your attack options are a bit limited and you’ll often end up staggering enemies in this state, which gives you the perfect chance to transition into a turn-based battle to finish them off. I can often get bored of turn-based combat in RPGs, and I’ve got a major soft-spot for real-time action, so the combo of the two here kept me engaged for my entire playthrough. That said, there were a few mandatory turn-based battles that did have me wishing there were some equally high-stakes mandatory action encounters to pair with them.</p>
<p>Turn-based battles in&nbsp;Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;work how you’d expect, with a character action timeline and status effect manipulations and so-on. One element of the progression system that made these battles really rewarding, though, was collecting and optimising my Orbments. Like Materia from Final Fantasy, each character can equip up to six different Quarts orbs in their Orbment setup, which each one providing a stat boost or ability modifier or entirely new spells. It’s a really fun way to fine-tune a character build and specialise each member of your party in unique ways, and whenever I hit a wall in certain dungeons or boss battles it was nice to be able to take a step back, look at my Orbment setup, and change things up to dive back in with a new approach.</p>

<p>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is also just full of so much stuff to do besides dive into dungeons and gawk at gorgeous cutscenes – it’s a game that is easily twice the length of the original version, but the sheer variety of activities and environments made all that time just breeze by so effortlessly. Side quests are a fun mix of simple fetch quests and unique, character-driven mini adventures that flesh out the supporting cast. Plus, nearly every NPC in the game gets new dialogue after a major story beat, making interactions with them as you walk through town feel so much more rewarding to repeatedly seek out throughout a playthrough.</p>
<p>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;is a massive transformation of the original experience, and yet those transformations never feel like they come at the cost of any of the original game’s charm or appeal. The vibrancy of the world and the living, breathing nature of the hundreds of characters who inhabit it feels so rewarding to explore in this remake – and it captures that magic while still retaining so much of the visual style and flair of the original. The result is a captivating JRPG that manages to blend a nostalgic, old-school vibe with a polished, rewarding, and fluid gameplay experience I never wanted to put down.</p>

<figure data-uuid="78fe0c6f9d84d"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78fe0c6f9d84d/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is known to be extremely litigious when it comes to protecting its intellectual property, but the company may have quite the battle on its hands if recent claims are proven to be legitimate.</p>
<p>Hacking group Crimson Collective has claimed to have breached Nintendo in what may be one of the most high-profile hacks in quite some time. The group has included an <a href="https://x.com/H4ckmanac/status/1976895206273220758">alleged screenshot</a> as "proof" of its actions, which includes a bunch of folders related to production assets, admin, previews, and more at Nintendo (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-hacking-group-claims-to-have-breached/">The Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Nintendo itself has not issued a statement on the alleged attack, so it's difficult to ascertain the legitimacy of these claims for the time being. We've reached out for comment and will update you if we hear back.</p>

<p>Crimson Collective has, however, proven to be particularly ambitious in its actions, having recently <a href="https://www.anomali.com/blog/red-hat-security-incident-crimson-collective-breach">breached the software company Red Hat</a> to obtain 570GB worth of data from GitHub repositories. The hacking group stated it was contacting Red Hat under official means to make extortion demands, but was predictably ignored. Red Hat then later acknowledged the hack and said it was in touch with the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>So is Crimson Collective perhaps doing the same thing with Nintendo? Possibly. It may have also bolstered its own efforts, having recently <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/news/2025/security/shiny-hunters-crimson-collective-red-hat-extortion">confirmed an alliance</a> with ShinyHunters and Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, two groups also known for high-profile extortion campaigns.</p>
<p>Nintendo is not likely to bow down to the demands of a hacking group, but if it doesn't and this is indeed a legitimate attack, then we may begin to see some leaks make their way online in the coming days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-how-many/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-player-count%E2%80%94how-many-people-play-tarkov.1323322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is the spearhead extraction shooter that has dominated the genre for a decade. It’s known as one of the most punishing games ever made, striking fear into the hearts of casual gamers worldwide since entering the scene in 2016.</p>



<p>Despite the game’s popularity, it’s pretty tough to get an exact number for how many people <strong>play </strong>Escape from Tarkov. In this guide, I’ve broken down the resources I have available to determine the most accurate Escape from Tarkov player count possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the numbers we have.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-escape-from-tarkov-popular">Is Escape from Tarkov Popular?</h2>



<p>There’s almost no information regarding the Escape from Tarkov player count that’s accessible to the public. Battlestate Games, the developer behind the extraction shooter, keeps a tight lid on the data.</p>



<p>However, in August 2025, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games offered a rare glimpse into the player numbers of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>On a Saturday evening at around 9 PM (BST), 45,000 people were playing PvP in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As Escape from Tarkov is only available on PC through Battlestate Games’ launcher (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-coming-to-steam-release/">until the Steam launch</a>), there’s only one number to look at, but that number <strong>does not </strong>include PvE players. It was previously mentioned that the player count between PvE and PvP can be as balanced as 50-50, so it’s safe to assume another 45,000 were playing PvE at that time.</p>



<p>That means that Escape from Tarkov had 90,000 concurrent players at a peak time on the weekend.</p>



<p>In numerical terms, that means that Escape from Tarkov is very popular, and it’s also safe to assume that the number <strong>swells </strong>when a special event or a ‘wipe’ hits.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-view-escape-from-tarkov-player-count">How to View Escape from Tarkov Player Count</h3>



<p>At the time of publishing, there were no reliable methods to use to determine how many people were playing Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>However, the Steam release of Escape from Tarkov is set to arrive in 2025, which would open up the data to everyone based on Valve’s API system. That means you’ll be able to see how many people play Escape from Tarkov <strong>on Steam </strong>alone.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got a better way to determine Tarkov’s player count.</p>

            <p>A French retailer has listed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, further adding to expectations of a release on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>Back in April, shortly after the game's initial release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, ratings board <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pegi-website-leak-suggests-assassins-creed-shadows-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">PEGI updated its website</a> to include Switch 2 under the game's list of platforms. Then, in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">Ubisoft itself hinted a Switch 2 version was on the way</a> as CEO Yves Guillemot stated the game has "some new versions…on other machines".</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867">Auchan</a> has a listing for a Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows, though there's no release date just yet.</p>

<p>However, judging by the box art, this will be a Game Key Card, just like Ubisoft's other Switch 2 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Audio developer on Star Wars Outlaws Rob Bantin previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">discussed the use of the key cards</a>, explaining having the full game on the cards as usual "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for", as the game's engine "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments".</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft revealed its new subsidiary Vantage Studios</a>, co-owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. It will be responsible for Ubisoft's biggest franchises, including Assassin's Creed.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">A ridiculous number of players</a> have flocked to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> over the weekend, hopping into multiplayer matches and testing out what's possible within EA and Battlefield Studios' big new release. This includes reaching out-of-bounds rooftops for absurd sniping spots, in spite of efforts to prevent such attempts.</p>
<p>Dubbed "Rooftop glitches" for self-explanatory reasons, the term describes any route or method which allows a player to reach the rooftop of a building that <em>should</em> be inaccessible. The benefits to abusing a rooftop glitch are plentiful, as it allows players with sniper rifles to settle in a location overlooking key objectives or funnel points.</p>
<p>In Battlefield 6's Siege of Cairo map, for instance, there's a large central street where much of a match's most explosive fights happen. It's meant to be an arduous position to fight over, without many truly safe positions to hunker down.</p>

<p>Enter the rooftop glitch, which allows snipers to climb on top of a wooden watchtower by the highway overlooking this street. With some fast sprinting and smart use of Assault Ladders, it takes around a minute or two to reach. Also, if you go prone while up there, you're totally safe from incoming fire from grounded enemies.</p><p>This spot (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@letstango94x/video/7560594039725346066?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-90VfckTs7Ai">which you can watch yourself on Tiktok</a>) offers great sightlines into the main street mentioned previously, as well as neighbouring buildings and attack points. It's a little bit busted and will probably get patched out in good time.</p>
<p>It's worth noting due to the open specialist system, where weapons aren't locked to their typical classes, it's easier for a lone sniper to make their way up to spots like this. This is because a player can use the Assault class with a sniper equipped to make use of those handy ladders, something not possible in a closed-off system. You'd have to wait until a squadmate on Assault made their way up their first, then spawn on them, before sniping from such a position would be possible.</p>
<p>This is not the first time players have scrambled up walls on to naughty rooftops on Siege of Cairo. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">the incredibly popular open beta</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mnns7t/rooftop_glitch_on_siege_of_cairo/">alternative means of reaching such illegal peaks were uncovered by the game's initial wave</a>. With thousands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-face-extensive-queues-this-weekend-as-servers-immediately-reach-capacity">trying to get through the queues and play Battlefield 6</a>, who knows just how many will suffer at the hands of untouchable snipers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-products-aren%E2%80%99t-being-removed-by-target-and-walmart-despite-rumors-to-the-contrary.1323310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over this weekend, several Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1o4b1w7/my_local_target_is_getting_rid_of_their_xbox/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.cbr.com/target-removes-xbox-series-stores-trump-tariff-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Target and Walmart, two of the largest retailers in the United States, were effectively removing Xbox products from physical stores. The report caught like wildfire among the Xbox fanbase, especially following the previous news that another big retailer, Costco, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already done just that last month</a>.</p>



<p>However, eventually, other reports to the contrary started appearing on the Web by sources like YouTuber Destin Legarie, who <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1977486029960732978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>I just called my local Walmart to ask if they were discontinuing or pulling Xbox stock. They said, "at least to my knowledge, I haven't heard anything about clearing inventory or anything like that. Or about being discontinued." They also said they still have them in stock.</em> <em>I also called Target to ask if they were pulling or discontinuing Xbox stock. The person working there told me… "There's nothing in our system showing anything being discontinued. But we also haven't had a shipment in about a week. It says we have the next one on October 19th, but just for 1. Nothing is saying discontinued."</em></p>



<p>Windows Central also <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conducted its own investigation</a> and later even managed to get Microsoft to comment on the issue with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft appears to always be rushing to extinguish some kind of PR fire. Then again, it is largely its own fault, for its constant strategy shifts have baffled the Xbox fanbase to the point where they are willing to believe any kind of rumor.</p>



<p>Following many studio closures and layoff rounds, the latest blow to the Xbox brand's reputation came in the form of the massive Xbox Game Pass restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced last week</a>. The Ultimate tier suffered a huge 50% price hike, and the new middle tier, called Premium, won't ever get Call of Duty games. All this was even more egregious after executives had boasted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass was already profitable</a> and had just reached a new revenue record in the last fiscal year.</p>



<p>Needless to say, users assaulted the Xbox Game Pass cancellation page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelming it with requests for a while</a>. Analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are worried that the damage to the brand might be lasting</a>, especially because of the sense of broken trust.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout’s first season was a rampant success, pulling in millions of viewers, reigniting a fierce love for the post-apocalyptic games, and allowing Bethesda Game Studios to flex some development power with Fallout 4’s next-gen upgrade.</p>



<p>Now, fans are waiting on the edges of their seats for Fallout Season 2, which is set to drop later this year. It’s an expansion on the story that played out in April 2024, with returning and new characters set to grace the screens in the post-nuclear wasteland of Fallout. When is Fallout Season 2 coming out, though?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-first-episode-date">Fallout Season 2 First Episode Date</h2>



<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 will be released on December 17, 2025. </strong>The first episode will give us a look at New Vegas, recreated in full, authentic fashion for the award-winning television series.</p>



<p>The first season dropped in April 2024 and gave fans of the franchise a whirlwind tour of a new setting, original story, and fresh characters. It was a phenomenal success, and for a while, player counts across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-games-growth-player-count-tv-show/">every Fallout game</a> skyrocketed.</p>



<p>That hype has continued, and in December, Fallout 76 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-ghoul-fallout-76-walton-goggins-burning-springs/">get a new update</a> linked with the Fallout television show, launching alongside the second season.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-fallout-season-2-be-released-all-at-once">Will Fallout Season 2 Be Released All At Once?</h2>



<p>The second season of Fallout breaks away from the operating model of the <strong>first </strong>season and offers a once-weekly release pattern. The first episode drops on December 17, and the final episode will arrive on February 4. In total, there are <strong>eight episodes </strong>in the new season, which is the same format as the first season.</p>



<h2 id="h-confirmed-cast-for-fallout-season-2">Confirmed Cast for Fallout Season 2</h2>



<p>Fallout Season 2 features the following cast:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell)</li>



<li>Maximus (Aaron Moten)</li>



<li>The Ghoul (Walton Goggins)</li>



<li>Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones)</li>



<li>Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan)</li>



<li>Norm MacLean (Moisés Arias)</li>



<li>Robert House (Justin Theroux)</li>



<li>Betty Pearson (Leslie Uggams)</li>



<li>Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton)</li>



<li>Barb Howard (Frances Turner)</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional characters are yet to be confirmed, such as the role for the rumored arrival of Macaulay Culkin.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/complete-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-pok%C3%A9dex-all-pok%C3%A9mon-listed.1323304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s launch week for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which means plenty of leaks are starting to emerge, and the full list of Pokémon available to catch in the Pokédex have been revealed.</p>



<p>Releasing October 16, Legends: Z-A is the second entry in the Pokémon Legends series, following on from the success of Legends: Arceus, and will kick off a big year for the franchise, with the 30th anniversary next year seeing the release of a new spin-off game, Pokopia, and the expected launch of Gen 10.</p>



<p>If you want to know exactly which Pokémon are available to hunt down in Legends: Z-A, we’ve got the full list for you.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Familiar faces. Credit to Game Freak</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A Pokédex, based on the information currently available, has 243 Pokémon to collect—not including variants.</strong></p>



<p>In comparison, Pokémon Legends: Arceus had 242 Pokémon, including the complete Sinnoh Pokédex, whereas Z-A does not have the full Kalos <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokédex</a>. However, more Pokémon will be added in the Mega Evolution DLC, which has been confirmed to be released post-launch.</p>



<p>Unlike recent titles, there are no regional variants in Legends: Z-A, with the focus instead being on the introduction of new Mega Pokémon. There are 26 new Mega Pokémon in Legends: Z-A.</p>







<p><strong>We’ve compiled a full list of the Pokémon available to capture in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which we’ll update accordingly if any have been missed.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows all of the available Pokémon, including their variant forms. We’ve excluded gender forms from this list, along with the many variants of Flabebe and its evolution line, Vivillon, and Furfrou.</p>
