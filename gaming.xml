            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-unique-games-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has revealed that it's still looking to make "unique and interesting" games following its acquisition by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton earlier this year.</p>

<p>In an interview with Japanese news platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/681/G068145/20241212042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (with additional reporting and translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tango-gameworks-will-continue-to-make-unique-games-after-acquisition-by-krafton-lead-devs-confirm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Tango Gameworks execs Colin Mack, John Johanas, and Kazuaki Egashira discuss their studio's future and its approach to creativity.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">washed its hands</a> of Tango (alongside&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin) earlier this year, leading many to believe that the studio's days were done. However, Krafton then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">swept in</a> to purchase Tango Gameworks, as well as the <i>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</i>IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=8ePluDFi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=lOX1yOyG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks still wants to make "unique" games after its acquisition by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Egashira confirms that Tango Gameworks' overall goal is "still IP creation", and that rather than making creative decisions, Krafton's part in things is to help Tango "expand".</p>

<p>That appears to be a sentiment echoed by Krafton itself, incidentally. Back in September, CEO Changhan Kim said he didn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">would be a profitable endeavor</a>, but that his company wants to "try something new" and take risks, which is a rather refreshing outlook.</p>

<p>Johanas chips in by saying that he wants Tango to be somewhere people think of games as "their baby" rather than as "some task to be done", and Mack says Tango's goal is to continue to create "unique and interesting games" for the studio's fans.</p>

<p>In short, if you were worried that Krafton would transform Tango into a sequel mill or a DLC producer for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, then it looks like you needn't worry; the goal at the moment appears to be to let the studio retain its unique identity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=_OhRTwgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=inBCNRJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks also developed both&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, although the studio doesn't own the IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the interview stops short of Tango announcing exactly what it's working on next, although we do know that there are plans to expand&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, so we may well get a sequel announcement in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>For now, though, rest assured that whatever Tango does next, it's likely to come out of leftfield in a similar way to their previous projects. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Insults are so serious, these days. They're all so <em>insulting</em>, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the instigator of the roast and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I've made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.</p>

<p>In one of the strangest stories you’ll hear, an NFL owner reportedly made team decisions based on player ratings in EA Sports Madden NFL. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed trades and questioned potential free agent signings due to various ratings in the game. </p>



<p>In one particular instance, Johnson nixed an offseason trade for former Denver Broncos wide receiver (WR) Jerry Jeudy because his Madden rating “wasn’t high enough”. Jeudy ended up being traded to the Cleveland Browns instead. In his first season in Cleveland, he has put up 1,052 receiving yards and four touchdowns.</p>



<p>Another example was Johnson questioning the signing of guard John Simpson. The report states that Johnson didn’t like Simpson’s awareness rating in the game, leading to push back. Luckily for the Jets, General Manager Joe Douglas signed Simpson who has been one of the better players at his position this season.</p>



<p>As far as why Johnson is using Madden ratings to make real-life decisions, it stems from his sons Jack and Brick after they were including in meetings. </p>



<p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” an anonymous Jets executive told The Athletic.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, a spokesperson for the Jets declined the claims.  </p>

Thames Valley Police has confirmed it is investigating the robbery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards are surprisingly common, this one has particular weight to it given Ace Grading is a grading company and not just a vendor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These companies receive cards from collectors and grade them out of 10 to add value and authenticity, meaning every card taken wasn't strictly the property of Ace Grading but instead the property of hundreds of card game players and collectors around the country.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those affected have already received an email from Ace Grading, it said, along with instructions on claiming compensation. "We have already determined appropriate compensation amounts, and this will be issued without delay," it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some trading cards do hold incredible value, with price tags of hundreds of dollars fairly common and some rising to thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars. While collectors will receive compensation back, it will likely be no real replacement for the cards themselves which can be incredibly rare and difficult to find replacements for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of increasing value is also a consideration, as grading cards, as mentioned, is a way to ensure their authenticity and increase their value, something that will only go up as time goes on. A card worth $1,000 today may be worth $2,000 in five years, for example, so a cash value replacement for its current value likely won't appease many of those who submitted their cards for grading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ace Grading said it has "implemented additional, robust security measures to further protect [collectors'] property and maintain the integrity of our facility. We take these matters extremely seriously and remain committed to the trust that you have placed in us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading cards have long been the target of thefts given their high value, but high profile sales such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">a Magic: The Gathering Card selling for $3 million</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-wears-most-expensive-pokemon-card-to-wrestlemania">a Pokémon card selling for more than $5 million</a> have seemingly spurred more and more criminals to pursue them in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department noted this increase in 2022</a>, saying it had seen an unprecedented number of crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards in the latter half of that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are myriad high profile examples to point to too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">A gaming store in Minnesota saw $250,000 worth of product stolen</a> after thieves broke through its wall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stolen-gen-con-products-worth-300000-confirmed-to-be-magic-the-gathering-cards">$300,000 worth of Magic: The Gathering cards were stolen</a> from North America's largest board game convention in Indiana, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">a total of 35,000 individual Pokémon cards were stolen</a> from a collectibles store in California.

                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>. Sonic 3 director Jeff Fowler also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-was-dedicated-to-researching-shadow-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3/1100-6527492/" data-ref-id="1100-6527492">Reeves was serious about researching Shadow's character</a> before he took on the role for the movie.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will be out in theaters on Friday, December 20.</p>

                <p>Sony Group has agreed to buy more than 12 million more shares in Elden Ring parent company Kadokawa Corporation, with Sony becoming Kadokawas's largest shareholder. Sony will own 10% of Kadokawa's shares after buying 12,054,100 new shares for about 50 billion yen ($319 million USD).</p><p>Sony Group <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it plans to buy the shares on January 7, 2025. It follows on from Sony's previous acquisition of Kadokawa shares in February 2021.</p><p>Sony and Kadokawa have worked together on a number of projects throughout the years, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors swirled recently </a>that Sony might have been plotting to buy the company outright. That isn't happening, though, at least not at this stage.</p><p>As part of the deal, Sony said it will work together to adapt some of Kadokawa's franchises for global and TV dramas and live-action films, though no specifics projects were announced. Sony will also co-produce Kadokawa anime projects and "further expand" its publishing efforts for Kadokawa's games.</p><p>From Software's Elden Ring is one of Kadokawa's biggest gaming projects, and the series continues in 2025 with the debut of the standalone game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">Elden Ring Nightrein.</a> Beyond gaming, Kadokawa is known for media franchises like Re: Zero and Delicious in Dungeon, among numerous others.</p><p>Sony is also heavily invested in Fortnite studio Epic Games.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-1-arrives-with-over-1800-fixes-including-a-life-changes-and-more.1065288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1, and it comes with an absolutely astonishing number of fixes for over 1500 of the game's bugs, including changes to the controversial A-Life system and more.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that much like the rest of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, the game's A-Life AI system (that's AI in the trad sense, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/at-least-1000-steam-games-using-generative-ai-per-new-report" rel="nofollow">generative sense</a>) is riddled with bugs, but some of those bugs have been addressed in today's update.</p>

<p>You should now encounter more roaming NPCs in the Zone, and NPCs should no longer spawn behind your back. Additionally, A-Life NPCs should now be visible at greater distances, and groups exploring the Zone should be "more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.1-bunker.jpg?itok=E23MqMgA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.1-bunker.jpg?itok=ae7TUqKM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 is chock-full of bug fixes.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just A-Life, either. Other changes have also been implemented, like a reduction in number for Pseudodog clones, which could threaten to overwhelm you in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Rewards for "several missions" have been increased, and "multiple improvements" have been made to characters' facial animations and voice work in "several cutscenes".</p>

<p>You can also look forward (or perhaps that's the wrong phrase) to&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s infinite money glitch being gone from the game. No more can you exploit the Zone's weird logic to make yourself rich. You'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Since there are almost 2000 fixes in this update, there are far too many for me to list here. Be sure to check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to see everything that's changed.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2007's influential cult classic&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was the spelling being used at the time, and it hasn't been retroactively changed at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game was in development for some time; originally announced in 2010, it went through a lengthy development cycle and at least one development reboot before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">fully re-revealed in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to many development setbacks for Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, causing the game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">times</a> before its eventual release earlier this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also on Game Pass (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, anyway). Make sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">our very own Robert N. Adams' review here</a> to find out how things have changed in the Zone over the last 17 years or so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, an upcoming remake of 2004 JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, will be getting a worldwide release next year.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will arrive across the world in fall next year, and that it'll also be coming to PC and PlayStation 5 alongside its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap" rel="nofollow">previously-announced Nintendo Switch release</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, it was named&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, presumably in keeping with the naming convention used by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436670/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky_the_3rd/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third instalment&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>. It looks like Nihon Falcom has abandoned that particular approach, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=3i5GUBww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=jmK-eThI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>is getting a simultaneous global release.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo are promising that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will serve as a "full 3D remake" of the original game, complete with "brand-new localizations, enhanced visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics".</p>

<p>Although it'll have a fresh coat of paint and more,&nbsp;<em>1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will still tell the same story as the original game, in which protagonists Estelle and Joshua set out to become Bracers (essentially a sort of peacekeeping force).</p>

<p>Along the way, they're caught up in a wider conspiracy that comes with all the usual JRPG trappings; world-saving drama, twists and turns, and plenty of character moments to get you attached to your party.</p>

<p>You can check out the first major trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a sense of what's changed in the kingdom of Liberl since last you visited (or introduce you to it if this is your first time).</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, in fall 2025. We don't have a more specific release date than that yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity.1065246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED did a veritable press tour for The Witcher IV reveal after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer's debut at The Game Awards 2024</a>. After talking about Ciri as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protagonist</a>, revealing her new voice <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>, and confirming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwent</a>, the developers stopped by for an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel Skill Up</a>. Here, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba discussed the game's scope, which is said to be similar to The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p><em> I'll give you guys an anecdote first before I answer the question. I remember when we were thinking about how many hours you would need to, let's say, finish The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. When we threw the numbers, we were like, maybe 5 or 10 hours for Heart of Stone and maybe 10 or 15 hours for Blood and Wine, and we ended up with 30 hours. Of course, empirically, we have so much knowledge regarding the structure of The Witcher 1, 2, 3, the structure of Cyberpunk 2077 and all the expansions, so we use this data. But we look at the scale a little differently. We don't want to be servants to the numbers. </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the map of The Witcher IV is definitely more or less the same when it comes to the size.</em> <em>The amount of quests is also more or less the same, but again, the game is going to be big, but also, the ambition of the entire team is huge. First and foremost, we want to deliver a super compelling experience. So, again, quality over quantity. But definitely, what we can promise is that, yes, this game is going to be pretty big. It's going to be comparable to everything we've done so far, but I cannot tell you if it will be 90%, 85%, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>For the record, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is definitely a huge game. The main story alone can take over 50 hours, and with all the side content, it goes easily above a hundred hours, even if you don't want to complete every single hunt and Easter egg. Still, Kalemba emphasized the studio's focus on quality.</p>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated addendum, the Game Director of The Witcher IV also stressed that this is not the beginning of the game's marketing campaign. It was simply a reveal of the title and the new protagonist. The game entered full production earlier this year, so there's still a long wait ahead for fans - probably a couple of years, if not more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-console-focused-project-8.1065243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 11 bit studios has laid off an unknown number of staff and canceled an upcoming project previously codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message to investors</a>, the studio confirms that its management has "resolved to discontinue the development of the game codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>", and that this discontinuation will result in a loss of around 48.4 million Polish zloty (that's about $11 million).</p>

<p>Board president&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was "conceived under very different conditions" for the industry, during a time when "narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=BLf8GgEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=NE6TQglj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios' most recent game is the snowy city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>He says that after an assessment of&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s progress, management found "unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address".</p>

<p>Together with what&nbsp;Marszał calls "revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment", caused management to harbor "significant doubts" about&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s "overall profitability", hence its cancellation.</p>

<p>Shutting down&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>will also result in layoffs,&nbsp;Marszał and 11 bit say. The studio doesn't disclose exactly how many employees' jobs are on the line, but&nbsp;Marszał does say that "more than half" of&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s 37 developers will be offered opportunities to work elsewhere within 11 bit.</p>

<p>In closing,&nbsp;Marszał says that despite this setback, 11 bit has what he calls a "clear and well-defined roadmap" for its future projects, including the continuation of work on&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">release of upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></a>.</p>

<p>The studio itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">said that the game was already profitable</a> just a few days after launch, but shares in the company plummeted after&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s release, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an analyst saying</a> the game's Steam player peak was "a negative surprise" compared to expectations.</p>

<p>What's more, the game has now recouped its investment and has turned a profit, according to the studio's owner Maxim Krippa in an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653">Forbes</a>. Krippa also confirmed at least two expansions and multiplayer are planned, with no further details provided.</p>
<p>The developer notes Patch 1.1 is "huge" so will take some time to download. It includes A-Life fixes and AI improvements, balance adjustments, crash fixes and performance optimisations, issues with specific story missions, and more.</p>

Mutants, stalkers, bandits, and other inhabitants of the Zone move around, hunt, fight among themselves for lairs and territories, or join groups."</p><p>The system was criticised by players for feeling too scripted and not organic enough. A number of fixes have now been implemented, increasing the rate players will encounter roaming NPCs, improving the navigation of NPCs, enhancing their motivation to expand territory and actively attack, and other changes.</p>
<p>Further small AI improvements have been made to both NPCs and enemies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, several missions have received increased rewards, an infinite money exploit has been fixed, performance has been improved in largely populated areas, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365">Steam notice for the full patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for your support and feedback," the notes read. "We will continue working on the game, listening to your comments and reviews to investigate all possible issues and solve them as soon as possible."</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues.</p>
<p>However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p><p>Creative director Mariia Grygorovych also acknowledged issues with the game at launch. "It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems," she said. "But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>

            <p>The CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> studio Arrowhead has responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> crossover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-receives-first-ever-crossover-with-killzone-2-cosmetics">crossover with Sony's Killzone 2</a>, revealed yesterday, adds a number of themed items and cosmetics to the in-game store and is the first of its kind for the game. However, players have criticised their cost.</p>
<p>Usually, extra content is unlocked through a Warbond costing 1000 Super Credits (£7.99), which includes multiple weapons, armours, and cosmetic items. The Killzone 2 items are instead available to purchase separately, with all six items totalling 1,975 Super Credits - so two batches of 1000 Super Credits totalling £15.98, essentially doubling the price.</p>

<p>Separately, the StA-52 assault rifle costs 615 Super Credits (the most expensive item) and the AC-1 Dutiful armour costs 500 Super Credits.</p>
<p>Players have since responded negatively on the game's Discord server and reddit, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user posting</a> "615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt responded to a player on X who said the price "definitely felt steep".</p>
<p>"Sorry you felt the price was steep, we are looking at all feedback," Pilestedt replied. "The reason we changed it from a Warbond was actually because there were concerns that having a higher priced Warbond would carry negative sentiment."</p> <div>

<p>Over on Discord, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani responded (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/">PC Gamer</a>). "Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration so we'll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you'd like to see in the future," he said. "Secondly it's optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free."</p>
<p>He later added: "This was my way of saying that the better the game does the more stuff we can do."</p>
<p>Further, Jorjani noted while Arrowhead is partnered with Sony, pricing was the studio's decision. "This one is on us," he wrote.</p>

</span></p><p>As stated in the crossover announcement, the collaboration marks the start of a new five day rotation length in the store.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," Arrowhead said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-to-become-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawas-biggest-shareholder.1065213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-biggest-shareholder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has acquired more shares in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, which will make the Japanese gaming giant Kadokawa's biggest single shareholder (although it still doesn't have a majority stake).</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Sony has agreed to acquire over 12 million Kadokawa shares in January to the tune of about $318 million. This will give Sony a stake of around 10% in Kadokawa, making it the single largest shareholder in the company.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that as GI.biz points out, Sony already has a 14% stake in Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">purchased shares in the studio back in August 2022</a> alongside Chinese gaming monolith Tencent (which has a 16% stake in FromSoftware, but no stake in Kadokawa).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=hK0K9CiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=dIPkn9f0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa could be closer to an acquisition deal with Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, the acquisition deal "goes beyond the sale of shares" and also includes plans for Sony to adapt Kadokawa IP into "live-action films and TV dramas", as well as an expansion of publishing and distribution for Kadokawa's games and anime.</p>

<p>This news comes just a few weeks after Kadokawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report" rel="nofollow">confirmed that it was in talks</a> for Sony to acquire it outright, but that no decision had been made as yet. This deal could see Sony moving one step closer towards that acquisition.</p>

<p>While Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, it's also the owner of companies like <i>Zero Escape&nbsp;</i>studio Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow"><em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=W4n1dMCy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=d9cC1QRk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa also owns&nbsp;<em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>studio Acquire, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, FromSoftware arguably remains Kadokawa's most well-known and successful subsidiary, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">sales of open-world action RPG&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Other recent successful Kadokawa releases include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, another game published by Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">topped three million sales in a single day</a> and which also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">received an update bringing split-screen multiplayer to all of its stages</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>isn't the only Spike Chunsoft release to land in the last few weeks, either. Roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc" rel="nofollow">netted itself a PC release recently</a>, having netted itself 200,000 sales on Switch in Japan "quickly" after release.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Sony's acquisition of more shares in Kadokawa will eventually lead to an outright purchase. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornoby’s 1.1 update and patch notes represent the first major changes to the shooter. GSC Game World has made a ton of changes to Stalker 2 to its performance and fixing lingering key issues, and we have the full patch notes to check out.</p>



<p>The launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2</a> has been a resounding one, and successful enough to show the world wants more irradiated exploration. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 was considered profitable</a> only one month after its debut, and GSC Game World has already been hard at work, trying to repair some of the title’s technical detractions.</p>



<p>Now, the Stalker 2 1.1 update delivers the biggest and most important fixes to date. Outside of headline-making improvements to A-Life, the 1.1 update for Stalker 2 brings with it a staggering <strong>1,800 improvements</strong>, distributed across gameplay, AI, missions, the general open world, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-stalker-2-dec-19-update-1-1-changes">Biggest STALKER 2 Dec. 19 Update 1.1 Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-a-life-is-alive-and-well">A-Life is Alive and Well</h3>



<p>It’s no secret A-Life has been a bit buggy and somewhat irrational since launch. Stalker 2’s 1.1 update should make this less of an issue though as the patch notes fix a variety of A-Life issues: NPC interactions feel more natural, they should be more frequent, and better optimization for NPCs in offline mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-amp-balancing">AI &amp; Balancing</h3>



<p>Stalker 2 suffers from a lot of problems many games have at launch: Issues pop up that didn’t in testing, and certain aspects need appropriate buffs and nerfs. A bunch of animations and AI behavioral patterns have been amended in the Stalker 2 1.1 update, whereas rewards, item values, abilities, ammo distribution, and weapon attachments have all been tinkered with in the full patch notes.</p>



<h3 id="h-missions-were-a-main-mission">Missions Were a Main Mission</h3>



<p>A ton of missions and side quests have been addressed in the 1.1 update for Stalker 2. The tweaks include missing characters vital to the progression of quests now being present, misbehaving mission markers, absent cutscenes, and a whole host of other improvements designed to keep progression smooth.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-list-of-stalker-2-update-1-1-fixes-amp-improvements">Complete list of STALKER 2 Update 1.1 Fixes &amp; Improvements</h2>

However, he says Sega has been improperly claiming it is the actual owner of the song and behaving as such, including licensing the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Gioeli's suit claims that Sega is basing its ownership of Live and Learn off "a 2001 lyric agreement where Gioeli was paid $3000 to write lyrics for a as-yet-untitled song that would be included in Sonic Adventure 2." He did so at his home studio, using his own equipment and own vocals, allegedly without Sega's direct involvement. He did work with Sega composer Jun Senoue over the phone, with Senoue initially sending him a music demo that Gioeli was supposed to write lyrics for. But the suit claims that the scope of Gioeli's work expanded over the course of his work on Live and Learn without amendment to the initial agreement, which was only for the lyrics. Allegedly, Gioeli revised the song significantly, communicating changes over the phone to Senoue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Gioeli says Sega claims it owns both the recording and musical composition, but argues this is not actually the case and that there is no agreement stating such. And Gioeli also claims that Sega has acknowledged in the past that the composition is "likely jointly owned", with one Sega lawyer allegedly telling Gioeli at one point that he is entitled to 50% of profits from its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli allegedly was somehow unaware that Sega has been using Live and Learn with regularity in a number of other formats over the last 20 years. This is despite Gioeli working closely with the company on a number of songs throughout this time, all of which had far more specific agreements signed about who owned what. Per the suit, he only found out about its myriad uses through a fan telling him, and has since identified 25 video games it exists in. These include multiple Yakuza and Sonic games, Super Smash Bros, Phantasy Star Online, the maimai series, and Monster Hunter Rise). Notably, Gioeli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-3-will-feature-sonic-adventure-2s-beloved-song-live-and-learn-band-confirms">was involved in the song's inclusion in the recent movie Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> (which we've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba">just reviewed</a>), and even signed the deal with Paramount for song placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli is seeking a court decision as to the ownership of Live and Learn, as well as a restitution for any money he is owed and damages for breach of the 2001 Lyric Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Then, in August, it was announced that South Korea’s PUBG publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton had reached an agreement to acquire Tango</a>, along with Hi-Fi Rush, granting the studio a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid such dramatic twists and turns, Tango has retained many of its staff for this new iteration. IGN spoke with studio head Colin Mack, creative director / Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and development director / Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira about their plans for Tango Gameworks going forward.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/hfr1-1734592108151.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas.

That is to say, the team had previously been working on a sequel at the time of the acquisition, and it seems pretty likely that they will continue to do so, but at this stage a sequel is not guaranteed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are considering a sequel positively,” Mack told IGN. “We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, ‘This is what we're going to do.' ”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas added: “Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options. We’re currently at the stage of considering various opportunities.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From The Evil Within to Ghostwire: Tokyo and finally Hi-Fi Rush, Tango Gameworks is known for creating brand new games, and it seems that this culture still persists in the studio’s latest incarnation under Krafton. Egashira explained that creating new experiences is “in the DNA of Tango Gameworks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated,” he said. “I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the center, without losing our passion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not only me, but many of the development staff have a strong attachment to Hi-Fi Rush,” said Johanas. “Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the other hand, it's important to try new things. I worked on The Evil Within, directed its DLC, and then directed the sequel The Evil Within 2. I don't think I could have made yet another horror game at that point, because there’s only so much you can do with the same material. It’s risky to try something completely different, sure — but I think a sequel to a series is also a risk in itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton’s acquisition of Tango Gameworks came about when the studio members, faced with imminent closure, began looking for a buyer. Krafton was proactive in courting the team and moved extremely quickly to propose and finalize the acquisition, allowing many of the staff to stay together. “I’m glad that we were able to continue making games together while keeping the DNA of Tango Gameworks intact, rather than starting from scratch again,” said Johanas, highlighting how the team’s chemistry was built up over years of working together, and played a big part in the success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio currently has around 50 employees, and Mack says they will begin recruitment in late December or January 2025, with a view to growing to around 100 people. This will allow them to focus on making one game at a time while also experimenting with new projects on the side, much like how Hi-Fi Rush was initially created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas also recalled advice given to him by Shinji Mikami, the legendary developer who founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving in 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush. Mikami was keen to foster new talent at Tango, and Johanas essentially became one of his apprentices, influencing his views on how the studio will continue into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I learned from Mr Mikami that it is important for a director to discuss ideas for a game with their team rather than giving orders, and to make the game together,” Johanas said. “He often said that if you make a game like a bonsai tree, it may take the shape the director had in mind, but each of the development staff will not feel their output is reflected. In that sense, freedom is very important. Of course, it is necessary for the director to decide the overall direction, but we have always valued an environment where the staff can create freely, rather than one where they are only allowed to as they are told. It's closer to the growth of a tree in nature than a bonsai tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mikami places a high level of trust in his staff, which is why so many of us have stayed at Tango Gameworks for so long. I hope to continue this culture of freedom in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For information on recruitment at Tango Gameworks, check out </em><a href="https://www.krafton.com/ja/careers/jobs/?var_page=1&amp;search_list_cnt=10&amp;search_studio=TangoGameworks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Krafton’s recruitment site</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Chinese megacorp Tencent is next in-line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa and Sony have formed what the pair described as a ‘Strategic Capital and Business Alliance,’ with the goal to boost Kadokawa’s long list of intellectual properties globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of the deal includes vague corporate speak about how the two companies plan to work together in the future, but there is a line about adapting Kadokawa’s IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-producing anime works, and further expanding the publishing of Kadokawa’s games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That line in particular has already sparked speculation that Sony may help realise a live-action Elden Ring movie or TV series of some kind, but it’s worth pointing out that much of Sony’s interest in Kadokawa has to do with its anime business, as opposed to its video game business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki commented: "Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims">financial experts said the PlayStation maker might have been put off the deal due to the cost of having to acquire all of Kadokawa</a>, rather than the parts it was actually interested in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa was reportedly only interested in doing a deal with Sony if it bought the entire company. Sony, however, was reportedly only interested in “extracting” assets related to anime and video games, which presumably included the developer of Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying all of Kadokawa would cost 640 billion yen (approx $4.3 billion), according to expert estimates. Sony’s cash for buyouts is apparently tight at the moment due to investments made elsewhere. As a point of comparison, Sony bought Destiny developer Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022. The studio has since suffered multiple rounds of layoffs and project cancelations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the apparent prospect of a bidding war, or scope for Sony to buy 50% of Kadokawa and turn it into a subsidiary it doesn’t wholly own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa’s business extends into areas that fit into Sony’s broader entertainment offering, which includes anime, manga, TV, and film. Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation. As well as FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns Danganronpa developer Spike Chunsoft, Octopath Traveler developer Acquire, and RPG Maker and Pixel Game Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games. Kadokawa is the majority owner of FromSoftware, with around 70% of the company. Sony already owns around 14% of the developer, with Tencent owning around 16%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Sony, its gaming business has already suffered significant layoffs this year and the closure of multiple studios, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord"><u>Concord developer Firewalk</u></a>. In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>it announced a round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs impacted a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for FromSoftware, it's working on multiplatform Elden Ring spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which is due out next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em><em> A previous version of this story claimed Sony had become the majority shareholder of Kadokawa, when in fact it has become the largest. An edit has now been made. We apologize for the error.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Crush 40 musician and Sonic songwriter Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America over ownership of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> theme song Live and Learn.</p>
<p>Gioeli has claimed Sega only has rights to the lyrics of the song and not the "master recording and musical composition", the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">lawsuit</a> reads (as shared by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega">Polygon</a>), but "unbeknownst" to the songwriter Sega has "exploited and licensed" the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films".</p>
<p>Live and Learn features heavily in the latest film, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, though Gioeli previously confirmed to <a href="https://aftermath.site/sonic-movie-live-and-learn">Aftermath</a> a deal was signed for its use with Paramount.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Gioeli claims he was paid $3000 to write lyrics for an as-yet-untitled song to be included in Sonic Adventure 2. He then "ended up arranging, producing, recording, and performing vocals on Live and Learn, which was produced out of his home studio in California using his own equipment without the supervision, control, or involvement" of Sega.</p>
<p>Further, Sega's assertion it owns full control over the master recording and music composition is "without basis" as there is no agreement in place with Gioeli to transfer rights beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gioeli has "maintained his songwriting registration" for the song for over 20 years. The songwriter holds the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721">copyright</a> for Live and Learn, where he's listed as having authorship over the music and lyrics. The date of this registration is 2024.</p><p>Gioeli does admit the "composition is likely jointly owned", the lawsuit reads, and is therefore seeking a Court decision to determine the ownership of the song. The writer is also seeking $500,000 in damages, and a further $500,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>Gioeli has worked with Sega composer Jun Senoue on multiple Sonic soundtracks, together writing and performing under the name Sons of Angels, which was later changed to Crush 40.</p>
<p>While his work on Live and Learn was "expressly limited in scope to lyrics" as per his agreement with Sega, Gioeli received demos of instrumental portions from Senoue and a back and forth ensued with Gioeli's input.</p>
<p>Gioeli "controlled and oversaw the recording process, produced the recording, directed the arrangement and of the song, directed the recording process for other musicians, and recorded and performed the vocals", the lawsuit reads.</p>
<p>Gioeli worked with Sega for over 20 years, from 1998's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-sonic-at-olympic-games-tokyo-2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit states he was made aware by a fan of Crush 40 that Live and Learn was present in other well-known games, including the likes of Sonic Generations, multiple Yakuza games, multiple Super Smash Bros. games, and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>"I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega," Gioeli told Polygon. "I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sega for further comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> releases this week, capping off Sega's Year of Shadow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster project mod is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements to the PlayStation 4 exclusive which has become fully playable on PC this year thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator.</p>
<p>The 0.8 version of the mod introduces plenty of improvements over the previous release, such as more point lights, more parallax occlusion mapping, some reflectance map changes, and more. The new features introduced by the new version of the mod are explained in great detail by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, creator of the mod, in the video below. The mod can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

<p>Having a playable PC version of Bloodborne has been a dream for soulslike fans for a very long time, and it has finally become a reality earlier this year, as mentioned above, thanks to the fast improvement of the ShadPS4 emulator over the past few months. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but things continue to improve steadily, and a recent update of the emulator addressed some of the most common issues with the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/">RAM usage spikes, excessive VRAM usage, and frequent crashing</a>. The reduction in VRAM usage is actually a rather significant improvement, as this should allow those with older GPUs to run the game better.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that has made Bloodborne playable on PC can be found on its official website.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-fall-2025-on-pc-and-consoles.1065168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today has been a day of announcements for Japanese publisher Nihon Falcom, who has revealed an updated version of Ys X as well as the release window and platforms for the previously announced Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, a remake of the first entry in the sprawling Trails series.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the updated version of the tenth entry in the series, which was released only a few months ago in the West. This new version of the game will feature plenty of new features, including a new location, Aland Island, located to the north of Obelia Gulf, where Adol and Karja will meet another mysterious Mana user, learn new Mana Actions, and more. Together with the new story content, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature new bosses, Mana Ride races, and arena battles that will put players' skills to the test. The game has only been announced for Japan as of now and will launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Besides announcing Ys X: Proud Nordics, Falcom revealed today that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which was revealed for Nintendo Switch earlier this year, will also launch on PC and PlayStation 5 during Fall 2025. The game will be published in the West by GungHo Online Entertainment, complete with English and Japanese voice-overs and English, Japanese, French, and German subtitles. A new trailer showcasing the overhauled visuals and combat system over the original was also released today, and you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd9j_NWZGG8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement of more platforms and a release window for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is very welcome, the announcement of Ys X: Proud Nordics so close to the Western release of the original version of the game is far less so, even though it is a completely enjoyable experience, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">review</a>. Hopefully, players won't need to purchase the game again to enjoy the new content, which sounds rather substantial.</p>
