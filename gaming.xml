            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>creator and RocketWerkz head Dean Hall has announced he and his team are working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" by the name of&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</p>

<p>Announcing the game <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/1851832821020790791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hall says he's working on&nbsp;<em>KSA&nbsp;</em>with RocketWerkz alongside "former members of the&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>team and amazing modders".</p>

<p>Right now, the game looks to be in its early stages; the footage Hall showed off in his post simply shows a moon's surface, then zooms out (albeit seamlessly) to reveal a galaxy of planets, all soundtracked by some appropriately moody synth music.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=d5xCeo72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=QwKZf6qu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dean Hall and RocketWerkz are currently working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" called&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying comment</a>,&nbsp;Hall goes into more detail regarding RocketWerkz's new project, as well as his own efforts to pitch Private Division on a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Hall says that his studio was in "the top three bids" to work on&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but that because his team's pitch focused on the technical side of things and didn't contain any art, his studio wasn't chosen.</p>

<p>However, Hall says that for&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Agency</em>, he and RocketWerkz have employed several developers who worked on both&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, as well as a mystery "key person" who is a "key individual in our industry".</p>

<p>There's also a little more nerdy technical information contained within Hall's comment, including how the video footage's seamless movement is achieved, how the team deals with floating point precision loss, and more.</p>




<p>If you're wondering why exactly a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer would be needed, look no further than Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">apparent shutdown</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games (although Take-Two itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denies closing that studio</a>).</p>

<p>Reportedly, Take-Two is also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-planning-to-close-or-sell-private-division" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking to close down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division, so despite the company's claims to the contrary, <i>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</i>might not be a going concern for much longer.</p>

<p>There's a niche a mile wide, then, for someone like Hall to slide in with a game that's similar enough to&nbsp;<em>Kerbal&nbsp;</em>that people take interest while also being different enough to carve out a niche for itself.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether RocketWerkz achieves this, but in the meantime, you can join the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aCwHR7HJ4W" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with things as they happen.</p>

It sounds like Warner Bros. is now revisiting the prospect of some kind of film adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s books, even if the project is still in the earliest stages of development. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193818" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="258" data-playlist="193818,197298,197284" data-current="193818"><div><p>The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19270.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, the studio is making at least one <em>Game of Thrones </em>movie, though the project doesn’t yet have a script, director, or cast associated with it. These “concepts of a plan” for a theatrical adaptation of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> might soon break free of its existing HBO prestige TV enclosure, something the company had resisted in the past. </p><p>While we don’t have any idea what such a movie would focus on, from entirely new events to existing portions of Martin’s world that haven’t yet been adapted to TV, it seems unlikely a project would be able to rival the previous success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> without involving that cast and characters in some way. Maybe it’s not unthinkable that we might get a complete do-over of the show’s much-maligned ending, something fans have long speculated about. </p><p>Any movie would also be coming out alongside a full suite of new <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV, from <em>House of the Dragon</em> season three and<em> A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> to a host of other spin-offs and animated adaptations. Not all of Warner’s grand plans for the fantasy IP have come to fruition, however. A direct sequel with Kit Harington reprising his role as Jon Snow was infamously abandoned, seemingly over a lack of strong ideas for where to take the character after the as-of-yet unfinished conclusion of Martin’s books. </p><p>  <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> points out that a new era of post-merger Warner Bros. seems much more comfortable with major franchises seamlessly hopping between streaming and the big screen. The <em>Harry Potter </em>movies are currently being remade as a TV series, and<em> The Batman</em> has already spawned a very successful spin-off in <em>The Penguin</em>. It’s not hard to see<em> Game of Thrones</em> going in the opposite direction five years after the conclusion of the original show. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Playdate Season 2 is set to drop in 2025.</p>
<p>Whilst no firm release date has been revealed as yet, developer Panic said it would have "a new collection of surprise games developed specifically" for its dinky handheld system next year.</p>

<p>Details on "price, the exact number of games, and the developers begins [them]" will be confirmed next year, with Panic stating that whilst the pandemic and unprecedented chip shortage up-ended plans to simultaneously release games at the exact same time the first time round, "Playdate 2 hopes to deliver on that original idea" next year.</p>
<p>Interested? Playdate owners will be able to purchase the fresh batch of games via Playdate's Catalog when it releases. All new Playdates sold will continue to have Playdate Season 1 bundled in with the price of the system itself.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning, the number one question from Playdate owners has been: 'When will there be another Season?'" says Greg Maletic, Playdate project lead.</p>
<p>"Season One was a hit - players loved games like Crankin's Time Travel Adventure and Zipper. They also loved the excitement of receiving two surprise games a week: that time-release aspect encouraged players to dive deeply into each title before the next arrived. But one thing we couldn't do with Season One was synchronize play for everyone. With Season Two, we finally can!"</p>
<p>Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, there was an even bigger Playdate puzzle - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">$400k worth of Playdate game consoles disappeared in Las Vegas</a>, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it "a bit of a true crime drama".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has given fans and investors an update on all of its current games. The updates come via the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest earnings report</a> on November 1.</p>



<p>Starting with Alan Wake 2, it was reveal that it has made most of its development and marketing cost back since its release.</p>



<p>According to company CEO Tero Virtala, Alan Wake 2 has yet to “generate royalties”. The studio released The Lake House expansion on October 22, wrapping up post-launch plans for the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-other-remedy-entertainment-games">What About The Other Remedy Entertainment Games?</h2>



<p>With Alan Wake 2 in the rear view mirror, Remedy is continuing its focus on a number of projects internally. FBC: Firebreak, which was codenamed Condor at the studio, “continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.”</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass as well as the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers. It will be self-published by Remedy and be a “mid-priced” title.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Control 2 remains in the production readiness stage with plans to enter full production in 2025.</p>



<p>“Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being  tested in preparation for full production,” Virtala said.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake continues in full production. No update on a potential release for that game was revealed.</p>

The official PC specs for the game are now live, and while it's not too demanding in terms of RAM, GPU, and CPU requirements, you will need to ensure that you have 150GB of SSD storage capacity available.</p><p>Like several other modern games, Stalker 2 lists a solid-state drive as a mandatory requirement, likely due to them having vastly superior read/write speeds when compared to traditional hard disk drives. Developer GSC Game World has previously spoken about how it has attempted to create a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-is-a-frightening-but-alluring-return-to-the-zone-hands-on-preview/2300-6465350/" data-ref-id="2300-6465350">photorealistic version of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone</a>, and early previews of Stalker 2 have shown off a lush environment for players to explore.</p><p>Beyond that, the rest of the PC requirements <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed on Steam</a> are very forgiving toward older machines, possibly as a result of Stalker 2 being in development for a long period of time. GSC Game World recommends an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM and 16GB of RAM, although it's worth noting that the system requirements didn't list what kind of graphical output players can expect. If you're aiming for a 4K resolution and high frame rates, you'll likely want newer hardware to get the best out of Stalker 2.</p><h2>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl PC Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i5-7600K</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 150GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 7 3700X / Intel Core i7-9700K</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 150GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD</li></ul><p>"Navigating anomalies, navigating the open world and its mysteries, and navigating the politics of different competing factions all have me excited for Stalker 2.

<p>First announced in 2010, Stalker 2 was originally scheduled to release in 2012. Unfortunately, due to studio closure, an eventual reformation, a restart of development, and numerous delays, fans have had to wait 15 years for the follow up to Stalker: Call of Pripyat.</p>



<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass. That exclusivity to the Xbox Series consoles is expected to be for at least three months.</p>

There are new characters, new story content, a new minigame, free recruitment opportunities, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a third-person idle shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for free on iOS, Android, and PC. You lead a squad of android soldiers called Nikke, the last hope for reclaiming the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who have forced humanity underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been going strong, with more than 45 million downloads worldwide in the two years since release. To celebrate that success and give back to fans, Shift Up launched an extensive anniversary event that is ongoing now. The festivities started on October 26 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO9vY4nE3A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> that included lots of rewards, both in game and out.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-1-1729706806095.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new story event called Old Tales, which will let players see earlier events through the eyes of Cinderella. She previously was an enemy who players defeated during the first anniversary event Red Ash, but now you’ll get to see things from her perspective and learn more about her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cinderella, Grave, and Rapunzel: Pure Grace will be three new characters added as part of the anniversary celebration. All three are SSR Nikke, the highest rarity of Nikke in the game. There will be lots of free recruitment opportunities that accompany them as well, making this an ideal time for newcomers to dive in.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-2-1729706806096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you log in during the anniversary event, you can claim up to 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers and a SSR Nikke choice box, which will let you choose between two characters to recruit for free — either Snow White: Innocent Days or the new character Rapunzel: Pure Grace. The Cinderella Pick Up Recruitment event will give you one free recruit every day until November 21, while the Grave Pick Up Recruitment event will also give you a free recruit every day from November 7 to November 28.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-3-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you complete the Old Tales event, you’ll get several rewards: 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers, 15 Ordinary Recruit Vouchers, and 2 SSR Nikke choice boxes. The rewards for all of these events stack, so if you take part in all of the anniversary events on offer, you can get multiple guaranteed free characters and dozens of free recruitment opportunities. So new players can get a nice jumpstart to begin their journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Since its inception, Goddess of Victory: Nikke has routinely added new minigames that spice up gameplay. It added a tower defense minigame during the 1.5 anniversary and a Dave the Diver collab minigame during this year’s summer event. That tradition continues with the second anniversary, which introduces In the Mirror, an action-platforming minigame focused on platform jumping.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-4-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also taking the celebration out into the real world. It has partnered with Bushiroad to create a Nikke trading card game that will now be published worldwide for the first time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta period has begun, and despite the fact that this isn't even a full game release, it's already broken Steam player records for the franchise as a whole.</p>

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3065170/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's stats</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">open beta</a> shows that the test hit a staggering total of 463,798 players at its peak, and that it's currently sitting pretty at 441,009 players (at time of writing).</p>

<p>By way of comparison,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which remains the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest-selling</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to date, managed 334,684 players at its busiest on Steam, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>hit 231,360. Both are very respectable totals, but they don't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' beta test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=eguERMHa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=uc3NSK0D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is taking the world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>While it could be contended that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>are both paid premium products,&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' open beta is also leaving the free demos the series has offered in the past in its dust.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>'s demo, for instance, attracted just 23,991 players at its peak, while the demo for expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>topped out at 27,540. Again, those aren't numbers to be sniffed at, but they do show just how popular&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta is.</p>

<p>The open beta is free, of course, and so many players may be checking it out even if they don't intend to buy the full game. Still, it looks like Capcom will have another bona fide success on its hands when&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">launches in February</a>.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs.</p>

<p>Set in the Forbidden Lands, the game will once again see players venturing out into large semi-open world areas to do battle with a series of monsters, including the game's new flagship beast Arkveld, also known as the White Wraith.</p>

<p>The open beta offers a look at the character creator, as well as an open hunt and a portion of the story. Of course, the internet has already <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-character-creator-is-being-used-to-make-scarily-accurate-recreations-of-superheroes-actors-and-characters-from-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created some pretty impressive stuff</a> with said character creator.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/showa-american-story">Showa American Story</a> is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:</p>

<p>It’s so wonderful, somewhere between RGG and Grasshopper Manufacture, with a little bit of one of my all time favourite films, Tokyo Gore Police, thrown in for good measure. It’s “a brand new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> and an enthusiastic love letter to the 80s' pop culture that features a strong taste of B-Movies,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687540/Showa_American_Story/">Steam</a>. “Follow Choko's journey of truth and revenge across North America as she grows stronger.” It’s from Nekcom, who previously put out the confoundingly named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699700/DYING_Reborn/">DYING: Reborn</a> - a gory escape room. Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Showa 66, Japan has bought out most of the United States with its strong economic power. A surge of immigration has firmly planted Japanese culture within the American continent. Two cultures are rapidly amalgamated, although conflicts are inevitable, citizens gradually adapt to a life never imagined as time goes by.</p>
<p>However, a mysterious catastrophic incident changes the world drastically. The social order is long gone. An unknown amount of time passes, a teenage girl mysteriously revives from the dead, only to find a brand new wild post-apocalyptic world with zombies, monsters, and human survivors of different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as combat, you’ll be travelling around the US in a “big” RV. It’s big! You’ll be able to customise it, as well as “enhance Choko's status and unlock abilities through various enjoyable "Living Activities". Finally, the enjoyable living activities I crave. No release date on this one yet, but you can bet I’ll be shouting loudly about it as soon as we get one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With her unusual green skin and lack of understanding regarding her unique powers, Elphaba becomes the target of hostilities. However, an unlikely friendship between Elphaba and Glinda forms before the two encounter a crossroads that will alter their destinies and change the landscape of Oz forever.<br></p><p>Over on IMDB, <em>Wicked </em>is slowly dropping in popularity, though it’s still in the top 50 upcoming releases, making it a top choice for the fall season. On Rotten Tomatoes, it’s too early to tell. No official critic or fan reviews are available, leaving the film’s rating unavailable.<br></p><p>From director Jon M Chu (<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and <em>In The Heights</em>) and starring Cynthia Erivo (<em>Bad Times at the El Royale</em>), Ariana Grande (<em>Don’t Look Up</em>), and Jeff Goldblum (<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>), <em>Wicked </em>officially hits theaters on Friday, November 22. It’s a musical fantasy adventure with a runtime of two hours and 40 minutes, making it somewhat challenging for those with young children who can’t sit still in the theater.<br></p><p>Whether you’ll have a kid with you or not, some early previews of <em>Wicked</em> indicate childlike wonder awaits at the theater:<br></p><p>Variety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katcy Stephan</a></span>:<br></p><p>“I was ‘pessimistical’ going in, but...WICKED is a masterpiece.

Jon M. Chu perfectly captures the magic of the Broadway show while adding in some of his own unique flourishes to the source material. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo completely knock it out of the park as Elphaba and Galinda. Jonathan Bailey is also quite phenomenal in the film. Wicked lives up to the hype and often succeeds it. Oh, and there is one scene that fans of the Broadway show are going to absolutely lose their minds over. Wicked is hands down one of the year’s best films.”<br></p><p>WBAL-TV, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Veneziani</a></span>:<br></p><p>“One of the most perfect musical adaptions to ever exist. 💚💗 #WickedMovie exceeded my expectations.

But it also falls into some of the traps of the Disney live-action remakes that diminishes its power — overlong, noisy, over-designed. Overall I liked it a lot and can’t wait for part 2🧹.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> brings the traditional round-based format back, and players have been digging their teeth into Liberty Falls and Terminus, reaching high rounds and discovering the Main Quest for both maps.</p>



<p>Treyarch love to hide little secrets and Easter eggs in Zombies, which have become an integral part of the experience in the mode. Speaking of which, you may have found Loot Keys in both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> and wondered what they are and how to use them.</p>



<p>So, here’s what to do with Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to use Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can use Loot Keys to <strong>open safe deposit boxes in the Liberty Falls Vault and lockers in Terminus Armory</strong>. You can get different rarities of Loot Key. The higher the rarity, the better the loot will be in the respective caches.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough, you can earn yourself a free Perk, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapon</a>, or even a Legendary weapon. You can also get Equipment, Scorestreaks, Salvage, and more. You can only open one safe deposit box or locker per Loot Key.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can get Loot Keys in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies via r<strong>andom drops from mini-boss enemies</strong> such as Manglers, Abominations, and Amalgams. Once you pick a Loot Key up, you’ll find it in your Personal Items inventory.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-liberty-falls-vault-combination-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Liberty Falls Vault combination in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>The Vault is in the Liberty Falls Bank and you’ll need to enter the combination to enter it. You can find the combination by following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the front desk of the Bank, you’ll find a yellow post-it note with a number and three blank spaces. This is the first number for the Vault combination. </li>



<li>You’ll find the second number in Fuller’s Liberty Lanes on the front desk just under the desk lamp to the right of the lanes.</li>



<li>The final number is in Olly’s Comics on the inside of the shelf in the middle counter area where the employee’s dead body can be found.</li>
</ol>



<p>Combine the numbers in the correct order and enter the combination at the Vault to open it and earn some great loot. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-use-loot-keys-in-terminus">Where to use Loot Keys in Terminus</h2>



<p><strong>You can use Loot Keys on Terminus in the Armory</strong>, which is located in the same room as Stamin-Up (lower floor of the Control Center). Here, you’ll see a door with some computers near it and a set of windows looking into the Armory. Simply walk to the door, enter the Armory, and use a Loot Key on one of the lockers to earn some loot.</p>



<p>You don’t need to do anything to unlock the Armory door, all you need to do is walk up to it and enter. Don’t worry about Zombies pilling up outside the Armory either, as once you leave a massive blast will eliminate Zombies in the area so you can get out scot-free.</p>

Kojima clarified that the title screen is "still very much temporary."</p><p>Right now, the screen features the game's name and a background image of Norman Reedus' character, Sam Porter, and a baby. The title screen has options for "Continue," "New Game," "Load Game," "Options," and "Recap of Death Stranding." That last one might be handy for anyone who needs a refresher on the events of the 2019 game, which had a narrative full of twists, turns, and <a href="https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Conan O'Brien. </a></p><p>In another update, Kojima shared an image of his work desk featuring a very comfy-looking chair. A second image appears to show multiple Death Stranding 2 save files.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 follows Sam and his companions as they embark on "a new journey to save humanity from extinction." Players will travel through a world full of "otherworldly enemies" and obstacles, while players will also face existential questions throughout the story, according to the game's description.</p><p>As mentioned, Reedus returns in the lead role, while Lea Seydoux comes back to play Fragile. Troy Baker, meanwhile, returns as Higgs. Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna join the sequel in new roles.</p><p>As for when we might see or learn more about Death Stranding 2, that remains to be seen. Kojima revealed Death Stranding 2 at his good friend Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards in December 2022. Some are expecting more information about the sequel to come at the 2024 edition of the show this December.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is set for release on PS5 at some point in 2025. Kojima is also developing an Xbox-exclusive game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, along with an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint.</a></p>

            <p>
After a year on sale, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally close to recouping the money Remedy spent on developing and marketing the game.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's latest <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">financial results</a>, published today, note the critically-acclaimed Alan Wake 2 is still to "generate royalties", but had now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". 
</p>
<p>
The long-awaited sequel has struggled to sell in big numbers since its launch this time last year. The past month has seen Remedy move on from its development, following the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">second and final expansion The Lake House</a>, and the release of the game's physical deluxe edition.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Eurogamer Let's Play: Alan Wake 2!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGs1FX3V_vE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
More generally, Remedy said its development costs for the past quarter had increased due to higher development fees for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1&amp;2. Royalties decreased, meanwhile, as sales largely consisted of the aging Control and original Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
In the long-term, Remedy said it was still committed to growing both Control and Alan Wake brands as "a key part of our future", with Control in particular set to be expanded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">recently-unveiled spin-off FBC: Firebreak</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy's first full multiplayer project is set to launch as a "mid-priced game" in 2025, though will also be offered as part of both Xbox and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what's next for Alan Wake, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/01/playback-hydrophobia-prophecy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playback-%E2%80%93-hydrophobia-prophecy.1025109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/01/playback-hydrophobia-prophecy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Some of you may not remember it, but back in 2010, Hydrophobia was a pretty big deal. Not because it was a well lauded and much loved game, but because it wasn’t. In fact, the original release of Hydrophobia was met with so much negativity that the developers Dark Energy Digital reworked it, changed a voice actor, overhauled levels, and added a final boss. This new package was released in 2011 as Hyrdophobia Prophecy. It was supposed to be the start of a trilogy, but the difficulties the game faced saw Dark Energy Digital go out of business, leaving us with just the first part of this story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hydrophobia Prophecy Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RzSF0EV-84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other reason that Hydrophobia Prophecy was a big story at the time was its water tech, which was the basis of the game’s HydroEngine. This engine allowed water to flow and move just like it does in reality, which really helped the game stand out for at the time. Water is almost ever present throughout Hydrophobia Prophecy, set on the giant city ship The Queen of the World as it comes under attack by the terrorist group the Neo-Malthusians. The world is in an overpopulation crisis, so this group wants to kill off the majority of the human population so the survivors – themselves, of course – can flourish.</p>


<p>Kate Wilson is merely an engineer aboard the ship, but she has to fight back against the Neo-Malthusians in order to save it, the people, and the research being carried out on it. She is joined by Scoot, her manager who is no more than a guiding voice. In the original Hyrdophobia, Scoot had a Scottish accent, but this voice was one of the complaints players of the original release had, so in Prophecy his voice was replaced by a more neutral North American accent. His role is to help guide Kate through the ship, though plenty of waypoints make that easy, as well as to make the occasional quip when Kate kills a Neo-Malthusian.</p>


<p>For a game that’s two generations old, there are still elements of Hydrophobia: Prophecy that feel fresh. The most obvious is how water moves through levels and areas, and the other is the underwater combat. These moments add a proper three dimensional combat situation where you are not just trying to shoot at the enemies on the platforms in front of you and behind you, but also those that are swimming around, below, and above you. These are proper cat and mouse moments, as you may spot an enemy swimming below and manage to get your shots off first, or you may suddenly be under fire from an unexpected angle, requiring you to get Kate’s bearings right to respond in kind.</p>
<p>Kate’s gun has different ammo types, with the basic round being a shock round which is unlimited. This joined by rapid fire, gel, and energy rounds later to give different advantages. However, shock alone is pretty handy throughout the game. Charge a shock round up, and you could take an enemy out in one hit. They can also destroy hazards including loose wires that are sending electricity into the water, making areas impassable. The game is littered with these basic puzzles, though it can also use elements in more novel ways. One such example is collecting floating tanks and putting them into heavy containers to make them float up to unblock passages.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Hydrophobia: Prophecy is that it ends just as it is getting going. The third and final act, just before you face off with the boss, gives Kate the ability to control water. You can tell the development team would have expanded on these further in future releases, as this lets Kate summon a water tower and throw objects through that final boss fight against a giant security bot. Once that fight is over, the story ends, and while a challenge mode lets you use the water powers in some scenarios, it’s simply not enough.</p>
<p>In some ways, Hyrdophobia: Prophecy was ahead of its time. It was one of the earliest tales of a developer reacting to audience feedback to build a better experience, and this resulted in a more competent, if somewhat by the numbers third person shooter. Yet it pushed tech in other ways with the water physics and rendering a still impressive element. It is unfortunate that the trilogy never materialised to continue Kate’s story. Just imagine what things could have been like if the HydroEngine had been refined further and the tech used in more games in the early 2010s.</p>

			<p>When Red Dead Redemption launched on PC on October 29, the author of the Reality Redemption overhaul mod, BadassBaboon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they would soon port it for this version. The mod was originally made for the Xbox 360 version (<a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-xenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which could run on PC via Xenia</a>) and the Nintendo Switch version of the game. However, the modder encountered an issue running the game on his configuration. In the meantime, other modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> providing texture mods for specific areas, like grass, particles, and the protagonist himself.</p>
<p>Now, though, BadassBaboon has resolved their issue with launching the game (they had to roll back to an earlier version of Windows 11, for some reason), and Reality Redemption for PC can be downloaded here. It's by far the most comprehensive improvement mod for Rockstar's open world masterpiece. Here's a list of its current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase memory pools and improve general performance</li>
<li>Improve reflection quality</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for vegetation</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for the map</li>
<li>Improve particles and particle count</li>
<li>Improve debris variation and count</li>
<li>Improve physics for liquids like water</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior</li>
<li>Improve the game camera to behave more like RDR2</li>
<li>Improve the Euphoria physics</li>
<li>Improve random events spawn and spawn rate</li>
<li>Improve materials and their interactivity</li>
<li>Improve culling</li>
<li>Modify the movement animations for smoother transitions</li>
<li>Improve John Marston textures</li>
<li>Improve game world textures such as trails, roads, grounds, and grass</li>
<li>Fix the nighttime broken fog and other time cycle shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in the video below, the improvement is significant, and that's even with only 2K textures. I spoke to BadassBaboon about trying to push textures to 4K and they said they'll try.</p>
<p><iframe title="PC Red Dead Remaster with Reality Redemption - Overhaul Project" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6y410L5K5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond a potential texture upscale to 4K, there are also several Reality Redemption features that have to be finished or implemented, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve secondary character textures and building textures</li>
<li>Improve tree textures and smaller physics-based props</li>
<li>Improve cloud skyhats</li>
<li>Improve vehicle draw distance</li>
<li>Improve the shadow maps and shadow distance</li>
<li>Improve sky lighting and time cycles</li>
<li>Improve weather and cloud variations and improve the overall weather system</li>
<li>Improve cloud shadows</li>
<li>Add an option to disable rainy weather at Thieves Landing</li>
<li>Fix the moonlight ground overbright issue</li>
<li>Improve rain effects</li>
<li>Figure out why R* didn't implement a proper PostFX system in this game</li>
<li>Increase some memory allocations</li>
<li>Update the game's lore with new dialogue and subtitles</li>
<li>Improved weapon and environment sounds</li>
<li>Add new and improved particle and effect textures</li>
</ul>

The studio has released two expansions for Alan Wake 2 this year that have likely helped - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-announced-releasing-tomorrow-sgf-2024">Night Springs</a> and, more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-ii-lake-house-expansion-reveal-trailer-state-of-play-2024">The Lake House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 shifting to generating royalties seems inevitable, and will likely be a big deal for Remedy.

            <p>Electronic Arts has blocked Steam Deck players from its cooperative shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Stating that "the openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers", EA has determined that making its game available on the Linux system - such as Apex Legends - is "a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats."</p>
<p>Developer Respawn said it was left with no choice given there is "no reliable way" to differentiate between legitimate Steam Deck players and "a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck".</p>

<p>"We're sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">said</a> community manager, Mako.</p>
<p>"Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we're battling cheaters - this is one to add to the list.</p><p>"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Steam storefront for Repawn's free-to-play battle royale, which used to be deemed "playable", now states in no uncertain terms that Steam Deck compatibility is "unsupported". Respawn insists this decision will not impact Apex players on Steam PC.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if any further competitive game makers follow suit.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors earlier this week during the company's quarterly earnings call. Asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends, Wilson said the battle royale is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community", suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-2-not-on-the-cards-right-now-ea-ceo-says">it may be a while yet until we see Apex Legends 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Early on in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare offers a knowing nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series, via a cheeky line of dialogue.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to start playing, there's nothing particularly spoilery below - but fair warning if you'd rather encounter the Easter egg for yourself. 
</p>
<p>
You always need someone good at tinkering with tech on your team, it seems - and in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, that's elven engineer Bellara. So, when it comes to sorting out a misfiring Eluvian mirror, she's your girl.

</figure>
<p>
I spotted that chatting to Belara while she's attempting to repair the Eluvian continued to provide several lines of extra dialogue, and ultimately resulted in her offering up a catchphrase made famous by Mass Effect's immortal sidekick Garrus Vakarian. 
</p>
<p>
"Sorry Rook," Belara can be heard to say, "I'm just in the middle of some calibrations."
</p>
<p>
Garrus' insistence he be left alone to focus on his gun calibrations in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> became something of a meme, as players continually checked in with the character in the hopes of hearing new banter, only to have the same dialogue about needing to do more calibrations pop up over and over. 
</p>
<p>
Other Dragon Age: The Veilguard players have spotted the Easter egg too - here's a quick recording:

</span></p><p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">new Mass Effect game</a> is still very much on the agenda from BioWare, though is likely still several years away. Early work has been ongoing for some time, and this week we heard from project director Michael Gamble on some of the difference between the two franchises - including how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Mass Effect 5 will deal with the series' established visuals and tone</a>.</p>
<p>This week, our Bertie chatted to Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider to hear about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">how BioWare knew some of the series' biggest plot points years ago, but kept its secrets hidden away</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
