		<p>ARC Raiders is the game of choice for a lot of people right now, with players scouring the surface of the planet for supplies while dealing with ARC’s machines and the actions of other players. Like any game, not everything is perfect at launch, so today ARC Raiders update 1.1.0 has been released to address some issues like being able to push players through walls and Augment skills not always working. The full patch list is below.</p>

<p>In our ARC Raiders article, Stefan pondered whether the game could be for everyone, and said, <em>“ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix is the latest video game publisher to push for AI usage in video game development, aiming to let it handle a critical part of development almost completely by 2027.</p>



<p>As part of the company's latest earnings report, the Japanese publisher shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Progress Report on its Medium-Term Business Plan</a>, detailing some of the initiatives underway to boost long-term growth, which include promoting AI utilization in Japan. This is being achieved through the initiation of joint research with the Matsu Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes using AI technology.</p>



<p>The current goal of this joint research project is to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027. This will <em>"improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development"</em>, Square Enix detailed in the report. As of now, the research team is composed of more than 10 people, including researchers from the Matsu-Iwasawa Laboratory and engineers from Square Enix.</p>



<p>While Square Enix has only started researching AI usage in QA, other publishers are already using it for their titles, putting testers' jobs at risk. Last month, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA has already been using AI in QA for a while</a>, as a former employee at Respawn confirmed that over 100 people were laid off last Spring because the company started using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, which was work previously handled by human employees.</p>



<p>Square Enix's plans to utilize AI to enhance game development efficiency appear to align with a prevailing sentiment among the most successful Japanese video game developers, such as Masahiro Sakurai and Hideo Kojima. Both developers are not averse to using AI to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">make large-scale game development sustainable</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">let it handle tedious tasks to allow them to focus on the creative process.</a></p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A has been out for three weeks at the time of this writing, and has had a stunning commercial start with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">5.8 million copies sold in its first week</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/">strong sales in both the UK and the US</a>. Continuing the momentum, today, The Pokémon Company announced that the game's first paid DLC, Mega Dimension, will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices this coming December 10, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came with two new trailers, one that's more of a cinematic showcase of the new DLC, and another that goes into more detail about Mega Dimension and lays out what to expect in the paid expansion.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As shown in the cinematic trailer above, Mega Dimension marks a historic change for the Pokémon series, which is that the level cap for Pokémon, which has been at level 100 for the entire history of the series, has been removed, and you'll now have to face Pokémon far, far stronger than level 100.</p>



<p>The DLC begins with the introduction of a new character, Ansha and her partner Pokémon, Hoopa. They pull you into a new dimension and a new version of Lumiose City that has new versions of Pokémon running around the city, but you're not just there to capture new Pokémon. You're also there to uncover a mystery behind distortions that are appearing across Lumiose City, with the help of Ansha and Hoopa.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Wccftech's review of Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, our reviewer Nathan Birch gave it an 8.5/10, and<em> </em>wrote, "<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-haley-joel-osment-sora-instagram-story-2000641691</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-how-you-make-coping-kingdom-hearts-fans-lose-their-shit.1345813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s tough being a </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fan when Square Enix drops an announcement trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> then mostly disappears for three years. These days, those waiting to hear more about Goofy and company’s next foray into the Disney/</span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>crossover universe will lap up even the smallest of crumbs in hopes that it means a full-course meal could be waiting for them at the end of development. This week’s crumb is an Instagram story from Haley Joel Osment, the voice behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-best-games-ranked-2-3-birth-by-sleep-1851494518"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>’</span></a><span> key-wielding hero Sora, that implies he’s recording…something!</span></p> <p><span>On November 5, Osment posted a photo to his Instagram story of a big red sign that says “RECORDING” with the caption “Back to work” in what looks like a recording studio. Now, this could be for anything. Osment has done plenty of voice work over his decades-long acting career, and most of it’s not limited to playing Sora in the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>series since the PS2 era. Take a cursory look at his acting credits, and you’ll see he’s done a lot of voiceovers for tons of animated Marvel, DC, and </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>projects over the past few years. So it’s entirely possible he’s just doing another routine gig.</span></p>

 <p><span>But we also don’t know that this </span><i><span>isn’t</span></i><span> him gearing up for another monologue about how Sora’s friends are his power, right? </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>still in an uncertain point of development</span></a><span>, but if Square Enix is considering a re-reveal of sorts, it’s entirely possible Osment is doing a session or two for a trailer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Nobody would ever get themselves in a tizzy over a simple, nondescript Instagram story, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>35 years later, Warner Bros has finally announced it’s making a <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The new sequel will be executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spielberg-call-duty-movie-activision-medal-honor-2000623436">who reportedly was denied a chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie</a>, so why not help produce a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/gremlins-2-the-new-batch-1"><em>Gremlins</em></a> movie instead?</p> <p>On November 6, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David “I’m Bad At My Job” Zaslav <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warners-gremlins-3-steven-spielberg-chris-columbus-1236419932/">announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call</a> that a third <em>Gremlins</em> movie had recently been greenlit and had some big names attached. As mentioned, Spielberg is returning to the franchise to once again be an executive producer and will be producing the sequel through his company, Amblin Entertainment. Meanwhile, the writer behind the OG 1984 <em>Gremlins</em> movie, Chris Columbus, is returning to produce and direct the flick.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gremlins-3-final-destination-screenwriters-1236371957/">As reported by<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>,</em> Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are working alongside Columbus to help write the script for <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The duo previously directed this year’s smash hit horror sequel <em>Final Destinations: Bloodlines.</em></p>

 <p>Warner Bros. has set a November 19, 2027 release date for its new <em>Gremlins</em> sequel. That is 37 years after the last <em>Gremlins</em> movie, making it a true legacy sequel.&nbsp; Arriving in theaters in 1984, the original <em>Gremlins</em> was a massive box office success. On a budget of just $15 million, the Joe Dante-directed comedy-horror movie about evil little creatures who show up after some rules are broken while taking care of a cute furry mogwai made over $150 million in the US alone.</p>

 <p>However, six years later, <em>Gremlins 2</em>, also directed by Dante, only made $41 million, was ravaged by critics and fans and basically killed the franchise. In 2023, WB produced an animated series based on the dormant property and it seems the response to that was strong enough to convince the studio that <em>Gremlins</em> is still a worthwhile franchise. Let’s hope the third movie sticks to puppets and doesn’t go full CG.</p> <p>And I hope working on <em>Gremlins 3</em> will help Spielberg get over Activision denying him the chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker-2000641681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker.1345807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TVs are getting thinner and that’s terrific for aesthetic purposes but disastrous for audio quality. Those razor-thin screens don’t have any physical room for decent speakers which means most integrated audio sounds flat, tinny and lifeless.</p>
<p>Amazon definitely noticed this gap in the market and decided to create a solution that’s largely inspired by premium brands like Bose and Samsung – except the Fire TV soundbar <em>Plus</em> costs two to three times less than comparable models from those manufacturers. At the moment, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">you can score this soundbar for just $174, down from its usual $249 sticker</a>, which puts it at an <strong>all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Audio Upgrades</h2>
<p>The Fire TV soundbar Plus is a fantastic soundbar that houses <strong>real home theater technology inside a single sleek unit</strong> sitting neatly below your television. This is a 3.1 channel system which means you get three forward-firing speakers combined with a built-in subwoofer for bass in one compact unit. The dedicated center channel <strong>takes care of dialogue specifically</strong> so that if people are talking in movies or shows, the conversations come across sharp and clear rather than being blurred with background music and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support brings 3D audio into the mix</strong>&nbsp;with the sensation that sound is moving around and above you rather than just blasting straight ahead. Action scenes feature helicopters flying overhead, atmospheric dramas rain from above, and much more. <strong>Support for DTS:X multi-dimensional audio processing</strong> for filmmakers and sound designers gives multiple ways to create immersive experiences that this soundbar can actually reproduce.</p>



<p>Special attention is given to the <strong>built-in subwoofer as most soundbars in this price range either forgo bass altogether or use a separate wireless subwoofer</strong> that requires floor space and its own power outlet. Amazon manages to house the sub directly within the chassis of the soundbar and with it, you gain deep, punchy low frequencies for everything from explosions to music and ambient rumble-all without adding another component to your setup.</p>



<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier since you only have to hook up the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. The same cable carries both audio and control signals, which means the remote from your television can change the soundbar’s volume for you with no unnecessary controller cluttering up your coffee table. Audio sync issues that plague some soundbar setups simply don’t happen here, since the HDMI connection keeps everything perfectly timed.</p>
<p>It’s compact enough to fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or the remote sensor and has an understated design that lets your entertainment take center stage. For the price, you’re getting tech and performance that’s regularly between $400-$600 from other established audio brands which makes this one of the single best value propositions in home audio at the moment. And for an all-time low price, it’s an even easier decision.</p>

<p>We’ve finally learned about Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC—Mega Dimension. It adds new Mega Evolutions and missions, but we’ve also learned that your Pokémon can go above Level 100—a series first.</p>



<p>For decades, the rule on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> has been simple: Once your Mon reaches Level 100, it has pretty much reached the peak of its powers. Yes, it will be extraordinarily strong and unbeatable, and one of them can pretty much sit on the Elite Four single-handedly, but Level 101 is out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-go-over-the-level-100-pokemon-cap-in-mega-dimension-dlc">You Can Go Over The Level 100 Pokémon Cap In Mega Dimension DLC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Level 162?? Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at the screenshot above, you can see the new Mega Baxcalibur and its mind-blowing <strong>Lv. 162 status</strong>. So, not only are we breaching Level 100 for the first time, we’re completely jumping the shark.</p>



<p>As shown by the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC trailer for Mega Dimensions</a>, Pokémon can finally breach the max level cap.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Discover-Hyperspace-Lumiose-and-New-Mega-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-Legends#:~:text=Venturing%20into%20Hyperspace%20Lumiose,strange%20events%20befalling%20Lumiose%20City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension,&nbsp;Trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city. Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, <strong>some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems like a gimmick feature exclusive to the Mega Dimension DLC. We’re not 100% how the mechanic works, but it’s likely these will only be temporary level boosts, and your Pokémon won’t be able to stay above Level 100 for the entire game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-simpsons-games.1345801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Simpsons has been a television staple since 1989, spanning over 790 episodes, a theatrically released feature film, another on the way, and a ton of video game adaptations, a few of which were genuinely great. After all, The Simpsons even invented its own in-universe video games, referenced actual video games constantly, and even went to a video game convention. But as a sitcom family featuring members that mostly spent their time at work, school, or hanging around the house, making a video game out of The Simpsons was no easy task, inspiring developers to create entire Simpsons games out of things that maybe appeared in an episode once, or just make up a game idea out of thin air, leading to some truly crazy results. Here is the weird, wild history of The Simpsons video games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t have a cow, man.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart vs. the Space Mutants (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-vs-the-space-mutants-1762431368255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first Simpsons video game is a truly bizarre one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-space-mutants">Bart vs. The Space Mutants</a> was incredibly ambitious and packed with great references to the show, even if it wasn’t exactly fun to play. The title screen played a chiptune version of the theme song over an 8-bit version of the iconic TV family and their beloved couch, fuzzy voice samples allowed Bart to say things like “Eat My Shorts,” and you could even prank call Moe the bartender from outside of his tavern. By the way, if you don’t like that chiptune cover of The Simpson’s theme song, tough luck, because it plays on loop for the entirety of some of its very long levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It being the first Simpsons video game that players could buy at a store and shove into their NES consoles made it a huge sales success, even though it was notoriously obtuse, punishingly difficult, featured unreliable and floaty platforming mechanics, and was frankly just plain odd for anyone who even had a passing familiarity with the show. Using “They Live” style glasses that Bart can wear to see invisible aliens, he’s able to traverse through the streets (while also dodging visible aliens) so he can spray paint purple objects around Springfield because the aliens... need purple objects... for intergalactic dominance... or something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a kid, Bart vs. the Space Mutants was probably the first time I realized a video game based on a TV show or movie I loved could be bad, a life lesson that the NES handed out constantly during that era. But hey, we all thought it was the coolest that Bart talked and skateboarded in the game, and we were used to pushing through brutally hard video games at the time, so we all made the best of it... even if I didn’t know a single kid who actually beat this game without using a cheat code device like the Game Genie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides, in 1991 we all knew the real best Simpsons game wasn’t in our living rooms but at the arcade across town…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Arcade Game (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/the-simpsons-arcade-game-1762431461032.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you know how fun your video game has to be to convince a ten year old boy that he should play as a stay at home mother of three with a vacuum cleaner? Really fun, and luckily <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-the-arcade-game">The Simpsons arcade game </a>was an absolute blast, especially with three of your friends huddled around it after devouring two whole pizzas at a birthday party. The early '90s arcade scene was packed with co-op sidescrolling beat ‘em up games based on things like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the X-Men, and The Simpsons fit right in, ready and eager to devour your arcade tokens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only was The Simpsons arcade game absolutely gorgeous (thanks to the brilliant artists and game developers at Konami) but it was also incredibly funny, packed with obvious and esoteric references to the show. And while its plot (rescue Maggie from Smithers because she thinks a stolen diamond is a pacifier?) didn’t make much sense, who cares? It was a great excuse to send the entire Simpsons family into the streets together to beat the crap out of bad poorly dressed henchmen, zombies, bears, gigantic Krusty the Clown balloons, and whatever else the game decides to chuck at you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately you can’t purchase this game and play it on modern video game platforms, although it was ported to consoles in 2013 before being delisted for good. You can, however, spend hundreds of dollars on a recreated Arcade 1-UP version, a thing I’ve been tempted to do dozens of times in my adult life and somehow been able to resist. 34 years later, The Simpsons arcade game is still one of the best Simpsons video games ever made, and a completely kickass beat ‘em up in its own right. I really hope Konami decides to re-release it so more people can experience this absolute classic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-simpsons-escape-from-camp-deadly-1762431601917.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile that same year, in my back pocket, the AA battery-devouring machine known as the Nintendo Game Boy got its own exclusive Simpsons game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bart-simpsons-escape-from-camp-deadly">Escape from Camp Deadly</a>. It was once again way more difficult than it had any right to be. Compared to the NES game, though, Bart’s character sprite was at least more than seven pixels tall, even if the Game Boy’s limited palette made his eyes look like he was perpetually stoned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Camp Deadly, as the name suggests, is about Bart fleeing a deranged and dangerous summer camp where people throw knives and forks during cafeteria food fights and guys that look like undercover cops try to beat you to death in a forest. And you thought summer school sucked. This game wasn’t great by any stretch, but it was satisfying enough and also had the benefit of being a portable game you could suffer through anywhere you went, from the school bus to your own terrible summer camp. And if you make it to the ending you even get to see Camp Deadly get shut down and a skunk joins your family celebration, because why not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart vs. the World (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-world-1762431713983.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Acclaim’s second Simpson’s NES game in the same year was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-world">Bart vs. the World</a>, a game about Bart winning a contest that puts him on a global scavenger hunt, which is mostly just a thin excuse to drop him in international locations that have no bearing on reality, like a huge boat in China where people shoot fireworks at kids, and the North Pole’s frozen river - a dream vacation of every child wearing a t-shirt and shorts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bart vs. the World plays like much more of a standard platforming game than vs. the Space Mutants did, and the end result is a slightly-better-but-still-not-great game. But hey, you at least can turn into Bartman and fly around, there are minigames to break things up between levels, Moe the Bartender tries to kill you with beers, and you can throw pies in the faces of Smithers and Mr. Burns for an uncomfortably long stretch of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart's House of Weirdness (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/barts-house-of-weirdness-1762440191997.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Somehow the <em>fifth</em> Simpsons video game released in 1991, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-barts-house-of-weirdness">Bart’s House of Weirdness</a> brings Konami back into the picture for an MS-DOS game (and if you know what that means, you should schedule a colonoscopy) that once again pits Bart against a bunch of stuff in Springfield that is trying to kill him. Or should I say “uncool” him, since the game’s health bar is actually a cool meter that goes down depending on how much you get hurt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being named Bart’s House of Weirdness, most of the game is actually spent outside of Bart’s house doing the usual Simpson’s video game stuff like fighting aliens or looking at long, awkward poses on loading screens. Overall it’s a pretty good looking game and use of the license in general (although the theme song cover here is completely unhinged) even if it's nowhere near the same level of quality as Konami’s other Simpson’s game that year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart vs. The Juggernauts (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-1762431860314.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The year 1992 brought us a trio of new Simpsons games, the most unhinged of them being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bart-vs-the-juggernauts">Bart vs. The Juggernauts</a>, a parody of the hit late '80s/early '90s competitive strongman show, American Gladiators, now set in Springfield. Oh, and it’s hosted by resident surly news anchor Kent Brockman and local therapist Marvin Monroe, both of which assume no legal responsibility for the public beating that Bart is about to endure. Bart Simpson - canonically a fourth grader - takes on numerous Juggernauts, hulking behemoths who want to pulverize him for cash and prizes. So yes, exactly the kind of lawsuit factory that infamous Simpsons lawyer Lionel Hutz would’ve loved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the premise is deranged, the writing is genuinely witty and sharp, with all of the adults fully aware that this televised tournament is a reckless and dangerous thing to throw kids into, especially the level where Bart has to punch and jump kick a grown woman at Moe’s Tavern, a dive bar full of cheering alcoholics. Oh, and that’s when he’s not jousting against a different grown up to see who can push their opponent into a pit of toxic sludge down at Mr. Burns’ power plant, which is exactly how The Joker once became a thing. Bart vs. The Juggernauts is essentially a minigame collection strung loosely together lby cutscenes, and while the game as a whole can feel kind of hit or miss, it’s a unique take on the source material. Plus, it ends with Bart winning his very own Truckasaurus for his family to drive home with, and really, how can anyone be mad at that?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Krusty's Fun House (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/krusty-fun-house-1762431982888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After several Simpsons games starring Bart were released back to back (with many, many more to come) it was time to send in the clowns and give Krusty his own video game. Well, sort of. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/krustys-super-fun-house">Krusty’s Fun House</a> was technically a reskin of an Amiga game called Rat Trap that Acclaim decided to throw Krusty and some other Simpsons sprites into, sort of like how Super Mario characters took over the Japanese game Doki Doki Panic when it was released in the US. If you’ve ever played Lemmings or the Mario vs Donkey Kong games, you’ll quickly recognize that Krusty’s Fun House plays similarly but with a slightly darker outcome for the tiny herdlings: that’s because the player has to lure them into large machines where they’ll be smashed to bits. So probably not quite what you’d expect from a Krusty the Clown game but at the same time <em>exactly </em>the kind of thing you’d expect Krusty the Clown to do in his free time, so hey, why not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bartman Meets Radioactive Man (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bartman-and-radioactiveman-1762436202775.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Krusty was dealing with diseased vermin infestations, Bart was busy tackling other potentially deadly health code violations in 1992’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bartman-meets-radioactive-man">Bartman Meets Radioactive Man</a>, which finally features Bart’s superhero alter-ego Bartman as a permanently playable character rather than a temporary power-up. Unfortunately, it’s marred by the same floaty platforming that plagued the previous Acclaim Simpsons games, and while the Bartman flying levels mix up the pacing a bit, it mostly lands in the middle of that all-too-common licensed NES game ditch of way too hard and not very fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The entirety of Bartman Meets Radioactive Man is set in locations that have nothing to do with any Simpsons episodes and feature little to no Simpsons references or characters at all, so it’s not even like it’s worth pushing through if you’re a Simpsons fan. In hindsight it’s pretty crazy how much Bartman stuff was out there by 1992 considering that character didn’t exactly have a huge presence on the show at the time, and I say that as someone who once successfully begged his parents to buy him a Bartman action figure. God I loved that thing. The Bartman video game, not so much.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart's Nightmare (1993)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/barts-nightmare-1762436333435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On to the year 1993, where Bart Simpson is once again starring in an absolute fever dream of a Simpsons game, although this time that’s finally a deliberate choice. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-barts-nightmare">Bart’s Nightmare</a> opens with Bart passing out face first into his homework and waking up in an imaginary hellscape where all of the pages have flown out of his bedroom window and on to a chaotic fantasy version of the streets of Springfield. While dodging obstacles with a jumping sound effect that sounds like a sick cat about to retch, Bart must collect his missing homework pages, triggering one of several random doors that lead to even crazier nightmares. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind one door there’s a Godzilla-inspired stage where Bart has to dodge a version of Mothra that looks like his mom (Margethra, I guess?) Behind another, a side-scrolling shoot ‘em up style level where Bartman takes down missiles and Krusty balloons with his trusty slingshot. There’s even a stage where Itchy and Scratchy try to kill Bart with hammers and bazookas while sentient vacuum cleaners tear across the carpet. Does any of this make any sense? No, and nightmares seldom do, so hey, just roll with it and try to get an A+ as your final score so the whole family can stare in awe at your hard work and dedication (although it’s not entirely clear if Bart didn’t just write that grade on the paper himself.)</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness (1993)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/itchy-scratchy-mini-golf-1762436489017.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, it’s about time that Itchy &amp; Scratchy - The Simpsons’ ultra-violent parody of Tom &amp; Jerry - got their very own video game, although a side-scrolling mini golf game was probably not exactly what most fans expected at the time. Still, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/itchy-scratchy-in-miniature-golf-madness">Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness</a> manages to be ultra-violent, which is especially funny for a Game Boy game rated "E for everyone." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Scratchy’s job to whack the ball over various obstacles and into the hole while managing challenging platforming sequences and collecting weapons he can use to blow up, maim, and straight up chop in half his resident nuisance animal, Itchy, who repeatedly makes it a point to annoy and harm him. Somehow this is all Krusty’s fault for reasons that are never clearly explained and ultimately don’t matter, because the end result was unique, especially when you consider your typical minigolf game at the time didn’t involve throwing knives or hitting a mouse so hard his eyeballs fly off of his face and into the 18th hole.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart &amp; the Beanstalk (1994)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-and-the-beanstalk-1762436544108.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, I promise this is the last Acclaim-developed Simpsons game for the original Nintendo Game Boy. I swear. 1994 was when The Simpsons was right in the middle of its peak of popularity, so obviously the best place to set the next video game starring ‘90s cool kid Bart Simpson was the 1700’s royalty-free British fairy tale, Jack and the Beanstalk. Wait, what? Acclaim, a publisher clearly set on riding The Simpsons license until the wagon wheels fell off, once again gave Bart a short and floaty platforming game for the Nintendo Game Boy, this time a retelling of the classic story of a poor kid selling his family’s cow to make money and then spending said money on a magical bean that grows into a towering beanstalk leading to a giant’s castle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no logical explanation for why any Simpson would be doing any of this unless some ‘90s video game executive heard Bart’s oft-repeated “don’t have a cow, man” line and decided a fable about a family selling their cow was a perfect fit. That’s the best I can do here. Let me know if you’ve got a better idea. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bart-and-the-beanstalk">Bart &amp; the Beanstalk</a> is once again a strange fit for the license and, outside of the giant looking like Homer and a cloud shaped boss looking like Mr. Burns, there’s not much here for Simpsons fans... although it does finally bring closure to Acclaim’s prolific and peculiar run of Game Boy exclusive Simpsons games. Rest in peace.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Virtual Bart (1994)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/virtual-bart-1762436972691.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t really get any more 1990s than Homer voice actor Dan Castellaneta yelling “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtual-bart">Virtual Bart</a>" over the intro of a 16-bit video game. See, in 1994 virtual reality seemed like the coolest concept in the world, even if nobody really knew what it meant and it was a label thrown around for anything from video games to just... being on the internet and doing virtual stuff like reading websites. The idea of putting on a futuristic helmet or special glasses and suddenly being whisked away to a simulated 3D world was every kid’s dream, and with very early VR experiences starting to trickle out in arcades, and movies like Demolition Man and the Lawnmower man showing their various uses, combining VR and Bart Simpson made a ton of sense if you were a marketing guy trying to get a kid to buy a video game. That said, Virtual Bart is mostly a randomized mini-game collection where Bart does various things every kid thought was cool, like watersliding, dirt bike riding, throwing eggs at teachers, and uhh, turning into a pig and escaping a canned ham factory. Yeah, that kind of stuff. Cool stuff kids love. Virtual stuff. Cool.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game (1995)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/itchy-scratchy-game-1762437066990.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Back for another ultra violent action platforming game (this time without any pesky mini-golf to get in the way) 1995’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-itchy-scratchy-game">The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game</a> lets you play as Itchy to exact revenge on that horrible cat who is always trying to kill you. The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game feels like someone said “What if we made a much slower and much worse Sonic the Hedgehog game with horrendous controls and level design and we gave it a soundtrack that sounded like people hitting loose floorboards with hammers the whole time. That would suck, right? Who cares, kids won’t know it sucks, just ship it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we did know. We knew then and we know now and this game was so bad that nobody made another Itchy &amp; Scratchy game for nearly 15 years after this. More on that later, but until then, it’s time we say goodbye to Acclaim’s seemingly endless run of mostly-not-great Simpsons video games and kick the license over to a bunch of new publishers. Thank for your service Acclaim, you may go away now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Cartoon Studio (1996)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-cartoon-studio-1762440072105.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Watching Simpsons cartoons is great, but have you ever wanted to make your own? Turns out it’s really hard but still very funny if you got silly, creative, or weird enough with it, which was pretty much a given in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-cartoon-studio">The Simpsons Cartoon Studio</a> for PC and Mac. Hot off the heels of “build your own cartoon” programs like Spider-Man Cartoon Maker and Felix the Cat's Cartoon Toolbox, The Simpsons Cartoon Studio lets you layer tons of different characters, effects, and sounds over various Simpsons settings to create hilarious and surrealist short films. It’s not really a “game” in that it doesn’t have a defined ending or scoring system, since creative expression is the whole point, but it still manages to yield some very fun and stupid results. Also, I’m completely convinced that several movie directors working today cut their teeth by editing short films in these '90s PC animation programs based on children’s cartoons. Just my theory, though. I have no proof.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield (1997)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/virtual-springfield-1762439989398.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1997 and while The Simpsons grip on pop culture is starting to loosen, excitement over the nebulous concept of all things “virtual” continued to climb, giving us the best-looking Simpsons game that had been released up until that time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-virtual-springfield">Virtual Springfield</a> decided to make the Simpsons home town the main character, allowing players to explore it through a device the game calls a “Virtual Reality Viewthingy,” which allows a first-person view of various Simpsons characters, settings, and gags, simply by pointing and clicking around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by far the greatest thing that Virtual Springfield gave the world is the promotional contest tied to it, where one lucky winner would become the owner of a real-life recreation of The Simpsons house built in Henderson, Nevada. Not only did they actually build the iconic house inside and out, but the contest winner refused the prize, accepting cash instead, and the local HOA hated its vibrant colors and decorations for looking out of place in the neighborhood, so it got stripped of all its Simpsons charm and repainted to a much more muted beiges and browns, none of which has stopped diehard Simpsons fans from traveling from around the world to visit it to this day. That story completely blew my mind, so thank you to Virtual Springfield and the adjacent Simpsons contests happening that year for bringing it all to life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Bowling (2000)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-bowling-1762439876538.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to the year 2000! You successfully survived the Y2K bug hysteria and your reward is a trackball arcade bowling game starring The Simpsons. It’s a bit odd that it took nine years of Simpsons video games to get one based on bowling, considering how much of a presence bowling has the show (in Homer’s life, specifically, much to Marge’s chagrin.) And while seeing low-poly 3D modeled Simpsons characters is slightly disturbing, the game itself is fun enough. Like the original Konami Simpsons Arcade Game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bowling">The Simpsons Bowling</a> lives on in the recreated 1-Up Arcade Simpsons cabinet (which I’m once again trying to talk myself out of buying) so if you’re eager to track one down or get lucky enough to find one in the game room of a real bowling alley out there, you can experience it all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Wrestling (2001)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-wrestling-1762439791432.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, PlayStation owners get their first Simpsons game ever and it’s a... wrestling simulator? Uh, ok. If you thought the 3D graphics in Simpsons Bowling were jarring, get a look at this thing. Yikes. At the time, 3D wrestling games like WWF Smackdown and No Mercy were huge hits, while Simpsons popularity and general episode quality definitely started to dip a bit, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-wrestling">The Simpsons Wrestling</a> may have been some kind of hail mary hopeful situation for the franchise. Players and critics alike almost universally hated it, with IGN calling it "the most horrific demolition of a license ever." But hey, you get to punch Flanders in the face, so at least Homer probably loved it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror (2001)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/treehouse-of-horrro-1762437266933.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, you thought we were done with Game Boy Simpsons games developed by a video game publisher that once filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, only to return years later when their company trademarks were purchased and repurposed by investment groups? Well, THQ says "Hold my Duff Beer." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-night-of-the-living-treehouse-of-horror">The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror</a> is a Game Boy Color action platformer inspired by The Simpsons' tradition of annual spooky Halloween time episodes, and somehow it’s actually a pretty fun game and solid proof that The Simpsons worked better as pixel art in the early 2000s. And hey, you can even play as robot Homer as a nod to the Simpsons 1991 Frankenstein meets Wizard of Oz parody “If I Only Had a Brain.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Road Rage (2001)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-hit-and-run-1762437481387.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, a Simpsons driving simulator, or “What if they made a whole video game of that part in The Simpsons show intro where Homer drives recklessly around Springfield?” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-road-rage">The Simpsons Road Rage</a> is basically The Simpsons meets Crazy Taxi, a comparison that Sega found so striking that it actually sued EA and FOX over it before settling out of court. Developer Radical Entertainment would go on to make a much better game where you wreak havoc and destruction around Springfield a few years later, but if you could push past the frequent loading screens and unreliable hit detection, The Simpsons Road Rage was decent enough fun at the time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Skateboarding (2002)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-skateboarding-1762437577124.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again a bit behind the times on video game trend chasing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-skateboarding">The Simpsons Skateboarding</a> in 2002 attempted to take on the four Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games that had already been released at the time (the fourth just a month earlier) and sadly, it was no contest. Despite having nine playable characters and decent enough visuals, the gameplay was atrocious and The Simpsons sound bytes being played on repeat hundreds of times per stage were maddening enough to make you want to break a skateboard in half. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But don’t worry, things are about to get a whole lot better.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Hit and Run (2003)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-hit-and-run-1762438701425.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The year was 2003, and if you were playing video games at the time you might not have realized it but you were about to get what is arguably the greatest Simpsons game of all time. Around the same time, the Grand Theft Auto franchise was firing on all cylinders between GTA: Vice City and the soon to be released GTA: San Andreas, so the creators of The Simpsons Road Rage decided to expand many of the foundations they had previously built and created <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a>. A GTA inspired open-world Simpsons game, Hit &amp; Run let you steal cars, cause chaos, and explore Springfield to unlock collectibles and meet and/or beat all of your favorite Simpsons characters. This combination of GTA and the Simpsons went together like peanut butter and chocolate, and while it totally sucks that a sequel was pitched, planned, and then ultimately canceled, Hit and Run totally holds up today and has a passionate and dedicated speedrunning community collaborating to finish it as fast as humanly possible over and over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Minutes to Meltdown (2007)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/minutes-to-meltdown-1762439688162.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When The Simpsons Movie arrived in theaters in 2007, Electronic Arts published a pair of games to ride off of the hopeful success of the film, banking on nostalgia from longtime fans and newcomers alike. The first Simpsons Movie tie-in game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-minutes-to-meltdown">Minutes to Meltdown</a>, a top-down mobile game played in 30 minute sessions, the same length of time it takes to watch an episode of The Simpsons with commercials. The art style is great, looking like a long-lost isometric Sega Genesis Simpsons game, once again proving that The Simpsons often works well in pixel art. But with only three levels and some very basic puzzles, most fans bounced off this one pretty quickly. Either way, Minutes to Meltdown is officially in the abandonware category, as you can no longer legally purchase it or play it. But hey, at least now you know it once existed. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Game (2007)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-game-1762438924972.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-game">The Simpsons Game</a> was a much bigger and more ambitious swing, launching on nearly every console and handheld in 2007 and giving The Simpsons a big, fun action platformer to coincide with the release of the film. The game is broken up into 16 episodes, with each family member appearing as a playable character and a specific set of goals. The writing was fantastic and funny thanks to the direct contributions of The Simpsons writing staff, the cel shaded polygonal art style was a perfect fit, and each stage was packed with tons of nods to gaming, like references to Grand Theft Auto, The Sims creator Will Wright, Frogger, Space Invaders, and more. Unfortunately the camera was a bit hard to control and the overall game length left much to be desired. A sequel was originally planned but ultimately scrapped, so here’s hoping we see something new when the second Simpsons movie comes out in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first film.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land (2009)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/itchyscratchymobile-1762439621077.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later, EA Games published another isometric pixel art Simpsons game for mobile phones called Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land, which despite its title, doesn’t actually let you play as Itchy or Scratchy. Instead, the Simpsons family does their best to survive their local theme park, which is now overrun with deadly Itchy &amp; Scratchy robots along with a plethora of traps and hazards designed to kill them. While managing to be a bit deeper than EA’s previous Simpsons mobile game, it’s still a fairly simplistic offering that you also can’t download on your phone these days since support for it ended long ago. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Arcade (2009)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-arcade-1762439513707.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember the 1991 Simpsons Arcade game I praised near the start of this list? Well, in 2009 EA made a mobile exclusive tribute to it, or really, a spiritual successor that was missing lots of spirit. EA’s take on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-arcade">The Simpsons Arcade</a> was still a side-scrolling beat ‘em up where players pulverized various goons and Simpsons characters across Springfield, but with no local multiplayer and only Homer featured as a playable character, it missed out on much of what made the original so fun. Still, since Konami had never (and still hasn’t) ported the original arcade game to mobile, it was fun having a new take on it on the go, even if it wasn’t nearly as great.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Tapped Out (2012)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-tapped-out-1762439452759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’ve seen by now, numerous Simpsons games let you explore Springfield, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-tapped-out">The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a> let you design and build it yourself to your own liking, and the results were shockingly fun for a mobile game, even if it was occasionally plagued by the usual microtransaction nonsense. Checking in daily to unlock new building, reorganize your town layout, and go through your large pile of Simpsons villager requests was an obsession of mine while waiting for a bus or train to arrive on my morning commute, so much so that I once figured out how to build gigantic 8-bit Nintendo sprites of Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda’s Link made entirely out of Simpsons washing machines, bushes, and mailboxes. Sadly after 12 years of steady updates and content drops, the game’s support officially ended recently and it’s since been delisted from mobile stores, meaning it's a bit tricky if you want to try and play it for the first time this year. But man, when it was at its best it was really cool to carry around my own personal version of Springfield in my pocket.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Dimensions (2015)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/lego-dimensions-simpsons-1762439399129.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between amiibo, Skylanders, and more, the “toys-to-life” genre of real life physical collectibles you could scan into digital games were all the craze in 2015, and LEGO decided to get in on it big time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-dimensions">LEGO Dimensions</a> played like your typical LEGO game at the time, combining co-op action platforming and light puzzles, but instead of focusing on one franchise they decided to combine tons of them, including the Ghostbusters, DC Comics, The Goonies, Beetlejuice, and of course, The Simpsons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Real life LEGO sets corresponding to each franchise could be purchased, built, and scanned into the game to unlock in-game characters and rewards, giving us a trio of Simpsons “fun packs” featuring Homer, Bart, and Krusty. You probably already guessed, but this meant absolute hell for both collectors and anyone trying to 100% the game since it required the purchase of tons of different LEGO sets to complete it all. By 2017 the toys to life genre was completely oversaturated, sales fell short for LEGO Dimensions, and future additions were cancelled. Still, it’s pretty cool that this is the only Simpsons game on this list to give us new toys to go with it, and you can still regularly find them for pretty cheap these days, in case you’ve always wanted a tiny LEGO Homer car to put on your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, a complete history of every Simpsons video game so far, spanning several decades, consoles, handhelds, PC, and more. But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fortnite/The_Simpsons_Fortnite:_All_Details,_Skins,_Map,_and_More">The Simpsons getting added to the immensely popular multiplayer game Fortnite</a>, the show still ongoing with no plans to stop, and a Simpsons movie sequel coming in 2027, I have a feeling we’ll be getting new Simpsons games for years to come.

                <p>The worlds of Silent Hill and Castlevania have crossed over with Dead by Daylight before, but the latest collaboration between Konami and Behaviour Interactive is taking things even further into The Fog. This time, Silent Hill's Pyramid Head and Castlevania's Dracula are teaming up as The Executioner and The Dark Lord. And they aren't the only guest characters in this 2v8 battle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoxhwNgPaGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoxhwNgPaGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dead by Daylight's Silent Hill X Castlevania collaboration starts today, November 6, and extends through November 20. Both of the series' respective villains will be joined by a pair of returning heroes: Silent Hill 3's Cheryl Mason and Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. All four characters are available for free during the 2v8 battles for the duration of this event.</p><p>There are also four new outfits--one for each of the returning characters. Trevor's Legendary Outfit essentially transforms him into his descendant, Richter Belmont. Dracula's alternate look is called the Scorched Terror Outfit. Basically, it's what Dracula looks like when he's left in the sun long enough for his skin to blister and peel.</p><p>Cheryl's alternate look is the Awakened Order outfit, which features her as she "embraces a sinister ritual." As for Pyramid Head, he's a glutton for punishment with his Flayed Torturer outfit, which is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Earlier this year, Dead by Daylight had crossover collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-walking-dead-heroes-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6533018/" data-ref-id="1100-6533018">The Walking Dead's heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-hits-new-player-count-record-with-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover/1100-6532544/" data-ref-id="1100-6532544">Five Nights At Freddy's murderous animatronics</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evils-greatest-monsters-unite-in-first-look-at-new-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/1100-6529360/" data-ref-id="1100-6529360">Resident Evil characters</a>.

As of today, GTA 5's multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is included with the membership on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it was free on PS5 for a period of time.

The subscription service is available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but GTA Online is not included with GTA+ on PC, only console.</p><p>One of the perks of GTA+ is access to a library of Rockstar games, and GTA Online is just the latest. The others include GTA: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, GTA 3 - The Definitive Edition, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA: Chinatown Wars. These games are playable as long as your subscription remains active.</p><p>Beyond access to games, GTA+ gives members an in-game cash infusion of GTA$ 500,000 each billing cycle, access to in-game discounts, exclusive in-game vehicles, and special perks in GTA Online like a 100-car garage and a member-only app.</p><p>It remains to be seen what will happen with GTA Online and GTA+ when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> arrives in 2026.

This chapter explains why, and discusses how this approach is foundational for this book and the following chapters. For this, the chapter draws on perspectives from the games industry as well as research results, UN policy documents, and personal anecdotes. After reading it, you will have a framework for meaningful environmental action and you will be able to communicate it to others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Key take-aways:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A framework for understanding and evaluating sustainability efforts in your studio</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A way to think about systemic sustainability that empowers you to resist greenwashing</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stories, industry data, and research results that enable you to communicate this information to a wide variety of people in a way that connects</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-wizards-of-the-coast-exec-resurrects-canceled-game-at-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Wizards of the Coast exec resurrects canceled game at new studio</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction:">Introduction:</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a Nordic sustainability game jam I helped organize last summer, a participant introduced herself as the founder of an indie studio. Her studio had been working on games with a sustainability focus and she was excited to deepen her knowledge on the topic. I kicked off the jam with a lecture about the need for systemic approaches to sustainability instead of greenwashing, and in response, this indie founder explained that her studio had gotten funding from Meta. Her mood shifted from excitement about her studio and the jam to something more somber as she explained that yes, her team was aware that their game was part of the broader greenwashing efforts of Meta. The social media corporation, she explained, was funding smaller European game studios to fake a commitment to different areas of sustainability, mostly in order to avoid sustainability legislation from the European Union.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most centrally, Meta wanted to be able to argue for industry self-regulation instead of legal sustainability requirements for social media and digital platforms, largely so that they could continue their unsustainable practices unimpeded. She clarified that if the giant corporation really had wanted to work for systemic sustainability, then it could have put its enormous weight behind real, material, and systemic means to achieve that. Her excitement about her project visibly dimmed as she explained that their game and studio was part of the calculated greenwashing efforts of a cynical tech corporation. This was tough to see, and it left me wondering how many more game makers are feeling the same way: standing behind their game and its pro-environmental message in isolation, but also realizing that in its systemic context the game studio is even contributing to the greenwashing of a big corporation. There is just no good solution here: Not taking money from Meta to make a game they were believing in is not good either. This is a rock and a hard place, and from the perspective of a single developer, it can feel as if there is no good way of working towards meaningful sustainability.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-subsidiary-bad-brain-game-studios-is-shutting-down" target="_self" data-discover="true">NetEase subsidiary Bad Brain Game Studios is shutting down</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And indeed, we in the games industry are not satisfied with our industry’s climate change and sustainability efforts.

However, "a critical approach is essential when evaluating Big Tech’s often deceptive sustainability narratives and underscores the need for more rigorous regulatory frameworks" (Vrikki, 2024:1) in all areas, but specifically around sustainability. "disclosure legislation, international soft law and private actors’ corporate sustainability codes of conduct. Despite an abundance of norms, egregious human and environmental rights violations [...] continue."</span></p><p>Figure 1: Game Developers Conference and GameDeveloper.com (2023:24). 2024 State of the Game Industry.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The data that the Game Developers Conference (GDC) &amp; Game Developer shared here also reflects that people in the game industry are well aware of the difference in impact that a small studio can make in comparison to the tech corporations that own the platforms we create and play on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Indie studios aren’t the problem. Every indie could go carbon-negative and it wouldn’t change a thing. The real culprits are corporations like Amazon and Microsoft who run massively wasteful data centers.”"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not to say that game makers and people in the game industry have been inactive here, waiting for bigger actors to move. On the contrary, they have gotten to work: the Climate SIG of the IGDA is one example. This special interest group has been visible at GDC in presentations and workshops, has published their Environmental Game Design Playbook in 2023, and has been running game jams and regular meetings since 2021. The group has also been connecting with research and teaching on a number of intersections, for example by inviting relevant researchers into their meetings and having them write about the process &nbsp;in the excellent Ecogames book featuring a wealth of academic work on game content and climate . Members have been presenting at academic conferences like the Clash of Realities &nbsp;conference in Cologne in 2022 and been running workshops and panels at GDC .</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other examples of the game industry and academia together tackling sustainability issues include a book about the environmental footprint of the game industry with a focus on the real, material world, the Greening Games Project, which presented its final report in 2023 &nbsp;among a number of scientific publications, &nbsp;and Nordic universities have banded together to discuss how to teach about sustainability, resulting in a yearly game jam and exchange that shows students the somber reality and yet still inspires hope and creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The material reality of the games industry is dire. The significant carbon emissions and energy usage of the developers, distribution, and players are only the beginning. &nbsp;Digital games are also made possible by and in turn enable the colonial exploitation of the planet and its people &nbsp;all while normalizing designed obsolescence in the very core of our tech and cultural industries, even though there are recent signs for a move away from this approach. In a later chapter, Busch et.al. offer an extensive overview over the various sustainability crises that games and gaming are connected to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In summary: We need to radically change the ways in which we produce society on a systemic level to address the challenges of climate change. This also means that we need to take a close look at not only what messages we build into our games, but also at how we make these games. Because games and the industries they are a part of, tech and culture, are so intimately connected to the climate crisis, we also need to examine the context in which they are produced. There is already grass-roots work being done both in building organizations, collecting knowledge, and building connections between research and industry. However, if it is literally possible that entire game studios are the greenwashing of big tech corporations, even while making legitimate sustainability games, then we really need to think outside of the box to reach the kind of holistic and systemic change that we need. In the face of these challenges this chapter asks:&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"What would constitute successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry?"</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Systemic Change">Systemic Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The report Making Peace with Nature from the United Nations Environment Programme explains that the needed "Transformation will involve a fundamental change in the technological, economic, and social organization of society, including world views, norms, values and governance." &nbsp;From this perspective, if there is to be any chance to avoid climate catastrophe, climate change needs to be addressed through real, material changes in our global production systems, mechanisms of governance, and in the way we structure our economic systems and incentives. These changes need to be accompanied by cultural, societal, and normative changes, but those immaterial elements cannot stand alone. In short, we need to radically rethink how we produce society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, the fact that games are, as mentioned above, in one way or another connected to many of the biggest sustainability issues we are currently facing, might also put us in a position to create positive change in many places. Especially digital gaming could be an influential starting point for said material as well as discursive sea-change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This perspective already exists in the games industry. Taking again the data from the 2024 State of the Game Industry (GDC &amp; Game Developer, 2023), the report chooses to cite a number of very interesting quotes, for example this one:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have been diligent but there is still the silent belief that ‘first we make money, then we clean after ourselves,’ without accepting that this is pretty much the mindset that brought the global society to this state. The environmental crisis seems a much larger problem that my current company believes to be able to tackle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This shows that there already is an understanding that the climate crisis and sustainability issues need to be addressed system-wide, with actions that go beyond the level of the individual studio. The quote also calls for us to not consider sustainability as an after-though but to treat it as a priority from the start. As a takeaway here, a sustainable games industry would have to be part and object of a radical and systemic change in how it operates. This change needs to also encompass the material world and needs to extend beyond discourse and discussion.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Impeding Transformation">Impeding Transformation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the UN report also explains that "some attractive and feasible actions can impede transformation", &nbsp; and transformation here means the fundamental change to how we build society that is mentioned in the paragraph above. As a mechanism for this impediment of transformation, the report explains that "The changes that appear most feasible may be those that do not contribute to, or even impede, transformative change, for instance by retaining or even consolidating the power interests vested in the status quo (see Section 5.3)." &nbsp;Here it says that "Some individuals and organizations also have substantial stakes in maintaining the status quo. These vested interests may oppose changes that disrupt their livelihoods, market shares and future revenues." &nbsp;This is the United Nations stating two things:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1. People and groups in positions of power will obstruct meaningful and systemic climate action because it would impact their wealth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2. They can distract us from focusing on the necessary systemic change through ineffective, but enticing alternative actions, e.g. greenwashing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parts of this warning can be applied in a fairly straight-forward manner to digital games. Games are published by and played on the platforms of some of the most powerful and influential international corporations on the planet. They, at least in the short term, benefit from the continuation of the hardware race that they are currently winning. Chapter 5 will offer more pragmatic ways to think about systemic change and there we will come back to the responsibility of powerful actors and organizations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Green Washing and Individualization – Why we need Collective Action</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What are the "attractive and feasible actions [that] can impede transformation"? &nbsp;One way of understanding this formulation relates to a common narrative about climate change in both contemporary culture and games that presents it as the responsibility of individuals instead of groups and mostly a question of what we believe instead of how we collectively act. In a call for action, preceding the urgent warning of the United Nations by 20 years, Maniates &nbsp;states that "the forces that systematically individualize responsibility for environmental degradation must be challenged." This narrative positions individuals and their actions as the final and sole responsible for climate catastrophe and, importantly, individual behavioral change as the only avenue for change. It disguises material and systemic problems as exclusively issues of individual virtue and character and makes it impossible to even consider the role of the vested industrial interests that benefit from the status quo, like the fossil fuel industries. &nbsp;This raises the question of whether the individualization of climate responsibility then is not only an involuntary consequence of neoliberalism, &nbsp;but a purposeful distraction and greenwashing by the fossil-fuel industry. &nbsp; Even the concept of the "carbon footprint" is a development of the Exxon Mobile concern as a distraction, &nbsp;so that we all focus on the responsibility of each individual instead of coming together to change the world. Again: The carbon footprint, the entire metaphor, is toxic greenwashing from oil companies. This is what the UN is warning us about, the vested interests benefiting from the maintenance of the system that is destroying the planet, and that those might hinder effective and systemic climate action.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here then, the individualization of climate action can be seen as a kind of purposeful greenwashing: an attempt to create a narrative in which the systemic change of society cannot even be imagined, and so the necessary systemic and radical transformation becomes impossible to even consider. Maniates’s &nbsp;call might not have been meant to address games specifically, but it remains relevant while one of the proposed uses of games is the education of players. Research about sustainability education has shown that it is both possible and necessary to go beyond placing the responsibility for climate change at the feet of customers in a market and to address sustainability, together with the students, from a systemic and inter-disciplinary perspective. &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, games are perfectly suited to portray the workings of systems and to open them up for critical reflection in ways that other media are incapable of. &nbsp; &nbsp; Educating players to see the workings of destructive and exploitative systems and the ways in which they are implicated (and the games they are currently playing are implicated) is definitely a good start and something that we will come back to later. However, the conclusion here for defining a sustainable games industry is that it has to resist individualization and include collective and organized action. This is also something that the industry on some level already understands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Others spoke to feelings of disillusionment, frustration, and helplessness when it comes to making a positive impact on the environment—especially related to the issue of personal versus collective responsibility."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Beyond Discourse towards Material Change">Beyond Discourse towards Material Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is a good step to show, also in the content and message of the games that we make, that we must approach sustainability questions collectively and that it is counterproductive to focus on individual responsibility. This is also typically the first thing we think about when considering games and sustainability. Games as culture can change the way players think and feel about their environment and can in this way create societal change. The possibility of changing the way players see the world and to inspire them towards systemic change is valid. That said, it should not be seen as a reason to keep polluting or being part of the systems that create climate change. It is not only about making games for sustainability, but also about making games sustainably. This is a central point, and one that other authors in this book discuss from different perspectives. David ten Cate discusses the need for ecological games to also consider how they are being made as a part of an economic system and Jennifer Estaris discusses from the view of a designer how she sees the potential of games for her concept of sea change and the connections of what is in our hearts and how we act. So how can we make sure that we together also take that next step, reach beyond discourse, and collectively change our systems?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Material and Collective Change">Material and Collective Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the first planning meeting for the Nordic sustainability-themed game jam, a member of the Finnish game industry presented the work they had done to get their studio to address sustainability issues. Amazingly, and at that point ahead of their time, they included emissions by the players who were playing their game into the carbon emission calculations of their studio. These emissions during play are often one of the biggest sources of emissions related to digital games and considering these the responsibility of the studio shows an honest and real engagement for sustainability. They then bought carbon offsets from the highest-rated sellers that they could find to make up for their emissions. However, this is also where their efforts ended. First it is important to say that this is not intended as an example of a member of the game industry being naïve or doing something stupid. On the contrary, I would consider this an exemplary effort to do their part in addressing the climate crisis. That being said, it is important to also admit that, in this discursive prison of the individualization of climate responsibility that has been built in contemporary culture for decades, approaches to material change have also been only allowed to be imagined in limited ways. Here, material change starts and also ends with carbon offsets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carbon offsets have been heavily criticized for various reasons in research. Offsets frequently do not really work, binding carbon only for short periods but calculated as if the carbon would stay quasi-permanently bound, and with a lack of oversight are open for exploitation, cheating, and the continuation of the same colonial and logics that constitute the climate crisis. &nbsp; &nbsp;They even continue to perpetuate the mindset and system of trading the right to pollute, along with the mindset of individual customer responsibility that the polluting industries promote . At this point, issues with carbon offsets are so widely known, and in their worst excesses so absurd as to be funny, that they were a topic of the comedy show "Last Week Tonight" in 2022. &nbsp;At the time of writing in late 2024, we’re once again in a round of CEOs getting sued because their companies over-estimated their emission reductions by an average of 1000%. &nbsp;Here carbon offsetting is an example for the "attractive and feasible actions" that "can impede transformation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This shows that even a collective, systemic intervention like carbon trading and the offset industry can be insufficient or even something that impedes transformative change, especially if done instead of reducing energy use or a restructuring of technological infrastructure. The perspectives from the industry already share this conclusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We do some carbon offsetting, but that feels like a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. Not much is being done, or not that I know of, to address deeper issues like the energy consumption taken up with processor-intensive game development and maintaining our massive internal networks."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is why it was heartbreaking to see the honest and commendable effort of our Finnish colleague end with carbon offsets.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Thinking in &quot;Systemic Change&quot;">Thinking in "Systemic Change"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time when this happened, I was not prepared to offer real alternatives. Honestly, it would still be difficult. This speaks to how effective the individualization discourse is that we have difficulties even thinking about collective changes. Systemic change is tricky because we are used to the systems we live in, and it can be challenging to see a bigger picture. It also often requires some kind of safe space and trust to be able to pitch systemic change, because any suggestion of systemic change can frequently result in having to present and justify a ready and solved alternative system which is of course impossible to do. If the justifications that are demanded from any change and alternative are not also required from the status quo, which is currently destroying our planet to the point that the UN calls for fundamental change, then this indicates a bias towards the existing system that is likely in some way in the head of each of us, and possibly an unsafe space. This book then also tries to both offer some examples for what such change could look like, so that we can all use them in conversations and in our thinking, and it tries to grow the community of game workers who already care about this conversation and who can be this safe space for all of us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a later chapter I will offer more examples for collective, material, and systemic change that are meant to be starting points for finding new ways of meaningful climate action. This is work in progress.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But let us consider this example: Some games already offer an Eco Mode. This means that players can choose to play the game at lower performance to reduce emissions and energy costs. What if we argued, together, for legislation that required games to show the player a summary of their gaming energy use and estimated emissions at the end of each week, kind of like your phone shows you which apps drain your battery the most when it is about to die? Now we would take a first step into a conversation around the environmental responsibility of designers and players and start a competition for creating the most frugal games that get the most amazing performance out of the least amount of emissions. There could be collective achievements for players connected to the use of Eco Mode, and then at a later step, once we have built acceptance for eco modes, they could become industry default and even policy. This would be a longer process, but we have already taken the first steps and with our eyes set to collective, material and systemic change we can continue this path together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conclusion:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This chapter asked the question: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"What would constitute successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry?"</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on the discussion of industry feedback in connection to research and the reports of the United Nations, successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry would:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1. move from individual to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>collective responsibility and action</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2. go beyond the discursive towards </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>material change</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>resist greenwashing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that (purposefully) impedes transformative change and</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">4. lead to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>systemic change</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the way we produce society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the story of the indie developer working on a sustainability game with money from Meta, I would like to argue that many of us can on some level relate to their experience.

<p>So let's take a look at the new information...</p>
<h2>Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2>
<p><strong>- Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami Style Combat –</strong>Players can now enjoy the most attack techniques in the series' history and brand-new Heat Abilities in addition to fan favourites from the original Yakuza 3.</p>
<p><strong>- Ryukyu Style Combat –</strong> Rooted in Okinawan martial arts, this battle style’s base stance utilises a tinbe and rochin, a traditional shield and short spear. Simply mash or hold down the buttons to weave in flashy sai, nichogama, tonfa, tekko, nunchaku, eiku, and surujin attacks. Kiryu can power up by maxing out his gauge and activating his Dragon Boost.</p>
<p><strong>- Ability Upgrades –</strong> Kiryu's ability upgrades now give him access to his most diverse skill set to date. Complete missions and undergo training to mold Kiryu as you see fit or customise his cell phone to boost his motivation, taking his abilities to new heights.</p>

<h2>Dark Ties</h2>
<p><strong>- Mine’s Story</strong> <strong>–</strong>The year is 2007. Yoshitaka Mine had once launched a successful startup, only to be stabbed in the back by a trusted partner. Wandering Kamurocho in a drunken stupor, he witnesses a gruesome conflict between yakuza factions. After watching a subordinate of Daigo Dojima sacrifice themselves, Mine longs to discover what makes a bond transcend material gain.</p>
<p>He approaches Tsuyoshi Kanda of the Tojo Clan's Nishikiyama Family in hopes of learning more about Daigo. Kanda welcomes him in as his sworn brother and right-hand man. Working in tandem, they bring significant wealth into the family's coffers. Soon, the Tojo Clan catches wind of Mine and Kanda's actions and springs into action. As Mine and Kanda navigate their way through this crisis, Mine begins to feel a sense of kinship toward Kanda and shortly after receives a sudden invitation from Daigo Dojima.</p>
<p>-<strong>Ruthless Combat –</strong> An elegant fighting style based on shoot-boxing, players can exploit openings in their opponent's defence to deliver refined combos and beat down enemies, and dash freely through the air to overwhelm foes with unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>- <strong>Dark Awakening Mode –</strong> Mine builds up his Shackled Heart by attacking enemies and can spend it to trigger Dark Awakening, a mode that empowers Mine. Using Dark Awakening, Mine drops his facade, revealing his true ferocity and transforming his battle animations and techniques. Mine possesses many stylish, cold-blooded Heat Actions, including an all-out barrage to the face and a brutal gut punch.</p>
<p>- <strong>Ability Upgrades –</strong> Mine's upgrades refine his combat abilities, improving his techniques and unlocking mid-air Heat Actions. A number of upgrades to Dark Awakening are also available.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-finishes-what-tears-of-the-kingdom-started.1345756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though my 100-plus-hour completed save file would beg to differ, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> is an unfinished game. Think of it like Korean barbecue. Without the kimchi, rice, sprouts, or sauce, it’s just meat — tasty meat to be sure, but not a complete (or healthy) dinner. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638770/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></a> is the missing banchan in this analogy. Some of it’s delicious, some not, and though it’s not strong enough to stand on its own, if you combine it with some <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> pork belly, you get a fantastic, well-rounded meal.</p><p><em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is a hack-and-slash game (also known as a musou) that recounts Zelda’s half of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s story. Players can fight as a number of characters from Hyrule’s ancient past, like King Rauru, his scientist sister Mineru, the legendary leaders of Hyrule’s different races, and a number of mysterious and important figures including Princess Zelda herself. Combat takes place on different maps where you and up to two other characters mow down scores of weak enemies, mid-bosses, and big bosses, each defeat slowly turning the map from enemy red to ally blue.</p><p>Musou games have a reputation as mindless button mashers. But <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> layers together basic combat mechanics that wouldn’t be interesting on their own to create depth that’s simple but entertaining. Execute combos by stringing together light and heavy attacks. You can augment those basic combos further by sprinkling in item attacks, special abilities, and powerful sync strikes, which let you pair up with an ally for a slick-looking, health-bar melting, enemy clearing ultimate attack.</p><p>Instead of just whaling on minions and bosses, I have to think about how I fight. If I use Zelda’s arrow of light ability carelessly, it won’t be ready in time when I need to counter an enemy’s special aerial attack. If I spend too much time in a battle playing Zelda, ignoring my other teammates who I can swap to at any time, they won’t have built up their special meters enough for a sync strike. To be sure, this ain’t <em>Silksong</em> levels of complexity (or difficulty), but it’s just enough to keep me pleasantly engaged.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074">the map that I hated from <em>Age of Calamity</em></a> is back, once again littered with glowing markers all flashing for your attention. There are the main story and side missions where all the fighting happens, and those are fine. But every little piece of character progression is denoted with its own individual icon. If you want to upgrade Zelda’s health, there’s an icon on the map for that, same for expanding her combo string. Expand that across every single character, (I’m currently up to eight but there are rumors of anywhere between 14 and 16 playable characters) and you’ve got a map that:</p><div><ol><li><span>Looks like it has way more stuff going on than it does</span></li><li><span>Immediately drives you insane when you look at it</span></li></ol></div><p><em>Breath</em> and <em>Tears</em> have exceedingly busy maps too, but in those games icons indicate that whatever is there — a shrine I’ve discovered or a shop — is a valuable place that I can revisit if I need to. In this game, outside of the handful of necessities like the weaponsmith and training center, those icons represent “quests” that strain the definition of the term. There’s no task to undertake or requirement to fulfill — you get the materials, often already in your inventory, and turn ’em in. It’s maddening and makes you feel like half the game is just marking off a shopping list.</p><p>Like <em>Age of Calamity</em> before it, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> does a fantastic job of bringing elements from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and adapting them to the musou format. Any character can use Zonai devices like bombs or rockets to do some damage, and even the weirder, less martially inclined ones like the fire hydrant or fan have their uses. Investigating out-of-place-looking things reveals Koroks, some characters can fuse monster parts to their weapons for extra oomph, and you can use food and other materials to temporarily enhance your stats. Crossover games like this often suffer because they’re little more than so much of a franchise’s lipstick on a musou pig. But<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> does the work to convince you that this hack-and-slash formula fits in a universe and genre it wasn’t originally designed for.</p><p>The story fits too. Though I enjoyed <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, something that diminished the game was its treatment of Princess Zelda. Early trailers, with her standing side by side with Link, torch in hand as they investigated ruins, convinced me that she would feature more prominently than she did in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. Instead, Nintendo immediately isekai’d her, only for her to appear briefly in cutscenes and at the very end as essentially the Master Sword delivery mechanism. They made the Princess of Hyrule into the literal Latin-derived definition of a vagina, and I’ve quietly carried a blood feud ever since.</p><p>In <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, we see Zelda go on the journey I had hoped to see in <em>TotK</em>. We get to see her fight, fail, and learn as she comes into her powers as a priestess of time. She is finally a capable participant in the action around her rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">magical Macguffin</a> that drives it. While Link was using the Ultrahand ability to cobble together <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732888/tears-of-the-kingdom-builds-crafting-wildest">Korok death machines</a>, Zelda was, very literally, studying the blade.</p><p>And I like that though Zelda is the main character, her allies get their due as well. I enjoyed King Rauru and his wife, Queen Sonia, being so cute using their respective powers to fight together while calling each other “dear” and making heart eyes mid-battle. Calamo, an adventurous little Korok, might be the MVP of the squad, but as I continue through the story I worry his companion, the mysterious Construct, will prove to be just some version of Link.</p><div><p>While Link was using the Ultrahand ability to cobble together Korok death machines, Zelda was, very literally, studying the blade</p></div><p>The very nature of a musou requires a deep cast of characters to play as. And rather than have everyone but Zelda and King Rauru exist as mere set dressing, the developers at Koei Tecmo smartly used <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>to tell other characters’ stories. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are as loved as they are for their vast, lifelike worlds.

The next mainline installment is probably a long way off, and I doubt we’re coming back to this version of Hyrule. But rather than leave fans hungry, Nintendo fed us with what is essentially a sequel less than two years later that is different enough to be interesting, familiar enough to not seem alienating, and with a canon story that will make the lore sickos like me happy.</p><p><sub><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> launches November 6th for Nintendo Switch 2.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom]]></content:encoded>

I'm about an hour into Whiskerwood, the new city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> from Minakata Dynamics and publishers Hooded Horse, and I've already made an absolute mess of my coastline. A clever and charismatic hybrid of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>, Robin Jarvis novels and the settlement of North America, Whiskerwood puts you in charge of some mice building colonies on cuboid islands. The islands are lovely so far, their Minecrafty nooks and crannies crying out to be decked with gardens and windmills and cobblestone paths. But you've got taxes to pay, so the first thing you do is sink a bunch of mineshafts at random, scooping out coal and copper for the literal fat cats back at court. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
My island town currently looks like it's been attacked by termites, though I'm trying to instigate some Cosiness by populating the bedraggled shore with nice chubby cottages. I've had to abandon my grand plans for a dockfront cafe for the moment, but perhaps we can circle back to the gentrification stuff once I've stripped the caves of gold and hacked down all the trees.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to pay your taxes - shucking off the feline yoke appears to be one of the endgame possibilities in Whiskerwood. But keeping those tabby tyrants happy has benefits in the shape of new building blueprints and other resources, while also decreasing the likelihood of royal warships showing up to whip your population into submission. You can also turn in partial tax shipments, but you won't earn any blueprints from these, and you'll lose a point or two of moggy approval each time.
</p><p>
I think Whiskerwood could be very good. It's familiar in many ways, but the faintly satirical cat-and-mouse premise puts a different spin on the business of extracting resources, keeping workers happy, and expanding or upgrading your dominions. It's also pretty intricate. All your mice have traits like Slow or Patient or Good Teacher, which affect how willing they are to, for example, work emergency shifts, or sleep outside at night. They have guild specialisms and accompanying strengths and weaknesses - there's a guild of heavy-duty manual labourers who can carry more stuff but also need more food. 
</p>
<p>
There are questions of terrain to consider when setting up farms and foraging stations: certain crops favour higher altitudes, others want to grow underground. You've got to think about keeping your squeakers warm during the winter, and supplying them with fine clothes and other luxuries once you've dealt with basic needs. Lots to pick at, indeed - and later on, there's the prospect of Whiskerwood going full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> once you've unlocked relevant technologies. If you think my island looks dystopian right now, just wait till I've deluged it in conveyor belt spaghetti and started hollowing out mountains for storage. We'll make a Dunwall out of this place yet.</p>
<p>If I have a broad criticism, it's that I'm not sure the game's anthropomorphic take on colonisation includes any equivalents for indigenous people. Based on the little I've played, it's all about pioneers wrangling with their masters overseas, operating across a species split that is probably more of a metaphor for social class than race or ethnicity. The islands appear devoid of life besides plants before you arrive. If this is to be an allegory, I'd like the game to think harder about the fantasy of unspoilt, "virgin soil".
</p>
<p>
Again, Whiskerwood is out in early access today. It'll stay there "for a year, but that could change depending on how the design develops with player feedback," according to Minakata Dynamics. Everything mentioned on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">the Steam page</a> is apparently in the game now, but the 1.0 release "will include additional quests, more goods and production chains, additional tech tree options, additional buildings, and additional mechanics pertaining to rebellion, combat, and the sea." I'm tempted to conclude with another upbeat mouse pun, but I don't want to sound cheesy.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Bots System Explained by Lead Producer]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s lead producer has revealed how bots work in the game. </p>



<p>Bots in Battlefield 6 have been a subject of conversation since the open beta days, with some players annoyed about the frequency of bots and others happy to have some non-sweaty lobbies. The title also added a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough mode</a> recently, which adds 32 bots in each match. Now the developers have revealed how BF6 bots actually work. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-only-appear-for-these-reasons">Battlefield 6 Bots ‘Only’ Appear for These Reasons</h2>



<p>The lead producer for Battlefield 6, David Sirland, revealed what criteria need to be met for bots to enter and leave lobbies. Sirland’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) was a lengthy thread intended to clarify the confusion surrounding bots in BF6. The lead producer revealed that bots will enter regular playlists “only under these conditions: players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)”. When that happens, bots will enter to “fill the server to the necessary limit.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bots enter the game on regular playlists ONLY under these conditions: <br>– players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)<br>At that point, the bots fill the server to the necessary limit to start the game</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland adds that there should be 24 players per side, he believes, for “CQ for ex”. This allows players to battle against bots instead of waiting in line. While they are playing, “other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist – will join this server (as it has you on it).” Whenever a new player joins the lobby, a bot will leave, and when the lobby is filled with 24 players, it will no longer be seeded with bots. The rest of the slots are left for other players as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-alternative-for-bots-in-battlefield-6-is-waiting-possibly-forever">The Alternative for Bots in Battlefield 6 is Waiting “Possibly Forever” </h2>



<p>If the developers do not use this Battlefield 6 bots system, the other alternative is “full on waiting (possibly forever)” to play on your preferred playlists in regions with low populations to fill a server. Moreover, players need to stay with the bots for the server to fill with regular players.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The alternative to doing this, would be full on waiting (possibly forever) to play on the playlist of your choice in regions with low population. <br>but to fill a server (the first in the region) – you need to stay with the bots. <br>if you keep leaving because: 1: you see bots</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036848511398177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland concluded, stating that they can and will “can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in” for Battlefield 6. Lastly, there are also “onboarding bots” which are used in specific game modes for new players. However, these are different from seeded bots as they “stick around and populate a big chunk of the total players on each team.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s most frustrating challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-frustrating-challenges-fixed-or-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been fixed or greatly reduced</a>. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies across all platforms</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Playing NBA 2K26 might be a way for some NBA players to unwind, but Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell utilized the game another way. The six-time All-Star was motivated to put up 46 points on November 5 after he said "this kid pissed me off" while playing the basketball game online earlier in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with 46 points, Mitchell had eight assists and four rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers. When asked about the performance, he noted taking inspiration from an online multiplayer encounter in NBA 2K26, according to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-donovan-mitchell-motivation-video-game-heckler-46-point-night/">CBS Sports</a>.

He called me washed up, he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn't seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, 'Alright, we'll see.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Mitchell ended the story by stating that his 46-point performance "was for that kid or grown man" and that he appreciates "whoever that was" in the video game.

                <p>Square Enix unveiled a bold strategy that could have far-reaching implications for the games industry, as the Japanese publisher aims to use generative AI to automate 70% of game QA and debugging by 2027.</p><p>After releasing its financial results, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a progress report</a> on the company's medium-term business plan. On page five of the 20-page presentation, Square Enix announced a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo to research ways of "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies."</p><p>Titled "Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology Using Generative AI," the project features a research team of more than 10 members from both the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory and Square Enix. The goal is to "automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" by using automation technology to improve QA efficiency and operations. Through this R&amp;D, Square Enix hopes to "establish a competitive advantage in game development."</p><p>AI has become a hotly contested topic in games and beyond. Many developers and publishers have mixed opinions on the technology, with some saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">it should be embraced</a> and others claiming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">it poses legal risks</a>. It's not used everywhere; Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">won't use generative AI</a> despite its publisher, Krafton Inc., <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">going all in on the technology</a>. However, it's still being pushed onto developers, with EA wanting its employees to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">think of AI as a "thought partner"</a> while training it on their work.</p>

Series X|S and PC, but that's not all. Microsoft is bringing the game to PlayStation for the first time, and fans on Sony's system don't have to wait. Halo: Campaign Evolved will debut day and date on PS5 with the other versions in 2026. There were rumors and rumbling of Halo on Switch 2, but Microsoft has not yet made any announcements about that.</p><h2 id="Game_Pass">Game Pass</h2><p>Like all of Microsoft's other first-party games, Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch into Xbox Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_guns_and_prequel_missions"><strong>New guns and prequel missions</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There are nine new weapons coming to the Halo: CE remake, including the energy sword, which was equipped by enemies in the original version but couldn't be used by the player. As for the new missions, these are prequel missions featuring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a "brand-new arc" that takes place before the events of the story you already know.</p><p dir="ltr">Another significant update is that players can hijack enemy vehicles and drive the Wraith--this was not possible in the original version of the game, and was introduced in Halo 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also look forward to a "campaign remix" feature that allows players to take on any missions they want with a series of modifiers, or Skulls, to alter the experience with things like random weapons and enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">On the social side, the Halo: CE remake includes two-player split-screen co-op on console (not available on PC) or four-player online co-op. There is cross-play support and shared progressions between console and PC.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945" data-ratio="0.5607476635514" data-width="1177" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Halo: Campaign Evolved's new visuals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Sprint"><strong>Sprint</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In what may be a controversial change, the Halo: CE remake includes sprinting, which is something the early Halo games did not have. The lack of sprint is a defining feature of the older Halo games and something that players feel fondly for. Others, however, may be excited about sprinting and bringing the game up to modern standards. Sprint can be disabled if players want to do that.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="_Reborn__visuals"><strong>"Reborn" visuals</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is promising a suite of updates and upgrades to the classic game. The company claims <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-has-every-asset-getting-attention/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">"every asset"</a> from the original was improved upon for the remake.</p><p dir="ltr">"Battle through the original missions, newly rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding, refined to keep the pace moving without losing the wonder, tension, or heroism of the original," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios promises that the game’s environments have been "reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations." The soundtrack, too, has been remastered, with Halo Studios promising "greater immersion." The primary cast, presumably including Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) is back, and they recorded new lines for the remake.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Unreal_Engine_5"><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong></h2><p>After building Halo: Infinite with a proprietary engine called Slipspace, the developers at Halo Studios shifted to Unreal Engine 5 for future Halo titles, including Halo: Campaign Evolved. This was largely seen as a positive, as the old engine had legacy code that was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-could-be-making-the-jump-from-slipspace-to-unreal-engine-report/1100-6507973/" data-ref-id="1100-6507973">added more complexity for developers</a>. Switching to Unreal Engine 5 was also seen as a positive for recruitment, as Epic's engine is one of the most widely used in the video game industry.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_everyone_likes_the_changes"><strong>Not everyone likes the changes</strong></h2><p>While Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is a big believer in the Halo: Campaign Evolved package and said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">the game warms his heart</a>, another original developer has some reservations. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Jaime Griesemer blasted some of the changes.</a></p><p>Griesemer lamented the trailer's sequence where the Warthog vehicle moved past obstacles that were placed in its path to prevent players from being able "to steamroll the Hunters." "When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters," Griesemer said. "But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame."</p><h2 id="AI_">AI?</h2><p>Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technologies and systems, so many wondered if the company used AI or generative AI on Halo: Campaign Evolved. The company has neither confirmed nor denied this, but said its staffers were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">not <em>required</em> to use genAI for Halo: Campaign Evolved.</a></p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," Microsoft said.</p><p>Executive producer Damon Conn and Game director Greg Hermann spoke about the development of Halo: Campaign Evolved. When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p><p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, saying that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><h2 id="No_multiplayer">No multiplayer</h2><p>As stated, Halo: Campaign Evolved has no multiplayer support beyond the online and local co-op for the campaign. There is no head-to-head multiplayer. If players want that, they can boot up Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which includes multiplayer support for a range of titles, including Halo: Combat Evolved. The game is not available on PlayStation, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_the_first_remake_and_maybe_not_the_last"><strong>Not the first remake and maybe not the last</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Microsoft released a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved back in 2011 Xbox 360 via Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. The game featured updated graphics and online multiplayer support for head-to-head matches, while it also gave players the ability to toggle between old and new graphics with the press of a button.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is included with Halo: The Master Chief Collection, a compilation package featuring six Halo games. In addition to the anniversary edition of the first Halo game, the package includes Halo 2: Anniversary as well, with campaign and multiplayer support.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a leaker, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-2-and-3-are-also-getting-campaign-evolved-style-remakes-leaker-claims/1100-6535856/" data-ref-id="1100-6535856">Halo 2 and Halo 3 are also set to receive campaign-only remakes</a> sometime in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_the_only_new_Halo_game"><strong>Not the only new Halo game</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In addition to Halo: Campaign Evolved, Microsoft is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/">new live-service Halo game</a>. Microsoft previously that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, so it may just be a matter of time before Microsoft officially announces the next game to follow Halo: Infinite. That game, released in 2021, was not the success that Microsoft envisioned, and developer Halo Studios underwent a major reorganization after it released.</p>

		<p>Dead By Daylight’s 2v8 mode is back for a limited time and it will feature two iconic franchises. The Silent Hill x Castlevania crossover will see Pyramid Head and Dracula team up to hunt down the survivors. As mentioned this is going to be a limited time run, starting today and ending on November 20th. You can see the character designs in the trailer below.</p>

<p>This is the fifth time the 2v8 mode has been added to Dead By Daylight, with previous entries featuring characters from the likes of Resident Evil, Scream’s Ghost Face, and The Oni. Dead By Daylight is still one of Behaviour Interactive’s main focuses having cancelled Project T last year, but the team is also working on publishing Blight: Survival, which is being developed by Haenir Studio. Blight: Survival is a PvE survival game set in the medieval era where players face off against monsters and men. A small teaser for that was released last week.</p>

		<p>Kiborg developer Sobaka Studios is switching genres with its next game, moving from a roguelite beat ’em up to a party game that stars chickens. Chicken Chicken will see up to eight players compete against each other online in a variety of challenges to come out on top. A demo is being released today on Steam and Epic Game Store, which will have three of the events players will face off against each other in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chiken Chiken - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ9yOX1mDi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We come from a background of dark, violent action games like&nbsp;KIBORG, so&nbsp;Chicken Chicken&nbsp;might seem a bit unusual,”</em> said Dmitry Kachkov, Head of Sobaka Studio. <em>“But when you feel the pain of reaching the top of the mountain in Climbing Up…and someone hits you with a rocket launcher and sends you all the way to the bottom, you will understand.”</em></p>
<p>The list of the events available in the Chicken Chicken demo are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cars – players will race against each other to collect seed bags and deliver them to a giant chicken at the top of a mountain.</li>
<li>Climbing Up – players are tasked with climbing up a mountain made of old buildings while evading cannons dotted around the map, and rockets from the launchers other players can pick up.</li>
<li>Swamp – the one team game in this demo where two teams are tethered to a giant chicken and attempt to catch flies. Breaking the tether or falling into the swamp are two issues that need to be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chicken Chicken is due to release in 2026. In our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/">Kiborg</a>, Adrian wrote, <em>“Too much of my time with Kiborg was spent thinking how much more fun I’d be having if the game dumped the roguelite elements and just went full old-school third person action brawler. So many of its failings could be ignored in that form. Instead, Kiborg is a slightly underwhelming rougelite that looks like it should be far more fun that it is.”</em></p>

<p>So as part of this, Square Enix is looking to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI, with hopes to "improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development".</p>
<p>The partnership is currently comprised of "researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory UTokyo, and engineers from the SQUARE ENIX group", resulting in a team of over ten members.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4397d300ab87"><a title="SE Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4397d300ab87/se-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this decision will likely be met with mixed reception from fans. On the one hand, QA is said to be a tedious task, but ultimately utilising more and more AI is just going to result in more job losses. And who knows just how accurate AI will prove to be when diagnosing issues? It's a tricky one.</p>
<p>Square Enix's announcement comes just after EA launched a new partnership with Stability AI to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>EA had presumably predicted the negative response to this announcement, and stressed that human creators will still be the driving force at the company, stating that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream".</p>

Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is shutting down yet another studio that was working on a game that, likely, won’t see a release. In a post on social media, studio head Sean Crooks announced that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors on November 17 after the parent company pulled funding. </p>



<p>That just so happens to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-is-closing-one-of-its-studios-after-just-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same day as another NetEase studio</a>, Fantastic Pixel Castle, will be closed.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Crooks said that the closure comes despite “best efforts” to find a new partner for the studio and its game.</p>



<div><p><strong>“Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft,”</strong> he said. <strong>“What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</strong></p><p><strong>“The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.”</strong></p></div>



<p>Bad Brain Game Studios was formed in May 2023 with Crooks, who was a producer on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, at the helm. The studio has been working on a game known as Midnight Riders, which was set to be open world action-adventure game with a 1980’s aesthetic. You can check out the game’s sizzle reel below, courtesy of Crooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>An Update on Bad Brain Game Studios</p><p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17th.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter,&nbsp;the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out — we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></div>
