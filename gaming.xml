								<p>Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like <em>Nintendogs,</em> where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a touchscreen.</p>

								<p>Now, we mostly take them for granted, but prior to the arrival of the first DS in 2004, the idea of a touchscreen was, for many people (myself included), something out of science fiction. The screens I was used to being around — televisions, computer monitors, MP3 players — definitely were <em>not</em> for touching. And commercial devices like Apple’s Newton, with its handwriting tech, were financially out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>But the DS was something different. As the successor to the Game Boy, it was more of a toy than a piece of high-end tech. It took the basics of a traditional gaming handheld and doubled the screens, stacking two displays on top of each other and sticking a hinge in the middle so that you could fold it shut like a book. The most important part was the bottom screen, which could respond to touch via a fingertip or the included stylus.</p>

								<p>The oddball design of the DS made it approachable. Despite the touchscreen, it was <em>just </em>familiar enough thanks to an array of physical controls, and it had two cartridge slots so you could still bring along your old Game Boy Advance carts. One look and it was clear this gray, clamshell brick was meant for gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">But it was also pretty freakin’ weird</a>.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>In typical Nintendo fashion, the company didn’t just introduce a new control method — it also went ahead and showed you its possibilities. Some of the bestselling DS games are ones that wouldn’t have been possible without that touchscreen. <em>Nintendogs</em> captivated players because of how natural it felt to rub your little pup’s head with a finger or play catch by virtually flinging a frisbee as you did your best to take care of a small group of dogs. Meanwhile, the <em>Brain Age</em> series — a collection of puzzles designed to work out your mind — showed how intuitive handwriting recognition could be for games like sudoku. Hell, <em>Brain Age</em> had millions of people doing <em>math problems for fun</em>. The company also snuck touch elements into its biggest franchises, so you could fight in a new way in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> or tap through even more bizarre minigames in <em>WarioWare</em>.</p>

								<p>Even better, because the DS was such a hit — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">the Switch may be a massive success</a>, but the original DS remains Nintendo’s bestselling piece of hardware — plenty of other developers jumped in as well. The early days of the handheld were bursting with creativity. Here’s a sampling:</p>

								<ul><li><em>Trauma Center</em>, an anime drama about doing surgery via swiping and slicing on the touchscreen, as your finger essentially becomes a scalpel</li><li><em>Professor Layton</em>, a detective-themed series of logic puzzle books, where the stylus subs in for a pencil</li><li><em>Electroplankton</em>, a musical toy where you manipulate nature — like bouncing tadpoles off of leaves or spinning strange circular fish — to create beautiful sounds</li><li><em>Scribblenauts</em>, where you can solve puzzles by writing “anything” and the game interprets your handwriting</li><li><em>Etrian Odyssey</em>, a dungeon crawler / cartography sim where you draw your own map, which takes up the entire bottom screen</li><li><em>Elite Beat Agents</em> (and its Japanese counterpart, <em>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</em>), where the touchscreen becomes a <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style musical instrument, forcing you to tap along to the beat</li><li><em>Cooking Mama</em>, where you chop, slice, and plate meals entirely via touch</li></ul>

								<p>The Nintendo DS eased people into the concept of touchscreens because it was also basically a Game Boy. All these touch-friendly games sat alongside titles that barely used touch or ignored it altogether, like Koji Igarashi’s excellent <em>Castlevania</em> run, or role-playing games like <em>Dragon Quest</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. This allowed Nintendo to slowly introduce the idea of interacting with a screen via touch to millions of people, long before the idea became an integral part of modern life. And you can draw a pretty straight line from its launch to the golden days of early iPhone games like <em>Rolando</em>, <em>Tiny Wings</em>, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, and <em>World of Goo</em>, which were similarly full of invention and playfulness. In fact, several hit DS titles, like <em>Cooking Mama </em>and <em>Scribblenauts</em>, eventually made their way to mobile. The transition was almost seamless. Even Nintendo eventually made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13961146/super-mario-run-review-nintendo-mobile-app-iphone-ipad">a mobile <em>Super Mario</em> game you play by tapping</a>.</p>

								<p>Two decades later, a touchscreen is an assumed part of almost any gaming device. It’s become so pervasive that it would be weird if modern hardware like the Switch or PlayStation Portal <em>didn’t</em> have touchscreens. What was once novel to me has since become the norm; when I passed down an old DS to my oldest kid, she wasn’t shocked or amazed that she could pet a virtual pup. It’s what she was used to. But that also made her the ideal person to adopt Charlie, who has been waiting inside of that cartridge for the last 20 years.</p>

November 15, 2024 is the final day to play. After that, the servers go offline and Plants vs. Zombies 3 will be inaccessible in all territories.</p><p>Any earned or purchased coin balances as of November 15, 2024 will be saved as long as you've connected your account through Google Play, Apple ID, or your EA Account. Boosts, game progress (including levels and unlocked units), and narrative will all be reset.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia is a 2024 free-to-play tower defense mobile game developed by EA-owned PopCap Games and published by EA on iPhone and Android in January this year. That followed a soft launch in select regions in 2020, a re-work and subsequent re-launch in April 2022, then another soft-launch in October 2022. A worldwide launch was then planned for later in 2024, but clearly PopCap is still working to get to the root of the game’s issues.</p><p>EA said it’s now “excited to re-tool” the game and “bring you an even better PvZ3 experience soon.”</p><p>“We’ve been grateful for your enthusiasm and feedback during our soft launch,” EA said. “We’ve always had love for our plants, and yes, even our zombies, and it has been a joy bringing life to Dave, his niece, Patrice, Nate, and many more in PvZ3. It’s clear that we’re onto something great and following the recent releases of Choose Your Seeds and the manual activation of Grapes of Wrath, we want to go even further to make the game truly special.</p><p>“That’s why we’re taking the game offline for a major overhaul, and we can’t wait to share what’s taking root!”</p><p>The Plants vs. Zombies franchise has suffered a difficult time in recent years, with various spin-offs failing to replicate the phenomenal popularity of the first two games. Fans often call on EA to release a third game in the third-person shooter spin-off series Garden Warfare, which has been dormant since the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies-battle-for-neighborville">Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville</a> in 2019.</p><p>A canceled single-player Plants vs. Zombies game had been in the works within EA from about 2015 to 2017. Read all about what happened to that in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-a-plants-vs-zombies-game-died-so-a-star-wars-game-could-live-and-then-also-die">a special IGN investigation</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Meanwhile, first-time lobbed through passes are nerfed, as are driven passes.</p><p>There’s a general boost to attacking play, too, with attacking runs for AI players in certain roles given a shot in the arm among other tweaks. This will hopefully make attacking more effective in-game. Those annoying offsides should hopefully calm down, too, with improved AI player recognition of offside situations.</p><p>Elsewhere, there are fixes for various bugs and improved referee decision making when calling for fouls and penalty kicks. FC 25’s refs had become the focus of ridicule for failing to give obvious penalties in-game.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25s-first-live-tuning-update-patches-out-exploit-that-was-ruining-competitive-play">EA Sports issued <u>FC 25</u>'s first live tuning update</a>, which patched out an exploit that was ruining competitive play. Live tuning lets EA Sports roll out some changes without requiring a full title update like today’s. The developer said it can make tuning changes “faster and with more frequency while working on the balance of the game.”</p><p>Wondering what's changed in FC 25? Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ea-sports-fc-25/EA_FC_25_Changes:_Everything_New"><u>list of everything new</u></a> - we've also got the <a

Unfortunately for gamers who want to avoid spoilers, The Veilguard's achievements list has leaked a few weeks early. Anyone who wants to preserve all possible surprises should steer clear of them entirely.</p><p>The Veilguard's achievements have shown up on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1g3lq6t/dav_spoilers_dragon_age_the_veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> thread and in other places online. While we won't be sharing any spoilers in this post, the story-progression achievements appear to be biggest offenders when it comes to ruining any shocks ahead. There are also the prerequisite collectible achievements as well as some that are specific to members of the player's party. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Won’t Leave New Players Behind</p>
      </div>
<p>It's not unlike a film's soundtrack getting released early with spoilers in the track titles, as exemplified by the 1999 release of John Williams' score for Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. The Veilguard is a more personal experience for players, but some of the turning points in the story are going to happen for everyone. It's probably going to be more fun if players aren't looking too far ahead for any twists that await.</p><p>There are certain things that BioWare does want players to know ahead of time, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-times-and-preloading-information-revealed/1100-6527170/" data-ref-id="1100-6527170">launch times for The Veilguard</a>, preloading info, and the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fear-not-dragon-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-0-spiders/1100-6527078/" data-ref-id="1100-6527078">spiders have been excluded</a> from this game. But there will be plenty of other monsters and creatures to fight as players return to Thedas.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

                <p>Three months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">going on strike</a> over concerns over video games' AI voice work, SAG-AFTRA is heading back to the negotiating table with the companies that signed on to the Interactive Media Agreement on October 23. Among the companies engaged in the talks are Disney, Activision, Electronic Arts, and Warner Bros. Games. The guild will also stage a picket line at the Warner Bros. lot on October 16.</p><p>"SAG-AFTRA and the convenience bargaining group with whom the union negotiates its Interactive Media Agreement will resume negotiations on Wednesday, Oct. 23," the announcement read. "The convenience bargaining group includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc."</p><p>No further comment is available from either party at this time.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA announced the strike over the summer, saying that while it made deals with the IMA companies on nearly all issues after more than a year of negotiations, they couldn't come to terms for protections regarding artificial-intelligence replication of voice actors and motion-capture performers' voices, movements, and likenesses.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-due-to-secret-shell-company/1100-6526672/" data-ref-id="1100-6526672">Back in September</a>, SAG-AFTRA honed in on the Formosa Group on claims that the voiceover production company had sought non-union work via a shell company for a video game currently in development. In response, SAG-AFTRA filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board and expanded its strike to League of Legends, one of Formosa's biggest games, which provides huge amounts of voiceover work.</p><p>In a statement shared with GameSpot, a Riot spokesperson said, "League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned in SAG-AFTRA's press release. We want to be clear: Since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise. In addition, we've never asked Formosa to cancel a game that we've registered. All of the allegations in SAG-AFTRA's press release relating to canceling a game or hiring non-union talent relate to a non-Riot game, and have nothing to do with League or any of our games."</p><p>The guild wants to guarantee that video game performers have given consent and compensation for any use of their work in any AI models for video games going forward.</p><p>"What we're saying to the video game companies is, 'Step up, do the same thing that all these other industries and companies have done, and respect human creative performance," SAG-AFTRA general counsel Jeff Bennett <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sag-aftra-general-counsel-jeffrey-bennett-ai-laws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> earlier this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-no-vrr-improvements-pssr-lifting-veil/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will not feature any VRR improvement over the base model at launch, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FenN5sOE1WM&amp;t=5402s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry weekly podcast</a>, John Linnemann reported that, during this year's Tokyo Game Show, he spoke with a Sony representative, asking about any VRR changes to allow LFC, low frame rate compensation. Unfortunately, the representative confirmed that there won't be any changes to the way VRR works over the base model, but they did add that they are aware of the feedback on the matter and may look into making changes in the future. If any change is made, it is expected that they would also be introduced in the base model, although the biggest hurdle to overcome is the 60 Hz output, which prevents LFC from being done well. So, at launch, VRR will continue to be limited to the 48-120 Hz range on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>During this year's Tokyo Game Show, John Linneman was also able to experience the PlayStation 5 Pro in person, highlighting how the improvements the new system brings are better in person than in the footage shared so far. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, in particular, the improvements brought by the system are game-changing, with using PSSR feeling like "lifting a veil of smear" over the horrible image quality of the base model's Performance Mode. With the AI-powered upscaler, the game now sports a clean 4K presentation, with sharp image quality and none of the visual issues that plague Performance Mode on the base model.</p>
<p>The other game running on PlayStation 5 Pro available during the show, Gran Turismo 7, also shows some impressive enhancements. PSSR makes it possible for the game to run at 60 FPS with ray-traced reflections and look great even at reduced base resolution. Unfortunately, the 8K mode cannot be downsampled to 4K, but the option will be looked into to potentially provide even better image quality.</p>

            <p>
The maker of an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> statue has said it will now rework the model's design, after describing its appearance as "insensitive". 
</p>
<p>
In a statement released via social media yesterday, model company Purearts <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1846193318742434183">said</a> it had "immediately returned to the drawing board" to rework its collectible statuette that featured Assassin's Creed Shadows main characters Yasuke and Naoe, following "concerns" raised by some fans. 
</p>
<p>
So, what's the issue? Well, Purearts' original design included a broken torii gate, similar to one found in Nagasaki that broke amidst the city's 1945 atomic bomb blast. Nagasaki's "one-legged torii", at the city's rebuilt Sannō Shrine, has been preserved as a reminder of the city's devastation.

<p>
Customers who pre-ordered the model will be contacted soon with more information on their purchase, Purearts said.
</p>
<p>
Responses to Purearts' statement are mixed, with some suggesting the company should have been more aware of the design's significance before it went into production. Others suggest this is yet another example of Assassin's Creed Shadows being embroiled in controversy by online commentators keen to highlight problems.
</p>
<p>Certainly, Assassin's Creed Shadows has had a bumpy road to release. </p>
<p>A recurring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">backlash to Yasuke's presence and role in Shadows caught the attention of Elon Musk</a> earlier this year, while there were gripes over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">historical inaccuracies in concept art</a> set for a release in a collector's art book. In July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">Ubisoft issued an apology</a> for elements in the game's marketing campaign that had "caused concern" among some Japanese fans. </p><p>Last month, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Shadows was delayed to 2025 following poor sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot raised eyebrows for saying that his company was focused on "creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda".</p>
<p>"Of course we're making creative choices, it's a video game," Assassin's Creed Shadows art director and franchise veteran Thierry Dansereau <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">told Eurogamer back in August</a>, adding that he was confident with how the game would ultimately be received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bruce Nesmith, Skyrim lead designer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> quest designer, has discussed the issue of bugs in Bethesda games, admitting the publisher "could have a higher degree of polish".</p>
<p>Bethesda's games are known for having plenty of bugs - some amusing, some game-breaking - but in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/skyrim-lead-bug-free-starfield-impossible/">VideoGamer</a>, Nesmith said the company can somewhat get away with it due to the complex systems in their games.</p>
<p>"I will be the first person to say that Bethesda Games could have a higher degree of polish," he said. "They have benefited, and when I was there I benefited, from providing such a wide and vast array of gameplay that a certain amount of lack of polish could be forgiven. Having an NPC run in place in front of a wall for a little while became acceptable because of the 17 things you could do with that NPC, whereas most games you’d be able to do two."</p>

<p>Still, Nesmith said it would be "impossible" to release a game without any bugs as games these days are so complex and have "so many working elements that are trying to interact with one another".</p>
<p>"There is no game on the market that is bug free," he surmised.</p>
<p>Nesmith also discussed the possibility of further transparency with players to divulge a list of known bugs ahead of a game's release.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting problem, because when you're in marketing, what you're looking to do is manage expectations," he said. "The players' expectations are that the game is flawless, that it has no bugs. That is their expectation. You don't have to like it, but it's there. And you aren't going to achieve it. So what marketing has to do is say, how can we get as close as possible to that expectation. How can we make it so these guys don't hate us for what's wrong and love us for what's right?"</p><p>Skyrim was notorious for its multiple bugs, though more recently Bethesda has worked to provide more polished experiences. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, for instance, had "the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-has-fewest-bugs-that-any-game-from-bethesda-has-ever-shipped-with-microsoft-says">fewest bugs that any game from Bethesda has ever shipped with</a>" according to Microsoft's Matt Booty ahead of the game's launch last year.</p>
<p>Nesmith left Bethesda in 2021 and, last week, announced he's part of new indie developer NEARstudios creating a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-rpg-hawthorn-looks-like-stardew-valley-and-skyrim-had-an-adorable-baby-together">sim game called Hawthorn</a> that's Skyrim meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> (see trailer above).</p>
<p>Do you think Bethesda games should be more polished? Or would you want to see bug lists ahead of a game's launch?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Do you have a ping of 1000 or something," my opponent asked, during my inaugural bout of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>. Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. <em>That</em>'s the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.</p>
<p>The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Straftat is the work of them what did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, a melancholy Brutalist playground which Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">called</a> "a bit Bernband, a bit Off-Peak, a bit freeform explore-o-platformer". That game had terrific, haunted architecture - ponderous, gap-toothed swathes of concrete that begged to be clambered up and "broken" using such unlikely parkour tools as leaf blowers and trumpets. And so does Straftat, though it casts a wider net and seems more happy-go-lucky in its referencing.

It's a 1v1-only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with no progression systems, just weapons collected from maps that are dealt out at random, from round to round. You get 25 maps in the demo, with 100 in the full release on 24th October. So far, they are all surprisingly non-throwaway. The offerings include: parsley-painted Backroom-style labyrinths (look out for the flamberge spawn, nestled in the crawlspace); vertiginous square walks with sniper rifles at either end, and miniguns perched temptingly in the middle; jumbles of unhelpfully porous gantries and teleporters. Some maps feel like chunks of city, with glowering signage and abandoned cars; others are memes fleshed out into sets, surfing the entropy at the end of history. Everything looks sordid and rundown and unliveable, and I love it all to bits.
</p>
<p>
The weapons, meanwhile, range from glocks and claymores to plasma guns whose projectiles light up the scenery, and instakill electro-cannons that slow you to a waddle. Some can be dual-wielded, others allow aiming down the sights.</p>
<p>The pace of combat feels quite Quakey, with close-quarter duels often consisting of frenzied sliding and jumping, but the more you prance about, the more audible you are. There's no music, and no minimap, so bagging your prey is often a question of listening for footsteps and other, telltale noises - the beep of a mine being deployed, or the death-rattle of a weapon being collected. Is that the sawed-off shotgun you just pinched? You bastard, that's the only gun I can actually hit anything with. Oh lawks, you're behind me, aren't you. Dare I stop moving and sight on a random corner, hoping against hope that you'll blunder into view?
</p><p>
The feeling of pulling from a big hat of FPS levels is delicious, as is the overall aesthetic and presentation. As in Babbdi, characters all look like mouldy potato people, with a selection of dodgy beanies, police caps and pot-bellied suits that feels like quiet mockery of Team Fortress 2. The interface looks like it's been cribbed from a 90s magazine cover demo compilation, then left in the washing machine for about 25 years.</p>
<p>I think this has serious legs as an FPS, providing they can muster enough players: there are no singleplayer options save a firing range, accessible while in matchmaking. Go on, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">try the Steam demo</a>. I'm sure your ping is better than mine. Everybody's ping is better than mine.

            <p>I’ve never learnt to drive, and while I’ve always told myself it’s impractical - unnecessary, expensive, potentially dangerous for someone with undiagnosed but, I suspect, incredibly likely dyspraxia - I’m not sure it’ll ever stop being one of those quiet regrets; the ambient type that don’t really bubble to the surface much unless I’m watching a <a href="https://youtu.be/SmFQR0IltDQ">Noah Gervais road trip</a> video, but just float there and make my mood like, 1.5% worse at all times.
</p><p>So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/keep-driving">Keep Driving</a>'s Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/">demo</a> that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until <a href="https://youtu.be/fFBJu7bliZY">Westkust’s Swirl</a> blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of creative UI loveliness going on, and between its vivid intricacies, the low-stakes scenario, and the music, it all makes even the most mundane encounter or inconvenience take on a sort of mythical, life-altering importance. In other words, it feels like being a teenager. It’s actually really nice to be told sometimes that yes, you are the protagonist of reality and yes, the tractor you’re stuck behind represents a Bildungsroman chapter’s worth of personal growth.</p>
<p>In game terms, what it actually represents is slightly stiff and drawn-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>combat where you use skills and items to defang differently flavoured threats - although there does feel like real potential for it to evolve later. Plus, to be fair, much turn-based combat consists of attacking, defending, and maybe one or two skills for the first few hours, anyway. ‘Threat’ icons will target one of several resources - gas, energy, cash, and your car’s health - and you’ll use abilities and items you’ve stuffed in your glovebox to take them out before they affect you.</p><p>What’s interesting here, and I think deliberate, is the way it frames your ability to overcome these challenges through your own openness and curiosity. Picking up hitchhikers means going out of your way, and their possessions taking up trunk space you could be using for precious supplies. But hitchhikers can also lend their skills to help you during these encounters. I suppose you could see this as an expression of either the silent spirit of the road rewarding you for being a dependable dude, or just calculatedly trying to shove as many people in the back as you can to gain numerical advantage. Either way, even when I’m not especially jazzed with the translation of combat, the way the context around these encounters evokes that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a> sensation of personal, evolving, unpredictable stories is captured well.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a fun “strange pivot after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/post-void">Post Void</a>” sentiment floating around on the reveal, but there’s a throughline here, I think. It’s the same sort of nostalgic love letter to the thumb blistering, caffeinated all-nighter of older games - you’re just inhabiting the person on the other side of the screen now. An interesting thought experiment I occasionally remember to think about while playing something: is what I’m watching intended to depict a reality, or a performance? Am I watching a stage play or folk tale or memory depicting these events, or is this how they’re supposed to have occurred? Basically: how many layers of fiction deep does this thing go?</p>
<p>Keep Driving makes me feel too present to be a memory, and but it's so idealised that it almost has to be. It’s the clouds, I think. That’s a remembered skyline if I ever saw one. It doesn’t all hit, but the parts that do hit like, well, a ten tonne tractor. I don’t think tractors come that big but, please, I’m being wistful. About tractors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>With less than two weeks to go before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> makes its debut, Microsoft has removed its £1/$1 Game Pass trial deal.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, taken by Eurogamer this morning, the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass?ef_id=_k_cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmm3j0z1q0_SEM__k_cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2_k_&amp;msclkid=cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2#join">Game Pass page</a> currently only shows the full prices for a month on the subscription service.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the company has whipped away its rather enticing £1/$1 Game Pass trial prior to a big game launch. It did the same thing last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-cans-recently-nerfed-11-xbox-game-pass-trial">ahead of Starfield's debut</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-will-fix-diablo-4s-broken-spiritborn-evasions-this-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Blizzard will this week release a hotfix to amend the Evade cast animations of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s new Spiritborn class.</p>
<p>The Spiritborn was introduced with Diablo 4's new expansion Vessel of Hatred, but players have found with certain builds their character is able to endlessly evade - even likening it to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a bug as the Spiritborn is able to break animation frames during Evade immediately," wrote <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1845938130735845465">community director Adam Fletcher on X/Twitter</a>. "We will be fixing this so you won't be able to Evade instantly during another one, and instead it will be normalised to the standard Evade cast rate in all situations."</p>

<p>The reason for the change isn't to remove an amusingly overpowered feature, but because it's impacting other players, Fletcher said.</p>
<p>"The reason why we are hitting this bug now (and some may have noticed) is that it is currently impairing other players and their experience in-game," continued Fletcher. "We have mentioned before that if a build ends up impacting the experience of others, we may make changes immediately, and this is one of those instances. We expect this change to come in 2.0.3 later this week."</p>
<p>The patch will also fix crashes and other "hot button items".</p>

<p>Vessel of Hatred launched on 8th October, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-boosts-steam-players-to-record-high-despite-rocky-launch">got off to a rocky start</a> with a short delay due to "a small technical issue" and issues with accessing the expansion on consoles.</p>
<p>Still, the game has reached a new peak concurrent player count on Steam following the expansion's release proving its popularity - though that doesn't account for players on Battle.net or on console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The stream, which will air at 7:00 AM PDT / 3:00 PM BST / 4:00 PM CET, will be presented by the Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. A small teaser for the event was shared today, and you can check it out below.</p>

<p>With Monster Hunter Wilds getting closer to its late February release date, it's no surprise to see promotion ramping up in preparation for what is likely to be one of the most successful game releases of the generation. The team is also continuing to work hard on the game to ensure <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-optimization/">a well-optimized experience on all platforms.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about how some of the new features impact the series' formula by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>While riding on a Seikret allows the hunter to use ranged weapons, having never really used the bow or the bowguns, I opted to go with the two weapons I was more comfortable with: the Long Sword and the Great Sword. Needless to say, I felt instantly at home with both, although my lack of knowledge of Doshaguma forced me to go for more forgiving Foresight Slashes than Iai Spirit Slashes with the Long sword. Though familiar, I appreciated some welcome changes for both weapons. The Long Sword's basic combo string and Foresight Slash, for example, are both enhanced when the Hunter reaches the highest Spirit level, giving users more reasons to hold onto their powered-up Spirit Thrusts and stay at the red Spirit level for longer. For the Greatsword, on the other hand, I did not have much time to discover all the new tweaks that the game will introduce, but the weapon felt as slow yet powerful as it always did, featuring the full array of moves seen in Monster Hunter World.</em></p>

The 14-day Game Pass trial was removed on October 8th, preventing people from signing up for a trial and playing through the <em>Black Ops 6</em> campaign without paying for a full month of Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657627/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-trial-offer-stopped">stopped its $1 trial</a> for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in March last year, before bringing it back and nerfing it down to just 14 days instead of a full month. The Xbox maker then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-pulls-1-xbox-game-pass-trial-just-days-before-starfield-release-date">briefly removed</a> the $1 trial just days before <em>Starfield</em>’s debut in September.</p><p>It’s not surprising to see the $1 Xbox Game Pass trial quietly removed once again, especially as Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">looks to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> to boost its Game Pass subscriber numbers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">I reported earlier this year</a>&nbsp;that Microsoft had been debating whether to put new releases of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>into Game Pass, with concerns from some at the company that the revenue generated from typical&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;sales would be undermined by Game Pass. A $1 trial would certainly undermine sales and subscriptions, especially when Activision traditionally sells more than 20 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;on average, at around $70 each.</p><p>Microsoft is also planning to bring <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, <em>Modern Warfare III</em>, and <em>Warzone</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269925/xbox-cloud-gaming-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-support">to Xbox Cloud Gaming later this month</a>.

But are there plans to shut the game down? Not so, its chief developer has insisted.</p><p>Rumors began circulating this week that support for XDefiant could come to an end after Season 4, which closes out XDefiant's Year 1 roadmap, if its player count failed to improve. Ubisoft has yet to announce player numbers or revenue figures for XDefiant, with Guillemot promising to say more at the end of October.</p><p>Now, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin, who works at Ubisoft’s San Francisco development studio, has responded to those rumors, insisting the company does not plan to shut the game down after Season 4.</p><p>However, in-line with Guillemot’s comments, Rubin — who was an executive producer on Call of Duty before making the switch to Ubisoft — admitted player numbers are down. This, Rubin said, was because Ubisoft has done “very little marketing” as it works to improve the game. Once XDefiant is in “a better place”, the marketing push will begin, Rubin said.</p><p>“To be crystal clear there are NO plans to shut down after Season 4,” Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “I've literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans. But, right now we are super focused on improving the technical experience (which includes netcode) and adding more content for Seasons 3 &amp; 4.</p><p>“We have done very little marketing so yes our numbers are down but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left.”</p><p>XDefiant launched into the brutal live service shooter market at a time when it had already claimed a number of high-profile victims. Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> flopped to the tune of $200 million after Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> suffered a disastrous launch last year. Since then, things have only got more difficult, with Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> going down as one of the biggest PlayStation disasters of all time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ubisoft has endured an awful year with the aforementioned disappointing return from XDefiant and, most recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025"><u>delayed Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a> into 2025 following poor sales of Outlaws, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-france-strike-called-over-return-to-office-order-and-pay-dispute"><u>its staff in France are currently on strike</u></a>.</p><p>In its recent note to investors, Guillemot acknowledged that the company's "second quarter fell short of expectations" and vowed to launch "a review aimed at further improving our execution." He also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda"><u>addressed some of the cultural conversations</u></a> happening around the company lately, which have intensified around Star Wars Outlaws and the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p>Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent are reportedly considering teaming up to take the company private following the collapse of its share price.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ubisoft has ditched Epic Games Store timed exclusivity for its PC games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-returning-to-day-1-steam-releases-starting-with-assassins-creed-shadows"><u>gone back to day-one launches on Steam</u></a>, a move clearly designed to boost flagging sales of its games. Ubisoft has yet to announce a Steam launch for XDefiant, but it feels like a certainty at this point.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu is not retiring from video game music work, despite rumours.</p>
<p>Confusion appears to have arisen following a <a href="https://x.com/Fantasian_EN/status/1846128890856800462">promotional video for the release of Fantasian: Neo Dimension</a>, Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi's RPG for which Uematsu composed the score.</p>
<p>"This is my final project as a composer of video game music," he said. "I hope you'll pick it up and play it! Thanks for your support!"</p>

<p>Fans presumed this meant Uematsu was retiring, but he's since confirmed this is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait, wait! Everybody calm down!," he wrote. "There seems to be some misunderstanding, but I'm not retiring from video game music work!</p>
<p>"I'm going to cut back a bit on my video game music work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make. It would be difficult for me to take on the entire soundtrack of a video game because the time commitment for composing would be too long, but I would like to continue to work on jobs such as one theme song."</p>

<p>This is in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-likely-wont-compose-a-full-game-score-again">previous comments from Uematsu</a> from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>"As far as Final Fantasy is concerned, I'm still involved by writing the main themes for the games," he said back in February. "But I don't think I'll compose music for a whole game again.</p>
<p>"You would have to give it full throttle for two or three years. And I don't think I have the physical and mental strength to do it anymore."</p>
<p>Then, in April, he confirmed he'd be returning to the Final Fantasy series to write a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">new theme song for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy</a>.</p>
<p>Rebirth creative director Tetsuya Nomura asked Uematsu: "I'd like to believe you're a lock for the next title?"</p>
<p>Uematsu replied: "It'd be my honour. Really I'm honoured you're even extending the offer."</p>
<p>Uematsu composed the scores for Final Fantasy 1 - 9, and has contributed to many games since either with co-composers or providing individual songs.</p>
<p>His focus now, though, is his band Uematsu Nobuo conTIKI, as seen in the social post above.</p>
<p>Fantasian: Neo Dimension will be released on 5th December across Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).</p>

			<p>Remedy fans are eager to learn the release date of the Alan Wake 2 Lake House expansion. Well, according to a fresh 'leak' via EB Games New Zealand (<a href="https://x.com/PlotPointsYT/status/1846464652576018642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by X user PlotPointsYT), the second DLC for Remedy's game might be released on October 22.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://www.ebgames.co.nz/product/ps5/309072-alan-wake-ii-deluxe-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists</a> Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition with the following disclaimer:</p>
<p><em>*** Please note due to the global release of Alan Wake 2: Deluxe Edition, the in disc DLC for the Lake House Expansion will not unlock until midnight on 22nd Oct 2024.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> Alan Wake 2 Lake House would launch this October, and there's not much time left in the month anyway. During the September 2024 State of Play, we got our first look at the DLC, which will see players step into the shoes of Federal Bureau of Control agent Kiran Estevez for an adventure parallel to the events seen in the first game. Originally mentioned in Control, Estevez is the Lead Agent of Investigations Unit Beta. Portrayed by actress Janina Gavankar, she says in the trailer:</p>
<p><em>This isn't the Bureau's first time in Bright Falls. The FBC's research department set up a facility, The Lake House. If I had any clue what was waiting for us in there... I would've just kept on driving.</em></p>
<p>The titular Lake House is a secret research facility on the shores of Cauldron Lake, used by the Federal Bureau of Control to study the paranatural effects of the lake and the dark presence within it. Remedy said Alan Wake 2 Lake House would be a chilling survival horror experience, in contrast to the more whimsical stories seen in the first story DLC, which nonetheless got an 8.5/10 score in Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</em></p>

        <p>32 people are out of work</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Riot Games are cutting more jobs at their studios, the company announced today. This is the second time in a year the League of Legends developer has laid off workers. Chairman and co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, made the announcement yesterday, claiming that by cutting these jobs the company was "evolving League" and "investing heavily in solving today’s challenges". A total of 32 people have lost their jobs, mostly workers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-announces-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">a figure the developer gave</a> to our sister site <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This isn’t about reducing headcount to save money," said Merrill in <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/article/1846243708100091985">a post on Xitter</a>, "it’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond." </p>
<p>In January Riot announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-fire-around-530-people-and-shut-down-riot-forge-label-in-push-for-sustainability">slashing 530 jobs</a>, a total of 11% of their global workforce. Today's figure is significantly lower than those previous cuts, but that won't make things easier for those who've lost work. As is normally the case with layoffs, the workers will get severance pay, but Merrill also says they will also get six months health coverage as "support". </p>
<p>"Success isn’t about throwing more people or money at a challenge," Merrill goes on. "We’ve seen small teams at Riot (and elsewhere) build incredible things, while large teams (both at Riot and elsewhere) miss the mark.</p>
<p>"While the League team will ultimately be larger after these changes, what matters more than size is having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach to delivering what players need."</p>
<p>Previous years have seen similar numbers of staff cut from the same studio, such as in January of 2023 when 46 workers were laid off as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-lay-off-46-staff-this-is-part-of-our-normal-course-of-our-business">"part of our normal course of business"</a>. In the wider games industry, job losses continue to affect many. Here are some of the more recent layoffs, along with the unhelpful euphemisms each company has used to linguistically mask the real human cost of someone losing their job. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hi-Rez studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">"reprioritized"</a> an unspoken number of workers.</li>
<li>Lost Boys <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">"reduced"</a> 139 people.</li>
<li>Take Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalized"</a> hundreds of employees. </li>
<li>Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">"aligned"</a> a total of 650 workers. </li>
<li>EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">"sunsetted"</a> around 670 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Layoffs and job losses are common enough in any business, but they do appear to have been especially frequent in the last few years within the gaming industry. It's important to remember that behind each number there is a person who has groceries to buy and electricity bills to pay. To say that you cut off their source of income to "evolve", like some hideous Pokémon, is not comforting or useful, nor an accurate reflection of what has actually happened.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has confirmed that the Until Dawn movie will be released on April 25th, 2025 through its Screen Gems company (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/until-dawn-sony-screen-gems-release-david-f-sandberg-1236116823/">Deadline</a>). <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/18/until-dawn-movie/">The Until Dawn movie</a> was announced earlier this year, with David F Sandberg sitting in the director’s seat. He has previously directed horror movies Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, as well as the more lighthearted superhero movie Shazam!</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn&nbsp;2015 vs. 2024 – Is the remake worth it?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oiW6-ZUKb5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell. How Until Dawn will translate to the cinematic screen remains to be seen, as the game has multiple branches and endings to it depending on player choices. For all we know, there will be multiple versions of the movie with different outcomes, or it will set its own unique ending different to the ones found in the game. Until Dawn’s story follows a group of young adults who are staying at a remote lodge on Blackwood Mountain which, unbeknownst to them, is a hunting ground of sorts and they are they prey. Every playable character in Until Dawn can be killed off at any moment, depending on the player’s own decisions, which is why it is almost impossible to predict which story path the movie will take.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said, <em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-isn%E2%80%99t-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer.1010670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>XDefiant launched to great numbers in its first five weeks, with Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming </a>that over 11 million players checked out the free-to-play first-person shooter during that initial timeframe. However, the situation quickly worsened due to players leaving in droves.</p>
<p>In late August, only around three months after the release, insider Tom Henderson said that Ubisoft had become unhappy with player numbers and the microtransactions (or lack thereof) that come with it. Henderson also said that developer Ubisoft San Francisco was given until the end of Season 4.&nbsp;The news certainly made XDefiant fans uncomfortable, especially since Henderson is usually very well-informed on the publisher's plans. However, a few hours ago, Executive Producer Mark Rubin took to Twitter (X) to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> the game won't be shut down after Season 4; on the contrary, the studio is working on improving the situation.</p>
<p><em>To be crystal clear, there are NO plans to shut down after season 4. I've literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans. But, right now, we are super focused on improving the technical experience (which includes netcode) and adding more content for Seasons 3 &amp; 4. We have done very little marketing, so yes, our numbers are down, but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left.</em></p>
<p>XDefiant is currently in the middle of its second season. The next season is scheduled to add a new faction, three new maps and weapons, a new mode and map type, a 'Bots Mode', private matches, limited-time modes, daily rewards, a Prestige system, a faction mastery system, badges, and a death replay cam. The fourth season will also add a new faction, three new maps and weapons, a new device, a major event takeover, weapons mastery 2.0, weapon skill challenges, and vote to surrender in ranked matches.</p>

<p>You might have caught this one during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-announced-and-featured-at-day-of-the-devs-2024-in-one-place">Day Of The Devs</a> earlier this year. It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a> is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">Crush House</a>. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.</p>
<p>It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/">The demo</a> sees you roll around the island meeting other structures. Some of them have quests for you. Some of them just want to evangelise about bouldering. You can introduce yourself as either ‘Billding’ or ‘Cementha’. You can go fishing for minivans and collect coins, but you can also just make your own joy, especially once you find the double jump and dash upgrades. One secret criteria I use to weight a game’s soul on my scales is whether it’s fun to climb things just for the sake of climbing them; to be <em>at advanced height </em>- in a position of <em>aerial bigitude</em>. It absolutely is here. Some hidden coins don’t hurt, either, but I must insist:</p><p>Please get a sound for when I collect a coin. Collecting a coin without a jingly sound feels like getting fizzy nose then not sneezing. It would have ruined my day, but then I noticed that my house simply would not stop hopping between where their feet should be during conversations. It made it look like they really needed a piss, which spurred me onward.</p>
<p>Also, the camera is a little drunk. Not super drunk, but it’s definitely had a few. It’s a bit stubborn in a wonky sort of way.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/building-relationships-pooping.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Tan Ant Games/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The conversations are fun though. There’s several upgrade chests hidden about named ‘chester’. The one by the beach asks me if I identify more as a bottom floor or a rooftop (disgusting <a href="https://www.ancon.co.uk/projects/sports-leisure/switch-house-tate-modern-extension-london">Switch house </a>erasure). The boathouse is stuck on the lake so wants me to go around finding every fish. Eventually I get invited to a picnic, where I have to build flatpack furniture in another minigame. The flatpack furniture is only about 70% as frustrating as its real-life counterpart to assemble.</p><p>The demo doesn’t extend much beyond there. Stray too far on the island, and you’ll run into ‘relationship barriers’ which prevent further exploring. But there’s still plenty of nooks to explore. A tip: no matter how high you think you can get, and fast you think you can fly across the island, you can probably do it higher and faster. You probably don’t need me to tell you that whether you enjoy this one or not is going to be very vibes-based. But that’s dating, and also exactly what demos are for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-9000d-pc-case/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/corsair%E2%80%99s-9000d-pc-case-is-a-monster-that-can-fit-two-mobos-and-eighteen-fans.1010643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-9000d-pc-case/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Corsair’s monstrous 9000D Super Full-Tower PC Case has just launched, bearing an eye-watering price tag of $499.99 and boasting a gargantuan profile that can accommodate two entire PC setups, making it perfect for the dedicated content creator. It’s a hulking thing that can fit up to 18 fans, configured nicely with the InfiniRail mounting system.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking of investing in this case, you’ll need a lot of room – it’s not unfair to say this is one of the biggest PC cases ever released.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-big-becomes-massive">When Big Becomes Massive</h2>



<p>Corsair’s PC cases are typically phenomenal things. I run a 5000X Mid-Tower case that’s pretty huge, but the 9000D positively dominates my build.</p>



<p>The super-sized 9000D case can accommodate up to <strong>six </strong>SSDs and <strong>five </strong>HDDs, but the main talking point here is that you can fit two PC setups in the box, both running independently of one another. If you’re a streamer, that means your streaming PC and your gaming PC can be housed in the same unit, which is an utter win.</p>



<p>It comes in white or black, but regardless of which colour you pick, you’ll be getting a beast of a case that stands at 698mm (69cm) tall. By comparison, my 5000X case is a measly 520mm tall. The 9000D is 307mm wide, and when built, it weighs a <strong>ridiculous </strong>~30 KG.</p>



<p>On the front of the case, you’ll get four USB 3.2 A ports and two USB-C ports, as well as a headphone and microphone combo jack. Everything about the case has been designed to accommodate accessibility and easy building – Corsair has spared no expense in the creature comforts poured into this unit. </p>



<p>The 9000D PC case is available now from Corsair.</p>



<p>I’d have asked for a review unit, but I’m not sure it’d fit through my front door.</p>

<p>Zack ‘Asmongold’ Hoyt has been banned on Twitch after a controversial rant during a recent stream. While on air, Hoyt slammed the Palestinian people, stating that they’re ‘from an inferior culture’ and making comments suggesting they’d be leading a genocide if they had access to enough weaponry.</p>



<p>After branding Palestinians as ‘terrible people’, Hoyt drew backlash across social media from creators tearing into his views. Shortly after, he was banned on Twitch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-way-too-much-of-an-asshole">‘I Was Way Too Much of an Asshole’</h2>



<p>In the wake of his main account being banned on Twitch, Asmongold took the opportunity to apologise for his statements on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing </p>



<p>My bad </p>



<p>Of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive </p>



<p>You guys deserve more than me saying stupid shit like that, I’ll do better</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The account that has been banned is Zackrawrr, his main channel and the one that played host to his recent rant. His alt channel, Asmongold, is still live, but it’s unclear how long that’ll be the case. Twitch is typically pretty tough on streamers ‘circumventing’ a ban by broadcasting on another channel.</p>



<p>This is far from being the first controversy that Asmongold has found himself embroiled in. The 34-year-old streamer has always been vocal about his opinions, and it often pulls many into a pot-kettle-black type of debate. </p>



<p>One of the things Asmongold is notorious for is his way of living, which typically involves being surrounded by garbage and squalor as he streams to an audience of almost two million followers.</p>



<p>Do you think Asmongold was out of line for what he said? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Danmaku battles faster than you’ve ever seen will unfold in the skies of Gensokyo as you use your mobility to dodge countless bullets flying at you with a variety of spells.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A meteorite suddenly crashes into Gensokyo.</p><p>A crack appears on its metallic, egg-like surface, and small particles of light shine through the cracks, and they scatter all at once, in all directions.</p><p>Eventually, they reach the most powerful residents of Gensokyo.</p><p>One of these lights reaches Reimu Hakurei. It engulfs her, as it transforms into what looks like a suit of armor.</p><p>A name echoes in her head, and she repeats it out loud:</p><p>“Valkyrie Arms…”</p><p>Sensing the beginnings of an incident, she sighs and looks off in the direction which the light came from.</p><p>She floats up into the air, and is gone in the blink of an eye, leaving nothing but a red trail of light behind her.</p><p>“My body feels so light…”</p><p>Flying faster than ever before, Reimu realizes that her armor—her Valkyrie Arms—are to thank for her newfound speed.</p><p>Who gave her this power, and for what purpose? To find the reason behind it all, Reimu hurries on her way… but it doesn’t take long before someone stands in her way.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Standing before Reimu is another girl, similarly clad in a set of Valkyrie Arms. They were both granted the same power, and they both know what must be done…</p><p>And thus, a high-speed danmaku battle begins.</p><p><em>Valkyrie of Phantasm</em> is based on the <em>Touhou</em> series, but has a brand new original story with the creators’ own interpretations of the world and characters.

                <p>A very cool edition of one of the best metroidvanias in recent memory is on sale at Amazon for a limited time. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQRXS8Q2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition</a></strong>, which released in August, is up for grabs for $85 (was $100). Only the PlayStation 5 version is available for this price, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQRX2B8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch edition still costs the full $100</a>. That said, you're getting <em>a lot </em>of extras here, more than what's offered with some collector's editions that costs twice as much.</p><p>Blasphemous 2's well-realized gothic world, haunting enemies, and methodical combat make it a great choice for fans of Castlevania and Dark Souls. The first game in the series was good, but the sequel is much better (and bigger). It's worth noting there's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blasphemous-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C94VTNSP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard physical edition available for $30 for Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blasphemous-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0C9522912?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 for Xbox Series X</a> (the PS5 version is sold out), but Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition looks pretty darn cool.</p><h2>Blasphemous 2 Limited Collector's Edition for PS5</h2><p><strong>$85 (<del>$100</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385229" data-ratio="0.71266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385229"></a><figcaption>Blasphemous 2 Limited Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg"></figure><p>Here's everything you get with Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition:</p><ul><li>Collector's Edition box</li><li>Steelbook</li><li>Collector’s CD cover</li><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Instruction manual</li><li>Two CDs with music by Carlos Viola</li><li>Game Guide with 60+ pages</li><li>Marca Del Martirio metal coin</li><li>Art cards set with 3 new illustrations</li><li>Certificate of Authenticity</li><li>Album of illustrations with more than 60 pages</li></ul><hr><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/" data-ref-id="1900-6418101">Blasphemous 2 review</a> awarded it a 9/10, praising its improvements over the original along with its brooding art style.</p><p>"Blasphemous 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, mixing its unique and harrowing aesthetic with a gameplay amalgam of Metroidvanias and Souls-likes," wrote critic Richard Wakeling.

            <p>
As Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 continues to work through its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-promises-free-new-modes-missions-and-more">previously detailed Year One post-launch roadmap</a>, developer Saber Interactive has offered a glimpse of the sci-fi shooter's new PvE operation - featuring the imposing Hierophant Bio-Titan Tyranid - and Lethal Difficulty mode ahead of their release "very, very soon".
</p>
<p>
As announced back in August, Space Marine 2's first year of post-launch content will be spread across four seasons. Season 1 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-more-helpful-and-effective-bots-private-lobbies-and-more">arrived in September</a>, introducing the likes of private PvE lobbies and a new Battle Barge sparring arena. And with Season 2 poised to launch imminently, Saber has now dug a little deeper into what it'll bring, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aTR-9RYPu0">new overview trailer</a> below.
</p>
<p>
For starters, there's that new PvE operation, taking players and their squads back to Kadaku to face the Hierophant Bio-Titan - a creature described as the "biggest and most terrifying Tyranid yet". And if that's not enough to be getting on with, Season 2 also introduces a Lethal Difficulty setting for operations mode that's designed to "test [players] skills against the most brutal Xenos and heretics". Oh and there's the new Neo-Volkite pistol in the armoury, should you be looking to add a bit of variety to your slaughter.

<p>
Everything above will arrive in a free update for all Space Marine 2 players, and Season Pass owners also get a range of new Dark Angel themed cosmetics at the same time. These includes the Weapon Skin Pack (bringing new looks for the auto bolt, rifle, plasma pistol, and power sword), plus the Champion Pack, which includes a full-body armour skin for the Bulwark class, a unique shield, and other additions - all of which also feature in the Season 2 trailer above.
</p><p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's Season 2 update will arrive for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC "very, very soon". It'll be followed by more new content as Year One continues, including additional PvE operations, new PvP maps, and a survival-based Horde Mode.
