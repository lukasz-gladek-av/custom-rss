			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> studio NEOWIZ announced today that it will publish the debut game of <a href="https://zakazane.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, a Polish indie developer founded a while ago by former CD Projekt RED and 11bit Studios developer Jan Bartkowicz, Piotr Chomiak, Radosław Gwarek, and Marta Sobek. ZAKAZANE had previously raised $1 million in pre-seed investment led by The Games Fund to kickstart the development of their first game, and this partnership is worth another $8 million. ZAKAZANE is currently working on a single player Noir Western RPG set in a&nbsp;remote mining town sheriff must solve a case that threatens to destroy the community.</p>
<p>Jan Bartkowicz, CEO and co-founder of ZAKAZANE, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We found a great understanding of our vision with NEOWIZ, who got excited about our debut title the minute we showed them the demo. In conversations that followed, they never tried to steer us away from our principles but rather to make sure we stick to our guns. It’s clear both sides understand that games can become important to people on a personal level, making them both valuable works of culture and good business.</em></p>
<p>Seung-Cheol Kim, co-CEO at NEOWIZ, stated:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is committed to delivering remarkable, story-driven games that resonate with gamers worldwide, and we're actively searching for talented developers with a passion for well-crafted narratives. When we first met ZAKAZANE, we felt an immediate kinship around their passion for developing projects that profoundly captivate audiences. Their upcoming neo-western RPG will be a key addition to our portfolio and reflects our ambition to build lasting franchises across PC and consoles. Together, we will create a brand that unites quality and storytelling for gamers to cherish for years to come.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time that the developer of Lies of P has signed a deal with a Polish developer. The same happened a year ago with Blank Studio, another team formed from CD Projekt Red alums. They are making a post-apocalyptic character driven game, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/blank-studio-qa-ex-cd-projekt-red-devs-talk-about-their-post-apocalyptic-character-driven-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our Q&amp;A from June 2023.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-neighbor-3-officially-revealed-original-creator-heading-up-team.1032489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tinyBuild has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>, a third mainline entry in the cult classic horror series, and what's more, it boasts the involvement of the franchise's original creator.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>&nbsp;is officially in development, and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov is heading up "a small team of developers" to help bring to life what tinyBuild calls a game full of "systems-based exploration".</p>

<p>You'll explore the town of Raven Brooks as an outsider, enjoying a "cozy yet eerie adventure" as you get to know the locals and their "distinct personalities, circumstances, and desires". It sort of sounds like the original&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=ipNR9EN1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=gXxd6hRw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s development process apparently closely mirrors that of the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher promises that you'll be able to "stick to the shadows in a full simulation" in which you can make decisions, and making said decisions can "potentially unleash catastrophic consequences" upon the inhabitants of Raven Brooks.</p>

<p>In the screenshots tinyBuild has released so far, the art style of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>looks like something of a departure from its predecessors, utilizing moodier and more muddy colors, although it's still got the strange, spindly art style you know (and potentially love).</p>

<p>Kolesnikov says he's hoping that early alphas of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be available to try out soon, and that he's excited to "keep the development of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>in an open format", so presumably, we'll be hearing more about how the project is coming along soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=EhmrSxgg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=pEQQNLnK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s art style looks more realistic and gloomy than that of its predecessors.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>may have that number at the end of its title, it's far from the third&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>

<p>After the first game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-delayed-to-december-8" rel="nofollow">fully released in late 2017</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hello-neighbor-card-game-lets-you-betray-your-friends" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-engineer-releases-first-on-stadia" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a> ensued, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-2-announced" rel="nofollow">full-blooded sequel</a> in the form of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 2&nbsp;</em>(which began life in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-announces-hello-neighbor-spinoff-hello-guest-and-not-e3-event" rel="nofollow">pre-alpha form as&nbsp;<em>Hello Guest</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be released for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet, nor do we know whether it's coming to consoles as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-history-falls-into-place-in-tetris-forever.1032486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For such a simple game, <em>Tetris</em> has a wild history. Developed in the mid-1980s by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union, <em>Tetris</em>’ global expansion involved a complex web of software copyright, clandestine meetings, handshake deals, and someone stretching a tourist visa to the very limits. It’s a story that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">inspired a feature film</a> — but it might be best explored in <em>Tetris Forever</em>, the latest retro game collection from Digital Eclipse.</p><p>The studio has made a name for itself with its interactive documentary format. The idea is that, instead of just presenting a bunch of games and supplementary material and leaving it to players to sort through it, the collections put everything into a timeline you can explore in chronological order. This structure adds context to the games so that you have an understanding of why they’re important or interesting before you play them. The format has been used to tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">the story of Atari’s first five decades</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">how Jordan Mechner developed <em>Karateka</em></a>.</p><p>It’s also ideally suited for the story of <em>Tetris</em>. Like its past collections, Digital Eclipse uses a combination of short documentary-style videos, photos, magazine and advertising scans, and the games themselves, and puts them on a timeline. In this case, you start out watching interviews with Pajitnov about his early life and how he first came up with and developed the concept for <em>Tetris</em>. Then you can play the very first version, made up of ASCII symbols, which was available on a Soviet computer called the Electronika 60.</p><p>From there, the story expands as various figures swoop in to take <em>Tetris</em> to the rest of the world, including Pajitnov’s lifelong friend Henk Rogers, who has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Rogers">his own fascinating backstory</a>. As with all of its releases, Digital Eclipse expertly weaves these storylines together, showing players the importance of each beat in the history of <em>Tetris</em>. It’s augmented by a few important voices — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"><em>Tetris Effect</em> designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a> — who explain the game’s cultural impact.</p><p>What also makes it work is that <em>Tetris Forever</em> is just a great collection of <em>Tetris</em> games. It features 18 games, including some that were never widely released. Now, there are some notable omissions, namely the iconic original Game Boy version, but the collection gets around this in a few ways. First off, it includes an incredible array of variants that show the many ways Pajitnov and other designers tried to build on the original concept. (My personal favorite is <em>Magicaliss</em>, which came bundled with <em>Super Tetris 3</em> and adds some clever puzzles and a very metal fantasy theme.) Then there’s an unofficial Game Boy version that looks, sounds, and plays like the original, even if it doesn’t have the actual Nintendo license.</p><p>There’s also a brand-new version of the game called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>. It starts out like a slick, modern rendition of the game, but every so often will literally warp you back in time briefly, reskinning the game to look like one of the many older variants, and introducing some new challenge that you only have a few moments to complete. Then you’re whisked back to the present. Honestly, I’d buy <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> on its own. But as part of this collection, it’s just an added bonus on top of a great group of classic interpretations.</p><p>For all the ways it has penetrated pop culture, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663214/best-ways-to-play-tetris-2023">finding a good version of <em>Tetris</em> to play on modern hardware isn’t always simple</a>. For that alone, <em>Tetris Forever</em> is worth the price of admission. But like the rest of Digital Eclipse’s work, it takes things a step further and shows how interactivity is the ideal way to dig into video game history.</p><p><small>Tetris Forever <em>launches on November 12th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> introduces players to a brand-new 6v6 game mode known as Ransack. It’s an objective-based mode with a unique goal that sees players collecting and protecting loot, and it can be played on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every 6v6 map in the game</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ones arriving</a> with the first season.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the full details about Ransack in Black Ops 6, here’s how the mode works.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ransack-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ransack work in Black Ops 6? </h2>



<p><strong>Ransack sees two teams of 6 fighting to collect gold bars from crates dotted around the map</strong>. Once players have the gold bars, they must transport them back to their team’s stash, which must be protected at all costs. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Wildcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, the enemy team can find and raid your stash, so you’ll need to make sure it’s well-guarded. The team that reaches the score limit or has the most gold bars when the time limit has been reached will win the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to maintain a balance of attack and defense, as you don’t want to fully focus on one or the other. So, Perks and Scorestreaks that aid your speed and knowledge of the enemy team’s location will be essential, as they’ll allow you to move quickly in either attack or defense and see if the enemies are trying to raid your stash.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ransack-in-black-ops-6">How to play Ransack in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Ransack will be <strong>available to play just like any other game mode in Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</strong>, and it’s not a limited-time mode. You will be able to select it when you filter the game modes you wish to play when finding a match. When Season 1 drops, it’s also likely that the new mode will have its own playlist too so you can easily find and play it.</p>



<p>This is a completely new game mode for Call of Duty, making its debut in Black Ops 6 Season 1. It seems like a mix between Capture the Flag and Grind, where you had to collect tags and bank them before dropping them upon death.</p>



<p>The new Ransack mode arrives alongside Prophunt and limited-time modes in Season 1. Players are also getting some new maps to sink their teeth into, as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update for Warzone</a>. </p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s update version 5.2, dubbed “Tapestry of Spirit and Flame,” will be released on November 20.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 introduces two new Natlan tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan and Masters of the Night-Wind. The elite warriors of this tribe are Chasca and Ororon, and they can be transformed into Saurian companions for players to move and fight mid-air. At the same time, you get to explore the ancient, ruined city of Ochkanatlan while investigating a mysterious incident in the region as a part of the leading seasonal event of the update.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-take-to-the-skies-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">Take to the Skies in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two new species of Saurians will arrive with this update, Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. The Qucusaurs are known to be the best rides in the Flower-Feather Clan. They have an accelerated guiding mode that allows you to cover a lot of distance. You can also use Phlogiston to gain altitude or perform horizontal rolls in mid-flight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Iktomisaurs, on the other hand, are known for reaching vertical heights rather than travelling horizontally. At the same time, they have a unique ability to see, which helps them discover hidden objects. The Iktomisaurs are known as the guides of the Master of the Night Wind. They can also draw energy from Phlogiston-infused objects or craft special items from graffiti patterns.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-characters-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">New Characters in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact introduces Chasca and Ororon in update 5.2. Chasca is known as the great warrior and peacemaker in the Flower-Feather clan and is a 5-star Anemo bow wielder. The characters use a Soulsniper as their firearm and can float in the air while firing different elemental bullets at enemies. Chasca can also use homing bullets for a lethal strike and restore Phlogiston by eliminating enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ororon, on the other hand, is the four-star Electro bow wielder from Masters of the Night Wind. Brought up by Iktomisaurs, this character also can rise in the air and have a keen sense of perception. Ororon can also enter Spiritspeaker state while charging an aimed shot, which allows the character to extract power from the graffiti and runes in Natlan. Lastly, having him on your team increases your gliding speed, too.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-features-and-content">Other Features and Content</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 will continue the story with Archon Quest Chapter V: Interlude, “All Fires Fuel the Flame, with Captain and Kansan assisting the tribe to recover from the damage caused by the Abyss. New threats and a boss called “Tenebrous Papilla” can be found in Natlan, and this monster has been powered by absorbing memories from the corrupted Ley Lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have added the Imaginarium Theater, Serenitea Pot, Artifacts, and other key gadgets with this update.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/10/20241111-genshinimpact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for complete details.</p>

            <p>It was the 20-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> at the weekend, which saw the shooter's modern counterparts celebrating with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-2s-lost-e3-2003-demo-will-finally-be-playable-thanks-to-modder-magic">classic multiplayer maps and long-lost levels</a>. But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel's development back in 2004. Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-2-bungie-development-1235157887/">interviewed two key designers</a> of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Halo and its sequel had a smaller development team than an equivalent blockbuster today might have. This meant some designers would have to do odd jobs outside of their wheelhouse. This is what led Lorraine and Robert McLees, a husband and wife who worked at Bungie during Halo 2's development, to create various things for the game beyond the requirements of their job description. </p>
<p>Although Robert was a weapons designer, for instance, he was also made responsible for coming up with concept art for the Flood. And he particularly remembers creating the infection form of the creature (the little creepy bug-bois that burst and infect their victims with spores).</p>
<p>The first concept "looked like a cross between a house centipede and a blood sausage," he told Rolling Stone. "That was disgusting, but didn’t look very mobile." </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/halo-2-anniversary-20-years-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie / Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unhappy with the first pass, the artist discovered the perfect shape for the alien creature in time for another attempt. And it turned out to be an image that had been "skittering around in the shadowy parts of my brain" since childhood.</p><p>“When my daughter was born, I gathered up all those Golden Key books I remembered from my own childhood so I could read to her before she went to sleep at night. And there it was, in <a href="https://littlegoldenbooks.fandom.com/wiki/The_Saggy_Baggy_Elephant">The Saggy Baggy Elephant</a>, a palm tree launched into the air by dancing elephants — the weird shape that had been haunting my subconscious mind for thirty-odd years. That was the basis for the Flood Infection Form.”</p>
<p>You can see the exact palm tree he mentions in <a href="https://youtu.be/LrxiNYuqcKI?feature=shared&amp;t=16">this YouTube reading of the book</a>. And sure enough, the tree's roots do evoke the unmistakable tendril legs of a Flood critter. The trunk also looks a lot like that ugly conical appendage that crowns the alien larva's head. So I guess we all need to thank children's illustrator Gustaf Tenggren for inspiring a horrifying monster. Neat.</p>
<p>The interview is interesting reading if you're a Halo head. The two designers talk openly about how crunch at the studio affected their life, even as they dealt with a newborn baby. Lorraine, who was responsible for the game's cover art, was also the person who designed the Pillar Of Autumn, the human spaceship from the first Halo. That's cool. If I am ever asked to imagine "human military spaceship", to this day I would instantly summon that vessel to mind.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>A lot of the crunch suffered by Bungie devs is well-documented already. One engineer at the studio said the brutal environment <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungies-13-year-battle-to-kill-crunch-culture">"almost killed Bungie as a company."</a> Another lead engineer, Chris Butcher, once told our sister site Eurogamer that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-recalls-brutal-halo-2-crunch">worked seven day weeks</a> for months on end. Or as he put it:</p>
<blockquote>"The crunch on Halo 2 was, 'Oh my god, we're f***ed. We're all going to die.' Months and months of that emotional, negative tone was really hard to deal with - but at the same time, we did a lot of awesome work."</blockquote>
<p>The Rolling Stone interview basically confirms a lot of that history. </p>
<p>"Bungie, up to then, never had good managers,” said Robert McLees. “They had creatives that were forced into managerial roles while still remaining in their creative roles — basically working two jobs. This kinda worked when there were 12 of us. It worked less well when there were 30 of us. It collapsed when there were 60 of us.”</p>
<p>"At the time, we really didn’t know what was going to happen," added Lorraine. "If we were going to make it or not. It was the make-it-or-break-it period for the young Bungie crew. So much burn-out.”</p>
<p>Crunch continues to be a problem for game developers today. The management of the studio working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">imposed a mandatory seven-day week on its employees</a>, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> workers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-developers-allege-mismanagement-crunch-and-disturbing-creative-decisions-in-new-report">also complained about unsustainable work demands</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, recently confirmed that they have 26 games actively in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameWatch</a> (via <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa Corporation confirmed these games during their latest earnings report. Out of the 26 titles, 20 are being developed for consoles, and the other six are being created for mobile. FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, Acquire, VIC GAME STUDIOS, and more will develop these games. Acquire from the Tenchu series was acquired by Kadokawa in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FromSoftware has several anticipated games on the horizon. Popular franchises like Armored Core and Dark Souls already have multiple instalments, so fans can expect new entries in these series. Additionally, FromSoftware may develop new sequels for titles like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring. Moreover, there is a possibility of receiving remasters or remakes of some of their classic games.</p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware recently increased their base salaries <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 11.8% and offered more to new graduates</a>. Also, I learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-final-boss-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved the Kadokawa corporation</a> from cyberattack losses. What are your thoughts on FromSoftware, the parent company confirming 20 console games?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Arcane Season 2 is the most popular show on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> right now, not just in the UK or US, but across 60+ countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As detailed by data collated by <a href="https://flixpatrol.com/title/arcane/">FlixPatrol</a> - official figures will likely come from Netflix later this week - Arcane leads the pack by a considerable margin and is presently number one on the streaming platform in 65 different countries.</p>

<p>This is great news for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off given both seasons of Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says">making it the most expensive animated series of all time</a>.</p>
<p>The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the rest of the series will fare - right now, just three of the nine episodes are available to view. Episodes four, five and six will debut on 16th November, and the final three on 23rd, bringing the hit show to a close.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p>
<p>Not all game TV and movie adaptations see the same success, of course, although Lara Croft fans were delighted to learn that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Netflix show was coming back for a second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Combining classic and modern game design sensitivity and featuring a world created in collaboration with Chris Avellone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alaloth-champions-of-the-four-kingdoms-preview-tradition-and-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</a> looked, right from its reveal, as a game that could bring a welcome breath of fresh air for top-down role-playing games. The most intriguing feature of the role-playing game by Gamera Interactive is definitely its combat system inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series, but labeling the game as a simple isometric Soul would be a disservice, as it has a lot to offer besides its involving combat system which comes together really well, despite some issues here and there that have a slight impact on the experience as a whole.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241029225501_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is set on Plamen, a continent where four kingdoms have prospered since ancient times. At some point, however, the harmony of the continent was broken by the demon Alaloth, who managed to defeat the many gods worshipped by the people of the four kingdoms that were constantly at odds with one another and establish his dominion on Plamen with a fifth kingdom. Centuries after Alaloth started sowing chaos on Plamen, the people of the four kingdoms have had enough of the demon and elected their champions to recover the Light of Vaizmil to get access to the fifth kingdom and send back Alaloth from whence it came.</p>
<p>The story overview above barely skims the surface of what Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms offers in terms of story, lore, and worldbuilding. It is one of the very few games I've played that makes its world feel as big and alive as it should be, featuring countless locations, including cities, towns, and other points of interest for each kingdom. Inside each of these locations, players can find additional information on the world's history, its happenings, internal strife, and so on. These are not superficial events that are just skimmed over but feature a certain level of complexity that makes them feel like they belong in a fantasy novel.</p>
<p>The presence of different companions, all with their own plight and dedicated storyline, also adds a touch of more personal involvement that the story at large seems to be lacking a bit at times, but even so, for those who love the fantasy genre, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms has a lot for them to delve into. The world is so big and with so many permutations depending on the race and alignment of the champion, that a single playthrough is not enough to experience everything it has to offer.</p>
<p>While the story is clearly inspired by Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, the lore of D&amp;D's Forgotten Realms, and so on, Alaloth: Champion of the Four Kingdoms shows the developer's attitude of innovation within tradition in the gameplay even before the actual campaign begins. Besides a straightforward main campaign with optional local co-op, the game also features an extremely interesting Competitive Campaign that pits the player's champion against those of the other kingdoms, challenging the player to reach the fifth kingdom and destroy Alaloth before any other champion does. This mode, needless to say, is not exactly suited for the first playthrough, given the complexity of the experience and the need to be always on point to stay ahead of the competition. Still, it is a very clever way to up the challenge level after the game's mechanics have been mastered.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241030113639_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, Alaloth: Champion of the Four Kingdom is all about innovating within a traditional framework. After creating your champion in proper RPG fashion, picking the race between human, elf, dwarf, and orc, choosing a god for some additional benefits, and picking a weapon, which in no way restricts what the character can wield during the course of the adventure, you are given your mission to destroy Alaloth, which involves recovering the Light of Vaizmil and complete a few more tasks. How you go on about doing so, it's all up to you.</p>
<p>You can focus on exploring the game's many beautiful locations rendered in a visual style that is extremely close to classic cRPGs like the original Baldur's Gate, help NPCs with their woes and get fully involved in the story of the four kingdoms, or you can play the game as if it were Diablo, focusing only on clearing the Fighting Areas, the game's actual dungeons, gather loot and enhance your character as it levels up by increasing stats, learning perks and a variety of skills ranging from weapon-specific skills for all weapon types and elemental spells. While playing the game as if it were Diablo may not be the best way to go, as you would miss much of the game's story and worldbuilding, it is absolutely viable and enjoyable, mostly thanks to the game's combat system, which takes more than a few pages from the Souls series book.</p>
<p>The combat system of Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is both one of its best features and the one feature that somewhat drags the experience down, depending on how the player tackles the experience. Gamera Interactive undoubtedly did a solid job bringing the mechanics that make Soulslike combat what it is, such as stamina management, positioning, weight, and commitment to performed moves, but, in my opinion, fell into the same trappings most development teams that aren't FromSoftware do. Right from going into the very first Fighting Area, it's clear how this combat system doesn't suit the game's encounter design very much when playing solo. The Soulslike combat system is mostly meant for duels or fights against small groups of enemies, and not the hordes of mobs that are often encountered all over Plamen, which force the player to learn a crowd control skill as quickly as possible or enlist the help of companions. Even so, the game's encounter design often forces a hit-and-run fighting style that becomes stale as the adventure proceeds. When fighting single or only a couple of enemies, however, the combat system truly shines, featuring a rewarding parry system and movesets for each weapon type that feels weighty and impactful, forcing players to balance offense and defense to make it out of a Fighting Area alive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the combat mechanics don't get too much time to shine, even not counting enemy groups being too big for Soulslike combat, due to the game's current balance. A strength dual-wielding build, for example, works so well that there's, in my opinion, no reason to try other builds if not for variation. Some skills are also way more useful than others, mostly due to the long recovery time of the champion and the short recovery time on hit from enemies, which further limits the viability of several builds. The developer, however, is working on balancing mobs' stats and other aspects of the combat system for the soon-to-be-released 1.0 version and beyond, so there's a good chance that all that I talked about above won't be an issue in the game's future versions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031140255_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides combat mechanics, which are still solid enough and will likely get their time to shine with upcoming changes, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms features a lot of interesting mechanics. Character progression, for example, is not tied to experience points like in the vast majority of RPGs, as the champion level increases after completing a Fighting Area. At every level up, it is possible to either increase one of the core stats, invest Legacy points in Proficiencies or Talents, or learn weapon skills and elemental spells, depending on the current level attained. As champions can only level up to level 20 (a clear nod to Dungeons &amp; Dragons) and there are a limited number of Stat, Legacy, and Talent points to allocate, players need to make choices when building their champion. Thankfully, respeccing is pretty easy, so there's no need to create an entirely new character to test out different builds unless one wants to try out another race.</p>
<p>Traversal is also handheld in a very interesting way. While towns, points of interest, and dungeons, which also feature plenty of varied designs and even simple puzzles that prevent them from becoming stale, are explored in a classic top-down view, traveling over the continent requires the players to move the champion on a huge map complete with roads, rivers, lakes, forests, mountains, and so on that can impact travel speed. On roads, for example, the path to one location may be longer, but travel speed is faster, and there's less chance of getting attacked by a random enemy. Traveling through forests could save you some time but also exposes your champion to danger and could make you waste precious time to defeat Alaloth as well since getting defeated not only transfers your champion to the nearest shrine but also reduces the durability of all your item and disperses your gathered artifacts in nearby dungeons, forcing you to complete them to recover them even if they have already been cleared.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241101110839_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking about items, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms features plenty of loot divided into different rarity tiers and a crafting system that allows the Champion to create all sorts of items, from food to potions and gear. In the game's current version, the November 6th version that is still the latest at the time of writing, it is quite inconvenient to take advantage of crafting since you need need to have the materials for making potions, cooking meals, or creating items in your inventory, which can be a problem at the beginning of the adventure when your carry limit is low, but the developer is addressing this issue, alongside others, with a soon-to-be-released patch, so this won't be a problem for players who will jump into the game when the game officially launches later this month.</p>
<p>One of the things that Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms does right is its visuals, which were clearly inspired, as much of the rest of the experience, by classic top-down role-playing games. This choice definitely paid off, allowing the developer to create tons of nicely designed locations that have a distinct identity while looking great. Character models are far from great, honestly, but the top-down camera is zoomed out far enough that they look decent enough as they traverse the many locations the game features on the continent.</p>
<p>These undemanding visuals also ensure Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms can run well on any relatively modern system. At 4K resolution, in a benchmarking session featuring exploration and combat of multiple towns and Fighting Areas, the game ran at an average of 310 FPS, 27 FPS 1% Low, which was caused by the menus being capped at 30 FPS. Given the type of visuals, the game doesn't feature any graphics options outside of resolution and frame rate cap, so there's not a lot to tweak if the game doesn't run well, which I don't expect will happen even on very dated system configurations.</p>
<p>While I may have sounded a little negative when talking about combat and current balancing, I have enjoyed Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms quite a bit for how it blends together rather well mechanics lifted from other RPGs while giving them a personable spin. With just a few tweaks, some of them actually coming in future patches, the experience will become even better, reach a much bigger audience than it had during its Early Access phase, and possibly pay back the development team for all the issues they had to face to get their game out.</p>

<p>Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is one of the most intriguing role-playing games released in recent years. While some design choices, such as the Soulslike combat system that doesn't work too well with Diablolike enemy encounters in the current version of the game, impact the experience, Gamera Interactive blended elements of both traditional and modern RPGs rather well, creating an experience that is more than worthy of any RPG fan's time.</p>

			<p>Being a recent game, there won't be any need for an Elden Ring remaster anytime soon, but this isn't stopping fans from attempting to develop so using the latest technology and game engines.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Konariin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Konarlin</a> shared a video showcasing an impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered fan-made recreation of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, going over the process from concept to actual creation, which looks better than the original game thanks to higher quality textures and more. The end results are extremely impressive, even more so considering this is a fan-made solo project developed in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="I copied Miyazaki to remake Elden Ring… in Unreal Engine 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/atFn2E1anrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite being far from the best-looking open-world action role-playing game released in recent times, Elden Ring is a game that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">more than worthy of anyone's time</a>, thanks to a masterfully crafted experience that is the natural evolution of the Souls series formula introduced by Demon's Souls so many years ago. This formula was further refined in the massive Shadows of the Erdtree expansion released earlier this year. You can learn more about one of the best expansions ever released by the Japanese studio in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-100">RPS 100</a> is our list of the best games to play on PC. It encompasses the full breadth and width of PC gaming stretching back to 1873, but focuses solely on those games that remain great to play today. It's updated yearly by our crack team of writers, and the first half of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">2024 edition is live now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You might note that the format has changed this year. Instead of a long article to scroll through, the list is presented as a sortable, filterable list of game covers, and you can click on each cover to read the RPS team's  evangelism for that game. We hope that it's a pleasant browsing experience.
</p>
<p>Favouring games that are great to play today means that we've paid no mind to importance or influence, but it doesn't mean we've ignored older games, and you'll find plenty of older classics on the list. We've also made a conscious effort to encapsulate the diversity of experiences available on PC. For a start, that means that all games playable on PC are PC games, no matter where they were first released or what extra peripherals (such as VR headsets) they may require. It also means we've made difficult choices and not simply filled the list with excellent-but-similar sequels from beloved series, except in instances where those games feel significantly different from one another.
</p>
<p>You might, as you browse our selection, wonder when you'll reach the bar charts, diagrams and decimal points which explain the cold mathematical logic of our selections. These things are not present in our list. The RPS100 is a work of human beings, for human beings, and as such has been constructed using the twin blades of subjectivity and taste. We think we have pretty great taste and the expertise to explain ourselves, so if you would like to know how wet a game is, how fungible or how zealous, we have explained our opinions under each game when relevant.</p><p>The second half of the list will go live at noon tomorrow. Don't see your favourite game on there when the list is done? There are too many great PC games for us to include them all, but there are comments below the list where you can share your own great taste and bask in the evangelism of your fellow readers. 
</p>
<p>Go, read, and whether you agree with us or not, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">hope you enjoy this year's RPS 100</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s leaks have revealed more details, including a new booster pack arriving next month, an expansion scheduled for January 2025, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> via CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) suggests that a new Pokemon TCG Pocket Booster pack will potentially arrive on December 16, 2024. The pack is named A1a and will seemingly be a “special booster pack,” similar to the Genetic Apex expansion, which is currently available. The new expansion, A2, will be released on January 29, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Pokemon TCG Pocket leaks also reveal new card types, event dates, and other information. A new card rarity may arrive soon; the dates haven’t yet been revealed. A Rare Picks event will also be taking place in the Wonder Pick section of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to Pokemon TCG Pocket leaked event dates, the first one is seemingly scheduled for November 21 and could potentially be a Black Friday event. Another event, Mass Outbreak, will run between November 21 and 28. Then, between November 28 and December 12, a Drop Event will take place. There’s also a store update scheduled for November 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From December 5-19, the Bulbasaur &amp; Magnemite Event Part 1 will be hosted along with Bulbasaur &amp; Magnemite in the store. The event’s second part will occur between December 12 and 19.

        <p>Has "no idea why" Embracer chose to abandon the franchise.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator Warren Spector reckons "if someone made Deus Ex today", the cyberpunk role-playing game "might be perceived as a documentary", given its themes of a dystopian world and evil factions competing to control it.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/deus-ex-director-warren-spector-thinks-that-if-someone-made-deus-ex-today-it-might-be-perceived-as-a-documentary-so-if-he-made-a-new-one-it-would-be-pretty-different/">PC Gamer</a>, Spector reflected on how the world - and game design - has changed in the 25 years since Deus Ex first debuted, adding "I wouldn't make Deus Ex again as it was in 2000 when it could be read as a believable fantasy".</p>

<p>"Y2K was around the corner, AI was becoming a thing, conspiracies were everywhere, terrorism was on the rise, bioengineering was in its infancy, techno-augmentation was in the works," Spector said, talking about how he leaned into real-life issues rather than "trying to convince people to be interested in something" more fantastical.</p>
<p>"All that stuff was floating around in the zeitgeist. Making a game about it was an obvious thing to do."</p>
<p>If he returned to the series now, however, Spector says he'd like to examine "other concerns that would be more relevant, more pressing, more worthy of exploration".</p>
<p>Spector also commented on Embracer's decision to cancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">Eidos Montreal's new Deus Ex game</a> earlier this year, putting almost a hundred people out of work.</p>
<p>The project had been in development at Eidos Montreal for around two years, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">acquisition by Embracer in 2022</a>. The decision to call an end to this project was part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-900-employees-laid-off-in-previous-financial-quarter">Swedish conglomerate's ruthless restructuring</a> and cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>"I really have no idea why Embracer would abandon the Deus Ex franchise, at least for now," Spector said. "From my perspective, the gameplay approach is still relevant, but the world and situation needs some updating."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spector - who also created Epic Mickey - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-3-currently-impossible-warren-spector-says">said he was unavailable to work on a third game in the series</a>, despite the announcement it was being revived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-playstation-5-pro-80-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds open beta comparison video was shared online, highlighting how much the PlayStation 5 Pro can brute force better performance in unpatched titles.</p>
<p>The comparison, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, also confirmed the target resolution and performance on each system. On Xbox Series S, the beta featured a single display mode targeting 1080p resolution, which ran at an average of 40 frames per second; on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, the beta targeted 1080p resolution and ran at an average of 50 FPS in Performance Mode, 2160p resolution running at an average 50 FPS in Resolution Mode. Without a dedicated patch, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta targeted similar resolutions on PlayStation 5 Pro but ran better than on the base model, at an average of 45 FPS in Resolution Mode and 65 FPS in Performance Mode, reaching even 80 FPS in certain scenarios, but sometimes dipping below 60 FPS, which is to be expected for an unoptimized beta. Much like on PC, performance on consoles was very unstable in all display modes, and the reduction in texture, terrain detail, lighting, and draw distance in Performance Mode wasn't enough to achieve the stable 60 FPS a game like this requires.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds | PS5 Pro - PS5 - Xbox Series S/X | Beta Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-_JeRB07dY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Being an open beta likely based on an old build, there's a very good chance Monster Hunter Wilds will run much better at launch. Besides the hopeful performance optimization and improvements, the game's launch version should offer quite a bit for hunters to sink their teeth into, as revealed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-unrevealed-monsters/">datamined information.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-monthly-subscription/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-survey-suggests-apex-legends-might-soon-be-getting-a-monthly-subscription-service.1032411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-monthly-subscription/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new service sent by EA suggests that the publisher is considering a monthly subscription service for Apex Legends.</p>



<p>The new survey, which was sent to several Apex Legends players and then to Insider Gaming, asks participants whether they’d be interested in a “monthly subscription” that would reward subscribers with a monthly in-game currency amount, monthly rewards, and Battle Pass tiers. The subscription service could be similar to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/fortnite-crew-subscription?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Crew</a>, which, at £9.99 a month, gives members exclusive skins, V-bucks, and Battle Pass tiers. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has yet to officially announce any form of Apex Legends monthly subscription service; however, the survey does suggest that they are at least considering it. Past surveys from EA have not so subtly revealed that the questions evolve around future content and ideas that generally are released at one point or another. </p>



<p>To some, the news that EA is exploring more monetization options for Apex Legends is probably unsurprising, as it was announced earlier this year that the company had failed to hit its monetization goals. Last month, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during their investors call that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-season-23-reveals-return-to-original-map-with-classic-weapons-and-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s goal with Apex Legends</a> is to “innovate in the core experience.”</p>



<p>One such “innovation” was bringing back Apex Legends’ original map and experience from the game’s launch, relying on nostalgia to attract players.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, whether EA can maintain its player base with Apex Legends remains to be seen. For those still sticking around, the strategy could be to milk more money from them before the player numbers dwindle further.</p>



<p>What do you think of an Apex Legends subscription service? Would you buy it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        <p>Players have until the end of the month to make their requests.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony is discontinuing the PlayStation Camera adaptor for PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>According to a brief update on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/?">PlayStation website</a>, the device will be withdrawn on 26th November 2024, or "until supplies last".</p>

<p>The adaptor was introduced with the PS5. As a camera is required for PSVR the PS5's HD camera is not compatible, it's the only way to play PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>If you have the tech and haven't yet reached out to secure an adaptor, now's the time to do it - especially as the offer's only good for as long as "supplies last".</p>
<p><a href="http://playstation.com/camera-adaptor">Head to the official website to put in a request</a>. You'll need to provide your PSVR processor unit serial number and - depending upon where you are in the world - your name, email, phone number, and shipping address. The processor unit's serial number should begin with the letter C, M, or P.</p>
<p>Find out why our resident VR expert, Ian Higton, says that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-psvr2-working-on-pc-isnt-as-easy-as-it-should-be">getting the PS VR2 working on PC isn't nearly as easy as it should be</a>.</p>
<p>Ian also took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metro-awakening-vr-review">Metro Awakening VR for Eurogamer</a>, awarding it three out of five stars, saying: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a> VR delivers some terrifying moments in its deep, thought-provoking story, but after a strong start, repetitive levels and pacing issues kill most of its momentum".

            <p>There's a whole generation of video game fans who don't know very much about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, and that's one of the reasons we are getting a remake in the form of Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>This revelation comes from series producer Noriaki Okamura, who told Play magazine the team realised "a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren't familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>As such, Konami's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> remake is being created with future generations in mind.</p>

<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura explained. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>As for why we are getting a remake of the third Metal Gear game, Okamura noted it takes place first chronologically. "That's where the original story started," he said, so it just made sense.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">back in May last year</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, despite a PlayStation blog previously suggesting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">remake would make its debut some time this year</a>.

<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Unlike other big fantasy roleplaying games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, Avowed won't feature any romance options when it lands in around three months. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-defends-the-rpgs-lack-of-romance-in-the-face-of-baldurs-gate-3s-intense-relationships-i-think-players-will-always-respond-well-to-a-really-good-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Gamesradar</a> during the recent EGX convention, Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel explained:</p>
<p><em>It works very well in some games. It's a ton of work. You want to make sure you do it right. And part of that is also you want to make sure that a player who opts not to romance but still wants to have a very deep relationship with those companions gets to have just as thorough and meaningful an experience on a friendship or ally path as if they went on a romance path. And so we felt that we could best tell our companions' stories and our players' relationships with them without the romance option. With the four companions, we wanted them to all have key roles in the story, different party roles, different personalities, and ways that they complement each other and let them tell the story of the Living Lands to the player.</em></p>
<p>Patel then added that the lack of romance is particularly meaningful because one of the four companions featured in Avowed is already engaged with someone else.</p>
<p><em>It isn't a story that I think you often get to see in a lot of games with a party member who's traveling with you, and so one thing players will really get to explore with here is kind of how she navigates having her heart in one place while knowing that she really needs to be here.</em></p>
<p>Having one companion unavailable for romance is nothing new, though. Many games have successfully implemented romance with similar limitations. As a whole, it seems like Obsidian isn't too keen on romance if we take a look at their past games. What's considered their best game, Fallout: New Vegas, had no such thing, despite allowing you to sleep with some NPCs for casual affairs, and the same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds</a>. One of the few exceptions was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a>, but that was an isometric cRPG, which meant a lot less work had to go into actual romance scenes than for a third-person game.</p>
<p>Avowed <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches</a> on February 18, 2025 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Stay tuned for a lot more in the lead-up to the release date.</p>

<p>The GTA community is eager to hear more about the next instalment in the series, and once again have theorised Rockstar left a clue about the upcoming game in its GTA Online promotional material.</p>
<p>The material in question shows a character leaning on a car, while looking up at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory. But, it isn't the character or the factory that has caught the attention of eager fans. It is the moon that shines down on the scene from the upper corner.</p>

<p>The moon in this image is a waning gibbous, and the moon here in the real world will be at the same phase on 22nd November. That's a week on Friday, and fans believe this is a sign from the developer, telling them the date of the next GTA 6 trailer.</p><p>While this all may seem a bit of a longshot, this isn't the first time GTA players have turned to the moon for GTA 6 clues.

            <p>
Smash hit smartphone app Pokémon TCG Pocket will add its first big expansion of fresh cards in late January, according to a new leak. 
</p>
<p>
A datamine of the game's event schedule posted by <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518">Centro Leaks</a> suggests the game's currently-untitled first expansion will arrive on 29th January - with the caveats that final dates are still subject to change. 
</p>
<p>
That current plan would mean a roughly three-month window between the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket and the arrival of a flurry of new cards - which feels about right?

<p>
That said, there's also suggestion of a special booster pack due for launch in December - which points to a smattering of extra cards arriving slightly sooner to tide fans over. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming additions to Pokémon TCG Pocket spotted in the datamine include a new card rarity, and rare picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic.

Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be off to a great start, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-passes-30m-downloads-in-a-week">$12m earned over the game's first four days</a> and more than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">30m downloads after a week</a>.

            <p>Let’s try and get you up to speed on the fascinating oddity that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ecosystem">Ecosystem</a>, on the off chance that Nate's coverage of it hasn't stuck with you like an unwelcome brain parasite you’re nonetheless unwilling to get removed for fear of the lingering emptiness it might cause (he once described an eel as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-virtual-eel-nearly-became-intelligent-enough-to-grind-my-pc-to-a-halt">“a quaver with erectile dysfunction”</a>). Broadly speaking, this game is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s evolutionary-biology-degree-having cousin. It’s been in early access for about three years now, but with the latest "Crustacean" update, it’s just hit 1.0. Once again, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/">carcinization has come for all things</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here’s how the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133120/Ecosystem/">Steam page</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The nervous system of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs passes through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part. Creatures swim just like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nate’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ecosystem-has-burst-my-mind-and-you-could-be-playing-it-right-now">attempts to play Poseidon</a> are worth reading up on if you’re curious, but in short, Ecosystem lets you tweak certain environmental factors or traits to guide the evolutionary trajectories of your aquatic abominations, or just start with a clutch of random lifeforms and see how they get on. Most will be too stupid to live - or even move - but a few will have traits that let them survive, and these traits will be passed down to their offspring. 

</p><p>Since Nate last played, the game has added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/3675554043635333909">fishy combat</a>, in which animals now directly attack one another and evolve spikes and hard skin to defend themselves from predators. There's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/4209252160976023355">more complex behaviour</a> that will see them building nests and swimming in groups. Everything down to the way they traverse the ocean is simulated. It looks fascinating. Also: Data!</p>
<blockquote><p>For players who want to monitor their ecosystems closely, there is a lot of data at your fingertips. We’ve got you covered for all the statistics and analysis of your world that you could possibly want - from ecosystem overviews showing population charts for both animals and plants to phylogenetic trees for individual species, allowing you to track your species evolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>To celebrate 1.0, there’s also a chunky 30% discount running until the 22nd of November. I’m very tempted, if only to see how close I get to turning one of these hapless, flailing lifeforms into Godzilla.</p>

Nintendo will hold a special Direct broadcast later today - but, once again, it's not to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>

Instead, the Super Nintendo World Direct will focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">upcoming addition of Donkey Kong Country</a> to Universal Studios Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the broadcast, which is scheduled for 10pm UK time tonight (that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern), Nintendo said the stream would last for roughly 10 minutes and that no information on upcoming games will be featured.

			<p>The Metal Slug series would have been low on my list as a candidate for a tactics game. Better known for bombastic 2D run ‘n’ gun shooting, it’s the antithesis of a slower, more thoughtful tactics games. Like its iconic pixellated tanks though, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is ready to blow those expectations to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZlvf_m8Zc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>General Donald Morden is the returning big bad, and having escaped justice – as bad men always seem to do – he’s declared martial law in Sirocco City. This is A. Bad. Thing. and you are part of the ragtag team sent in to stop him.</p>


<p>There’s plenty of early familiarity to the way that Metal Slug Tactics works. An isometric view is broken down into a grid, and you move your units about the map as far as their movement allows, before then using whatever offensive technique is available to you.</p>
<p>Leikir Studios haven’t sat on their pixelated laurels though, and while publisher Dotemu is behind stellar upgrades and reimaginings like Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap and Streets of Rage 4, it’s nice to see that they’ve taken a fresh approach to the tactics genre. The further your unit moves, the more Dodge resources they generate, and that stat reduces how much damage your character takes. Combined with using cover to further protect you, you can effectively charge through the enemies’ defences and unleash devastation. This makes it feel like Metal Slug.</p>


<p>Your special abilities further enhance that feel. These are powered by Adrenaline, another resource you gain with longer movement, via jumps, or through certain passive abilities and actions. You can save these abilities up to cause massive damage, calling in airstrikes or amping up your unit’s weaponry, and they’re critical to success against some of the larger tanks and enemy units you come up against.</p>
<p>The last key to the tactical puzzle is syncing up your attacks, positioning your team so that they’ll all join in with their own additional attacks, whittling down the enemies’ health bars as they do. In other series, this might feel optional, but here it’s downright essential, particularly at the start of each run before you’ve had a chance to buff your team.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Metal Slug Tactics all starts to make sense. Leikir have translated the run ‘n’ gun ethos of the original into a tactics game with startling clarity, without overcomplicating things, and it’s somehow balanced the outlook of the series and its new form. As a long-time fan of Metal Slug, who also happens to love games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, it’s a perfect mix.</p>

<p>It helps that it looks so pretty. The isometric viewpoint leans into the original’s pixel-art design, and everything feels authentic to the series. That’s before the hi-res artwork appears, lifting the UI, character conversations and special abilities so that it feels unequivocally modern.</p>
<p>That modernity then stretches into the game’s progression system, lifting roguelike elements so that you start a new run each time, gaining experience to level up your characters and their abilities as you advance. You choose your route across each stage, the map offering different rewards in each area. Again, it makes perfect sense with Metal Slug’s arcade roots, and it retains the addictive one-more-go design that would have ensured you kept ploughing money into the slot.</p>
<p>It definitely doesn’t go easy on you, and there’s that early punishment you’d expect from a Roguelike, but once you’ve got a handle on what it expects of you, and you’ve started to level up your team, things start to become easier for you.</p>

<p>Fans of 90s arcade games will love the sound design as well, which is thoroughly old-school. Between the energetic electronic soundtrack and the digitised voice work, Metal Slug Tactics sounds like you could be in the 90s, and it’s utterly brilliant, at least if you’re old enough to be played by the nostalgia card.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I love what Dotemu and Leikir Studios have achieved with Metal Slug Tactics. The unlikeliest pivot for a franchise aside, it mixes interesting tactical action, Roguelike progression and brilliant visuals into an indie title that nails the balance between nostalgia and modernity.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/india%E2%80%99s-gaming-market-to-be-bigger-than-bollywood-by-2029.1032333/</guid>

<p>It has been estimated that there is rampant growth for the Indian gaming sector on the horizon. Per a recent report published by Lumikai, it was predicted that the region would see a CAGR of 20% leading to 2029, causing the market’s valuation to grow from around $3.8 billion today to $9.2 billion by 2029.</p>



<p>It was noted that gaming is India’s ‘fastest-growing new media segment’ behind video and OTT media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-future">To The Future</h2>



<p>India boasts an audience of 591 million gamers, with a split of around 44% – 66% in favour of male players. Mobile games are king in the country, and Lumikai estimated that India is the second-largest consumer of mobile games in the world. That’s why games like BGMI, Call of Duty Mobile, and Free Fire do so well in the country.</p>



<p><em>As a side note, if you’re a Free Fire fan and are looking to score some free Diamonds, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-diamonds-in-free-fire-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our guide</a>.</em></p>



<p>In recent years, the numbers have shown that Indian gamers (particularly those in the 18 to 30-year-old age group) have boosted their average weekly gaming time by around 30%. We’re also seeing a rapid expansion of the region’s esports industry, with more competitive gamers than ever appearing across the country.</p>



<p>Lumikai, a data aggregation firm, revealed that when it started collecting data in 2020, there were just 25 notable gaming companies in India. In the most recent pass, more than 2,300 companies (‘leads’) were recorded in the country. One senior associate at Lumikai, Aditya Deshpande, suggested that the growth of gaming will <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/indias-game-market-could-grow-from-3-8b-to-9-2b-by-2029-lumikai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surpass the value of Bollywood</a> in the coming years.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <a href="https://www.lumikai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumikai</a> is an Indian venture capital firm <strong>focused </strong>on the Indian market, but external firms have predicted similar growth.</p>

<p>The 2025 iteration of the Grammy Awards is fast approaching, and once again, the nominees for ‘Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media’ have been revealed. Put simply, it’s the award that crowns the best soundtrack from a video game that has emerged in recent months, but the line-up is slim and PlayStation has dominated this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-nominated-for-a-grammy">Games Nominated for a Grammy</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and PlayStation are dominating the nominee roster this year for the ‘Best Video Game Soundtrack’ category at the Grammy Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</li>
</ul>



<p>Bear McCreary (God of War) is a regular nominee at this point—he’s had his name thrown into the pot during every Grammy Awards ceremony where this category has existed. The category was only opened up in 2023, and previously, it was won by Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla in 2023 and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in 2024.</p>



<p>Could Ubisoft go for the triple header and win again this time with Star Wars Outlaws or Avatar?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, fans have had issues with this category at the Grammy Awards since it debuted in 2023. Back then, the likes of <strong>Call of Duty </strong>made it into the running, which rankled with gamers worldwide. It seemed then – and it still seems now – that indie titles with better soundtracks are being snubbed for the big, mainstream names.</p>



<p>It reached a point where one of the voting board members <a href="https://x.com/masonlieberman/status/1592916480160473088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to explain how things work behind the scenes. He explained that low participation led to few nominations and that the vast majority of the voters on the board were film composers who rarely – if ever – interacted with the video game world.</p>



<p>This year, the only game that isn’t one of the ‘bigger hitters’ is a remake of a game that was released in 1980, which feels almost shoehorned in to hit a diversity requirement.</p>



<p>Do you want to see more diversity in this category at the Grammy Awards? Let us know in the comments.</p>

That said, you can add to your experience by combining the standalone expansions with the core sets. Power of the Dark Side is the "core set" for Star Wars Villainous, so you can combine it with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Villainous-Expandalone-Family-Strategy/dp/B0D3FDVTPG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revenge at Last</a> and/or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Villainous-Villainy-Expandalone/dp/B0CFMFPZF9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scum and Villainy</a>.</p><p>Power of the Dark Side comes with everything you need to start playing Villainous, allowing you to jump into the shoes of Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, General Grievous, Asajj Ventress, and Moff Gideon. Each villain is represented as a sculpted figurine. Star Wars Villainous also comes with over 200 illustrated cards as well as various tokens and trackers used to keep track of the action.</p><p>Ravensburger's Villainous series is recommended for players ages 10 and up, and games last roughly an hour. Most entries in the series, including the Star Wars-themed edition, support two to four players out of the box. If you combine sets, the player count can reach six. It is worth noting that Bigger and Badder, the version of Villainous focused on Pixar animated movies, is only for two to three players.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>   </ul> </div>
