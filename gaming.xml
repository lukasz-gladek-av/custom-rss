		<p>Ubisoft, which received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">€1.16bn investment in 2025 from Tencent,</a>&nbsp; have closed its studio in Halifax, Canada, with the shutdown coming just a few weeks after the employees voted to unionise.&nbsp; The studio had been running for over ten years.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson. </span><span data-testid="content-text">“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Employees at Ubisoft Halifax formed a union under CWA Canada, which also includes employees from Bethesda Montreal, on December 18th, 2025. 74% of the staff voted in favour of the move.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">“In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty, studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft,” they stated at the time.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">CWA Canada has not made any official comment about the timing of the two events, but is “demanding information”. “Today’s news is devastating,” commented CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth. “We will pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way.”</p>

<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Rockstar Games was recently accused of ‘union busting’ after firing 30 employees who belonged to a union, stating that the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum. This has been denied by the staff.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Following the dismissals last week, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>

			<p><strong>StarCraft</strong> is reportedly making a comeback at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>, with a recent report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a> pointing to <strong>Blizzard</strong> unveiling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-allegedly-incubating-a-starcraft-shooter/">long-rumoured third-person StarCraft shooter</a> at this year's convention.</p>



<p>Corden's report covering the upcoming year for Xbox included several claims as to what we'll see from Microsoft and Xbox in 2026, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters</a> and a claim (which was corroborated by a separate outlet) <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">that MachineGames has Wolfenstein 3 in development</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to Blizzard, Corden claimed that BlizzCon 2026 is where we'll see reveals for World of Warcraft's next expansion and updates on both Overwatch and Hearthstone and potentially new mobile titles. But none of that will be the 'big' announcement from the show, with Corden instead claiming that title will go to the reveal of the third-person StarCraft shooter coming from Blizzard.</p>



<p>"<em>The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumours true via my own sources a while back</em>," Corden writes.</p>



<p>A third-person shooter set in the StarCraft world is the exact kind of project that has the potential to bring the StarCraft franchise back to life, since it has seemingly remained dormant for over a decade. The last major release in the franchise was StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, which arrived back in July 2010 and was followed by three DLC expansions, the last of which was released in 2016. The last time we saw a new StarCraft release at all was 2017 with the release of StarCraft Remastered.</p>



<p>Since then, Blizzard has seemingly dedicated its focus to Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and World of Warcraft over returning to the popular sci-fi RTS series. A new third-person shooter would be the culmination of years spent waiting for fans who never got over the cancellation of StarCraft: Ghost, and the thing to bring back the franchise ahead of the next RTS title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/">which we last heard would be coming from Nexon instead of Blizzard</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, when BlizzCon 2026 rolls around, we'll have a new shooter to look forward to.</p>

            <guid>1399912</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for my favorite Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> finally gave it to me. I dove headlong into the RPG upon release, spending every spare moment I could in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246#:~:text=the%20citizens%20of-,Lumiose%20City,-.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20Pidgey"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, but now that I’m nearly done with everything the game has to offer, I’m starting to feel my running and jumping through the streets of its Paris-inspired setting shift to a light jog.&nbsp; As I catch the last few monsters in the expansion’s dex and cross off the remaining sidequests, my steps slow as I wait for my Mega Raichu, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>flying behind me like he’s Superman, to catch up</span></a><span>, savoring a few more seconds with his golden, two-tailed, superpowered form.</span></p> <p><span>A friend of mine who also happens to be one of the biggest </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans I’ve ever known was visiting me in New York City a few months back, and I was surprised to learn that she hadn’t finished 2024’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i></a><span>, despite being positive on it. She explained that, especially after everything that’s happened to BioWare in the past year, she felt like seeing the credits roll on this latest entry would mean the end of a “moment” of her life, as </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>future seems murky</span></a><span> at best. I kind of understood, but part of me is also of the mind that seeing something through to the end is only half the experience. Sitting with it and examining its complexities is just as important. But eventually, you exhaust yourself of all that reflection and move on to something else. My reluctance to put </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>in the rearview mirror is helping me understand where she was coming from, and why people often opt not to finish games they deeply admire and enjoy. It is comforting knowing that you haven’t hit that endpoint yet, even if it means you’re depriving yourself of something you love.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve been writing about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>for months here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and I can feel that part of me that loves to critically analyze and engage with these games preparing to move on as next month’s inevitable Generation X announcement on Pokémon Day approaches. This game has been a really compelling experiment , letting Game Freak play around with real-time battles and a single-city setting, and I truly wish the studio would release another major DLC expansion or </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> to keep it going. But I also recognize it’s done what it needed to do. I don’t need more for more’s sake. In fact, with most video game franchises, I prefer things to go away forever after they’ve run their course.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657801"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657801">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a weird outlier for me on that front as I’m always down to explore a new place in this universe, and since Game Freak took a year without a new game or DLC pack in 2024, the gap between </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s expansions and </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> felt painfully long. So even if </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>hadn’t given Raichu two much needed Mega Evolutions, I would have been squeezing every drop of Pokéjuice out of this game. But on top of that, my superhero rat just got here, and I would be surprised if Mega Evolution showed up in the next pair of RPGs we’re probably getting our first glimpse of next month.</span></p>

 <p><span>I put over 120 hours into </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> and its DLC. I had Mega Raichu by my side for about 60 of those hours, and that still doesn’t feel like enough. Raichu and I will inevitably meet up again in the next game, but it sure hurts knowing I waited all this time to have him Mega Evolve just for it to only last a couple of months before we move on. Lumiose City may not be pretty to look at, but I still love hanging out with its weird citizens who say odd shit and love this metropolis with all their heart. I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>So now, to make it last just a little bit longer, all I can do is bide my time. I’m booting up my Switch 2 less often. I’m doing menial tasks and wandering in places I’ve already seen dozens of times. As long as there’s an incomplete quest or a Pokémon I haven’t added to my Pokédex, I have a reason to come back. The knowledge that it’s not over is somehow more comforting than having one less game on my backlog list.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>

Fans have spent the time since the December 16 launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-goes-live-alongside-big-170-patch-notes"><u>update 1.7.0</u></a> (a.k.a. Cold Snap) theorizing about what the new year may hold while sharing any new concerns with Embark. Although The Goalie Raider Deck helped tide players over late last month, the lack of a firm 2026 roadmap has left some fans curious about what’s to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One player tapped into some of their more pressing issues and shared them with Embark yesterday. They specifically take issue with what they believe is a “lack of urgency” at the studio, calling for communication and tweaks for Stella Montis, cheaters, the skill tree, Trigger Nades, and more. Birdie replied, and while not every point was addressed, it seems Embark has plans to tackle balance changes sooner rather than later – and a Trigger Nade nerf may be on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade,” the community manager explained. “Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shape these nerfs will take remains unclear for now, leaving some players concerned that they’ll do more harm than good before actually evening the playing field. It’s also unclear if the next Arc Raiders update will feature some of these teased balance adjustments, but it’s least being looked into as Embark gets back into the swing of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Arc Raiders news is a far cry from the 2026 roadmap fans have been hoping to see. While we wait for something more concrete from the team, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>why some fans are expecting to eventually see an Arc Raiders movie and TV show</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the Wolfenstein franchise may be on the way, according to multiple reports today. Specifically, a Wolfenstein 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The possibility was first mentioned by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central today</a> as part of a 2026 Xbox predictions piece, and was corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a>. No hard details were provided, just that the game is in development with Machine Games and, per Windows Central, may be timed to coincide with the already-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV series with Amazon</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This would be Machine Games' first return to Wolfenstein since 2019's Wolfenstein: Young Blood, which saw series protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz's twin daughters searching for him in France and, of course, fighting the Nazis. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, was all the way back in 2017, so a third Wolfenstein game would be a long-awaited return indeed. Of course, MachineGames has been a bit busy lately, helping out on Doom: Legacy of Rust and developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Windows Central also suggests the studio may be working on a "Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein reports also aren't a huge shock, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">Machine Games studio head Jerk Gustafsson said</a> just this past September that the series was always meant to be a trilogy, and that "we're not done with Wolfenstein yet." A third game would presumably find a way to wrap up B.J. Blazkowicz's story, and would almost certainly find a way to wrap up the ongoing battle against the Nazis. It's unclear if it would take place before or after Young Blood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Young Blood, we weren't the biggest fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/wolfenstein-youngblood-review">giving it a 6.5/10 </a>and calling it "an aggressively okay co-op shooter that doesn’t come close to recapturing the joy of its predecessor’s action or its surprisingly interesting characters and story." We did, however, love The New Colossus, saying it's "a fantastic single-player shooter" with "brilliantly written characters and performances" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/28/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review">our 9.1/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

This update is giving the baby animals their own specific designs and completely new sound recordings pulled from real animals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLDBHodmGs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FaLDBHodmGs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Larsen went on to explain a more subtle touch that gives the baby mobs' faces a more youthful appearance.</p><p>"Typically mobs in Minecraft have two-pixel eyes," said Larsen. "But now baby mobs have just one which creates a new vibe for them, which is just adorable."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/first-features-minecraft-cutest-drop-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devs also revealed</a> that players will be able to name their baby mobs with craftable labels using paper and any metal nugget. Players can preview the changes in Java snapshot and the Bedrock beta preview now.</p><p>In December, Mojang Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-lets-players-ride-into-combat/1100-6536825/" data-ref-id="1100-6536825">the Mounts of Mayhem update</a>, which lets players ride animals into combat situations among other changes.

                <p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report on the site TipRanks</a> said that Microsoft is "considering massive layoffs" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whatlayoff.com/post/3mbtiwjmgtz2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2008806488190709970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2008865530749571146" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purported that the news was "false"</a> on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxshaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to his LinkedIn</a>--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.</p>  — Frank X.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>1399855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation</strong> was undoubtedly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest gaming-related announcement</a> made by the world's largest company (by market cap) at <strong>CES 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of trailing behind NVIDIA in the upscaling department, AMD finally delivered a worthy competitor with <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4</strong> in 2025, with the year ending on a high note <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the <strong>Redstone</strong> update</a> that injected FSR with a machine learning algorithm, as well as delivering an improved <strong>Frame Generation</strong> algorithm and the brand new <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong> (an analog to NVIDIA's <strong>DLSS Ray Reconstruction</strong>) and <strong>Radiance Caching</strong> (seemingly similar to NVIDIA's <strong>Neural Radiance Cache</strong>, although it is not yet ready for release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fsr-radiance-caching-requires-further-development-optimization-is-not-currently-planned-release-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>).</p>



<p>Less than a month later, NVIDIA answered in kind with the release of its <strong>second-generation transformer model</strong> for the DLSS Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 has been trained on a much larger and higher-fidelity dataset, and as such, utilizes five times the compute power; that's why the initial tests have shown older <strong>GeForce RTX</strong> graphics cards struggling with it.</p>



<p>Luckily, those PC users can still use the older models, either the CNN one or the first-gen transformer model, which run games noticeably faster. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 is not really about increased speed - that's what Dynamic Multi Frame Generation helps with, but more on that later - <strong>it is instead about delivering the highest possible quality</strong>. This model demonstrates its power through a deeper understanding of game scenes and a more intelligent use of game engine pixel sampling and motion data, delivering output images with improved lighting, sharper visuals (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as demonstrated in an early <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> comparison</a>), and enhanced motion clarity.</p>



<p>We had our very own CEO, Abdullah Saad, attending CES 2026 and checking out the various NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 demos available at the booth. He was particularly impressed by the lighting improvement delivered by the new transformer model in the game <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and the NVIDIA rep explained:</p>



<p><em>There's a very technical reason for that. The engine does the math in what's called physical space, which is like how the physics actually operates. It's not thinking in terms of gamma and stuff like that. It's thinking basically in real life math, like the light goes here, this light is at this amount of nits, and then at some point down the pipeline, it gets tone-mapped and ported to your display. The older DLSS, preset K, is accumulating the data at the end of that, so after tone mapping. It's losing some of that data, the highlights for example, and it's accumulating on that. TAA (Temporal AntiAliasing) can also have that problem, but here we move the new one closer to the engine so it's seeing more of what the engine is trying to show as far as the lighting goes, so it's losing less of that highlight detail.</em></p>



<p>In more technical terms, the previous upscaling algorithm worked in logarithmic space to mitigate flickering, but resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. Now, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the same space used by games, and is thus capable of allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. This could be an indirect been to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR gaming</a></strong> under NVIDIA DLSS 4.5.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The other half of the NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 announcement, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, won't be available publicly before Spring 2026, but it could be tested at the NVIDIA CES 2026 booth. Beyond unlocking <strong>6X mode</strong> (five additional frames rendered apart from the real one), the update will also introduce <strong>an intelligent system capable of targeting your specific display's maximum refresh rate</strong>. </p>



<p>In the CES 2026 demo (featuring <strong>Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2</strong> game), the system was shown targeting the 240Hz of the 1440p display on hand. The NVIDIA rep stated:</p>



<p><em>If you went to a scene where it went up to 300 FPS, you'd see it lowering the multiplier because you'd be generating frames that are just being thrown out, right? This is a smarter way to use it. If you go up to one of the windows, the scene will get a lot lighter. You'll see your frame rate go up, and then it'll start lowering the multiplier because it'll know that you don't need that much frame generation. If you go over here, your frame rate will drop because this is a more intense scene and it's going to start raising the multiplier again.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also promises <strong>improvements in frame pacing and better accuracy in rendering in-game user interfaces</strong>, as shown in the official video above. The former will be particularly important, although we'll have to wait for its public release to test it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the popular <strong>DLSS Swapper</strong> tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-swapper-version-1-2-3-1-released-with-support-for-dlss-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just been updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</a>.</p>

Not suitable for persons under 16 years of age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Brief Outline of the Game</strong></p><p>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</p><p><strong>Content Specific Issues</strong></p><p>This game features depictions of the use of illegal drugs. During a party scene, the player is offered wine and is given the option to take a sip. The player character realizes that she has been spiked from the drink that she sipped on and is experiencing hallucinations. Images on screen become distorted and a scene plays out with the character seeing strange images. A character tells the hallucinating character that she is “tripping balls.” It is then explained that she is high on mushrooms. There are also depictions of strong, realistic violence. In the opening scene, the game recaps the previous games from the series which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso before she is then seen lying on the ground with blood seeping through her shirt. Much of the violence in the game is implied; a building is set on fire and people are heard inside screaming for help. This game also contains the use of strong language, including ‘fuck.’ Milder bad language is also present, including ‘asshole,’ ‘piss,’ and ‘shit.’</p><p><strong>Other Issues</strong></p><p>This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items in the form of new outfits and a digital deluxe upgrade, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers, or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are images in the game which may be scary to younger players, including scenes of dead bodies with no blood or injury detail and human skeletons. Some sexual innuendo is found in the game. When the player goes to a party, another character tells them that someone didn’t show up as their “girlfriend thought this was an orgy.” Suicide is referenced in the game frequently, but no depictions are shown.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q6nkau/new_possible_life_is_strange_game_leaked_life_is/" target="_blank">r/GamingLeaksandRumours</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe]]></content:encoded>

                <p>MachineGames is working on a third new Wolfenstein game to follow 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order and 2017's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.

"So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>If MachineGames is indeed working on a third Wolfenstein game in its trilogy, it could be announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">this month's Xbox Developer Direct </a>or the expected Xbox summer showcase, though these are both just guesses.</p><p>Beyond a possible new Wolfenstein game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Prime Video is producing a live-action Wolfenstein TV series</a>. It's still early days, though, and there is no word on any specifics about the show.</p><p>The Wolfenstein titles take place in an alternate timeline where Germany won World War II after they discovered advanced technology. The Wolfenstein video game series has been around since 1981, and 1992's Wolfenstein 3D from developer Id Software is credited as one of the key games that helped popularize first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GDQ’s Organizers Plan To Keep Growing The Event, But They Don’t Want It To Become Just Another Video Game Convention]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/</link>
            <guid>1399837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Compared to the PAXes or even MAGFests of the world, Awesome Games Done Quick is itsy bitsy. Around 2,000 speedrunners and fans mill about in Pittsburgh’s Wyndham Grand hotel, with a theater where speedruns take place serving as the obvious centerpiece. Other attractions – like an arcade, a game room with consoles and PCs, and a small artist alley – exist, but they feel more like brief breaks from the 24/7 speedrun deluge than fully fledged alternatives. The entire event spans just a handful of rooms across two floors. Some might view this as a downside, but I find it refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an intimacy to AGDQ that makes it feel uniquely cozy. If you make a friend, you <em>will </em>run into them again. Runners and hosts are accessible and friendly. Vocal audience participation during runs is common. The vibe is slumber party, with some audience members going so far as to wear pajamas to late-night runs.&nbsp;</p><p>In my few days attending, I’ve also come to appreciate the event’s focus: There’s one main thing pretty much everyone is here for, so we all have a shared destination and set of hyper-specific discussion topics. The standard model of a video game convention (or comic convention, or anime convention) lends itself to sprawl and bloat. They can even be actively unpleasant to attend – squirming seas of people shuffling between halls, attempting to extract amusement from vast selections of activities that rarely rise above the level of Fine.&nbsp;</p><p>AGDQ, in its current state, lacks unnecessary flab. This makes sense, considering that it began as a group of 20 friends in founder Mike Uyama’s mother’s basement. It was not born as a convention, even as it has since bolted on some of the format’s more common trappings. But that was 2010 and this is now; AGDQ attracts tens of thousands of concurrent viewers across Twitch and YouTube, and the organization behind it now employs over 100 people.&nbsp;</p><p>GDQ, meanwhile, is now far more than just one event, with AGDQ joined by Summer Games Done Quick, as well as a series of smaller charity marathons hosted by satellite organizations like Frame Fatales and Black In A Flash. Every non-event week, meanwhile, GDQ hosts regularly scheduled “Hotfix” programming, with two themed shows each weekday as well as weekend specials. There’s more to speedrunning than GDQ, but it has, in many ways, evolved into a one-stop shop for the average person’s speedrunning needs.</p><p>What does this growth mean for the event that started it all, though? GDQ director of operations Matt Merkle doesn’t plan to shy away from further expansion and experimentation.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've already actually expanded,” he told Aftermath. “The artist alley is a new addition. We just started that last summer. We have amazing artists supporting the event – the stuff they do for us to advertise the event. We wanted to bring them into the event and let people purchase their works. ... I think it's been fantastic. The community really loves that artist alley, and we'll continue to grow that as we get into bigger hotels that can support it."</p><p>But Merkle is cognizant of the fact that he’s in possession of bottled lightning.&nbsp;</p><p>“Obviously speedrunning is gonna be the primary focus of the event for the foreseeable future,” he said. “But we'll always continue to experiment with different things. Over the summer, we had a live concert, which was really cool to do for the first time. ... We definitely continue to experiment so that when people come back to the event year after year, they have something new to experience on top of the stuff that they know and love."</p><p>The show’s format, Merkle added, helps it nimbly avoid some of more traditional conventions’ biggest pitfalls.</p><p>“The event lasts for seven days rather than three or four, so you have plenty of time to experience the entire event – to go around and enjoy yourself,” he said. “We don't focus on panels as much as other conventions, so people aren't focused on just getting in lines and waiting for the panel they want to see most or something. Because we control the growth and ensure that there's always plenty of space and time to do everything, it makes it so you don't feel rushed, you don't feel cramped. You feel that you have space to do what you want and hang out with your friends."</p><p>Even as AGDQ continues to grow and attract more attendees, Merkle wants to preserve the show’s unique vibe.</p><p>“Intimacy is a core part of it,” he said.</p><p>That intimacy – and <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/rules?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a rigorous set of rules</u></a> – means people feel safe at AGDQ. This comes through whether you’re in attendance or watching along from home. What other video game event, after all, boasts “trans rights” as its rallying cry? Merkle recognizes the importance of maintaining that core component of the event as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you’re harassing anybody in our community or making people feel uncomfortable, we don’t want you here,” he said. “I think the community has come to expect that type of vibe at this event, and that’s why we have so many people that feel safe to come to these events. … We take it seriously.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq/"><div><p>Speedrunning Dog Talks To Blog - Aftermath</p><p>The story behind Awesome Games Done Quick’s speedrunning dog</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

			<p>On top of Windows Central's claim that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters/remakes would arrive "<em>eventually</em>,"</a> its executive editor, Jez Corden, also added more to the rumour mill on what Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones developer MachineGames has on the go. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">According to the report</a>, the studio is working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game, while also having Wolfenstein 3 "<em>on the cards</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, this time it's not just Windows Central claiming that Wolfenstein 3 is in development. Shortly after the initial Windows Central report, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku published its own</a>, corroborating what Windows Central claimed and, based on conversations it had with its own sources, went as far as to <strong>confirm that Wolfenstein 3 is in fact currently in development.</strong> </p>



<p>It's not shocking to hear that a new Wolfenstein game is coming from MachineGames. <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">Back in September 2025,</a> when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">NoClip</a> released a documentary on the making of the first two games, studio head <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong> said, "<em>We have always <strong>seen this as a trilogy</strong></em>. <em>That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one</em>. <em>I think that's important to say, because⁠—at least I hope⁠—we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. <strong>We have a story to tell.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>If that's not a comment meant to prime players for a coming sequel, then there's no telling what is. Gustafsson would have made that comment, fully aware of when the documentary was to be released, with full knowledge of what the studio had coming. Today's reports add further fuel to the fire that we are indeed going to get a third, and seemingly closing chapter of BJ Blazkowicz's story.</p>



<p>The last Wolfenstein game was 2019's Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which focused on Blazkowicz's daughters instead of BJ himself. If a new game in the series arrives this year, it'll have been a seven-year gap since the last game in the series and a nine-year gap since the last game to feature BJ as the protagonist. </p>



<p>Along with a new game seemingly in the works, there's also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">a TV show adaptation of Wolfenstein coming from Amazon</a>, which could likely be revealed at the same time as the third game.</p>



<p>As for the multiplayer game Corden mentions, there's not much else to go on besides the quick description that it is meant to be a "<em>Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title</em>," though if Wolfenstein 3 is going to be ready in time for the coming TV show, then that may be the project the studio is closer to completing. While the idea of a new multiplayer game from MachineGames is exciting, fans of the studio would much rather the team focus on BJ Blazkowicz before anything else.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more official news to share from the studio itself soon.</p>

            <p>
You know what I might have most about games? There's no universal way to play them. You buy a DVD, you buy a DVD player, and aside from maybe a region lock issue you're as good as gold. If I buy Snowboard Kids for the N64, and I don't have one of those, well, I'm up a particular creek. That has meant that many a game over the years has been stuck to particular platforms, one of the most surprising being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio-future">Jet Set Radio Future</a>, to this day a game that's still only available on the original Xbox, and the Xbox 360 through backwards compatibility. But! Thanks to some techy wizards, that might change in the near future.
</p>
<p>
That's because of a decompilation project that is currently underway for the North American release of the game. Now, I'm a far cry from those tech wizards I mentioned, but as far as I understand it, decompiling a game is a process where a game is taken apart so that it can be rebuilt. This allows for things like native PC ports of games that maybe never had any, which, in this case for Jet Set Radio Future, is something that could one day be an option.
</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-SEqNBjmR8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Right now, according to the project's <a href="https://codeberg.org/KeybadeBlox/JSRF-Decompilation">Codeberg page</a>, the decompilation process itself is about 30% done, but these kinds of projects normally take quite a while, so don't expect it to be finished any time soon. And again, decompiling doesn't mean that a PC port will be ready to go right out the gate either.
</p><p>
Still, it would be nice to free this one from defunct platform prison. There are obviously excellent spiritual successors like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, yet sometimes going straight to the source is what you need. It's also just a unique way to preserve a game, even if not the intended way to experience it.

<p>Over time, Valve sees that kind of support expanding to other Arm-based devices, too. “This is already fully open source, so you could download it and run SteamOS, now that we will be releasing SteamOS for Arm, you could have gaming on any Arm device,” Valve Engineer Jeremy Selan <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">told PC Gamer in November</a>. “This is the first one. We’re very excited about it.”</p>

<p>It’s an especially exciting prospect when you consider <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-gaming-handheld-3596915/">the wide range of Arm-based Android gaming handhelds</a> that currently exist across the price and performance spectrum. While <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">emulators like Fex</a> can technically let players access Steam games on those kinds of handhelds, official Arm support for SteamOS could lead to a veritable Cambrain explosion of hardware options with native SteamOS support.</p>
<p>Valve seems aware of this potential, too. “There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” Valve’s Pierre-Louis Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">told The Verge last month</a>. “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an Arm chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment. We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market.”</p>
<p>That’s great news for fans of PC-based gaming handhelds, just as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">the announcement of Valve’s Steam Machine</a> will provide a convenient option for SteamOS access on the living room TV. For desktop PC gamers, though, rigs sporting Nvidia GPUs might remain the final frontier for SteamOS in the foreseeable future. “With Nvidia, the integration of open-source drivers is still quite nascent,” Griffais <a href="https://www.frandroid.com/marques/valve/2462758_il-y-a-12-ans-de-travail-pour-en-arriver-la-interview-de-pierre-loup-griffais-developpeur-de-steamos-los-phare-du-steam-deck">told Frandroid</a> about a year ago. “There’s still a lot of work to be done on that front… So it’s a bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</p>

			<p>PlayStation has revealed a new line of DualSense controllers and PS5 side plates with its new Hyperpop Collection, which features three colourways and is arguably the boldest collection of new colours and designs that PlayStation has done with DualSense controllers and PS5 accessories since the console launched back in 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-new-faceplates-june-2022/">We've had some great solo-colour controllers and face plates</a>, but nothing so far that has tried to be a bit different outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">some limited runs of controllers featuring </a>designs <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-new-limited-edition-ps5-consoles-controllers/">based on individual games</a>. For anyone who remembers the kinds of designs and special editions we'd get back in the PS3 and PS4 days, these latest designs pale in comparison to how creative Sony and PlayStation used to get, but it's still encouraging to see them start branching out from just introducing new colours for controllers.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, we’re sharing the first look at the Hyperpop Collection, featuring three new striking designs for DualSense wireless controllers and PS5 console covers. With glossy blacks shifting into vivid neons, each finish introduces an all-new aesthetic into your gaming setup</em>," the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">reveal post on the PlayStation Blog</a> reads. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The three colours are called <strong>Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue.</strong> "<em></em><em>We’re cranking the volume all the way up with a collection that doesn’t just stand out, it takes over the room</em>," added <strong>Leo Cardoso</strong>, one of the members of Sony's design team who worked on the new collection. "<em>Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>A seamless gradient wraps around the front and back of the DualSense, finished in a high-gloss coat that makes the colors POP more than ever</em>," added <strong>Sae Kobayashi</strong>, another member of the design team. "<em></em><em>The console covers are also getting the same glow-up, featuring a subtle hint of transparency.</em>"</p>



<p>Again, it's nice to see PlayStation do more than just solid colours, though the switch to a glossy finish is quite concerning, particularly for the controllers. You may be able to install the face plates with gloves and leave them untouched, but the controllers will start getting ruined the moment you pick them up. Unless you start wearing thin gloves whenever you play your PS5.</p>



<p>The DualSense controllers and face plates will be available beginning on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> with the controllers listed at<strong> $84.99 USD/¥12,480 (including tax)/€84.99/£74.99</strong>, and the face plates listed at <strong>$74.99 USD/¥11,480(including tax)/€74.99/£64.99</strong>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Enjoy Discord While You Can]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The case between Rockstar and fired <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers who were unionizing gets messier. Discord is secretly preparing for a possible IPO. And Square Enix might ban you if you share <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> spoilers. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I’m trying to go into this new year by once again <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coreybrickley.bsky.social/post/3mbtmvsb7xs2l">limiting my social media intake</a>. There are a lot of cool things that get shared around and I love to see, and also too much of anything will kill you. Curated feeds. Strict time limits. This is the way.</p>

 <h2>Discord is getting closer to an IPO</h2> <p>Bloomberg reports that the gaming chat platform “filed confidentially for an initial public offering.” While that doesn’t guarantee it will move forward with a Wall Street stock offering, it does suggest the company has moved <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">another rung up the ladder toward enshittification</a>. Discord recently boasted over 200 million monthly users and has promised to remain a user-first enterprise that doesn’t monetize its audience for short-term gain. We’ll see!</p>

 <h2>Rockstar shares new details about the unionizing <em>GTA 6</em> developers it fired</h2> <p>Claims were heard from both sides at a labor tribunal this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. Rockstar also shed more light on the union-focused Discord that developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">were chatting in before they were fired</a>.&nbsp;“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members,” the company said in a statement to <em>IGN</em>.&nbsp;“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.”</p>

 <p>While the IWGB has claimed only union business was discussed, Rockstar maintains that game features were also leaked. “We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does,” its new statement continued. “Global interest in our games is unparalleled.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar went on, “Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p>

 <h2>The free <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> demo is out</h2> <p>Players will get an in-game reward for trying it, and save progress carries over to the final game which is out on console and PC on February 5. Be careful, though, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-bans-posting-certain-parts-of-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-for-a-month-after-the-demos-launch-with-strict-guidelines-on-spoilers/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Square Enix is threatening to ban anyone who potentially posts <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq7r/">unmarked spoilers</a> for the remake of 25-year-old game. The spoiler warnings will continue until morale improves.</p>

 <h2><em>Fallout</em> season 3 starts filming in just a few months</h2> <p>Amazon is wasting no time getting the next batch of episodes for its hit TV adaptation of the RPG series going. According to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">new production alert</a>, filming will resume in May.</p> <h2><em>Balatro</em> and <em>Silksong</em> prove conventional wisdom can’t always predict hits</h2> <p>That’s one of the points NYU professor Joost van Dreunen made in a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry">with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The success of a <em>Balatro</em>, a <em>Silksong</em>: These are all games that shouldn’t really exist,” he said. “They don’t make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved and commercially very viable and popular.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws-2000657166">Some big blockbusters are headed to Xbox Game Pass this month</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176">What Logan Paul doesn’t get about Pokémon</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fantasy-fps-where-you-shoot-skeletons-to-stop-the-game-from-crashing-looks-incredible-2000657233"><em>FPS Quest</em> is a neat-sounding game with an incredible trailer</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>If you're a fan of visiting multiple maps for a single quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, boy do we have some objectives for you. For the Eyes in the Sky quest, you'll be tasked with heading to three different maps to place LiDAR Scanners, and getting all of them done is going to take a bit of skill, luck, and a zipline. Let's talk about it.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete any portion of Eyes in the Sky, so you can go in with a free loadout for the Dam Battlegrounds and Spaceport objectives. However, you will need a zipline to reach the necessary spot on Buried City, so you may want to suit up for that one.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle this quest, follow the guide below.</p><h2 id="On_Dam_Battlegrounds__install_a_LiDAR_Scanner_at_the_top_of_the_Control_Tower">On Dam Battlegrounds, install a LiDAR Scanner at the top of the Control Tower</h2><p>The first LiDAR Scanner you need to install is likely to be the most dangerous of them all. To complete this objective, you'll need to visit the high-traffic and PVP-centric Control Tower POI in the middle of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134" data-ratio="0.56484641638225" data-width="2344" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134"></a><figcaption>Control Tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg"></figure><p>This POI is frequently riddled with PVPers and folks trying to use their keys to open doors inside the building. With that in mind, don't be surprised if you've got to take out a few folks before you get to where you're going.</p><p>There are multiple entrances into this POI, but one of the safest options is to approach this building from the south. You should spot some stairs on the side of the building. Take them up until you reach the main floor (don't go all the way up).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631135"></a><figcaption>Take the first three flights of stairs up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg"></figure><p>Run toward the door down the long outside hallway.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631136"></a><figcaption>Run straight ahead from here through the door on the other end of this long outdoor hallway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg"></figure><p>Inside, continue straight to spot a breachable door. If someone has already been through here, the door may be open already, as in the photo below. If not, you'll need to breach it quickly and hope no one comes up behind you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631138"></a><figcaption>You may need to breach this door if it's not already open.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg"></figure><p>With the door open, you'll notice ziplines going up and down. Take the one that heads upward, but before you take it, <strong>look straight up and shoot any turrets that may be along the walls above you</strong>, as they'll rip you to shreds if you take the zipline up before they're killed.</p><p>If someone's been through here already, you may not see any turrets. This can be a good or bad thing. Since there's a very popular key room on the floor above you, it's possible someone has already gone up and entered that room, and they'll often set traps at the top of the zipline to alert them of any potential threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140"></a><figcaption>Taking the zipline up can be dangerous, as there may be traps or other raiders waiting at the top.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg"></figure><p>If you go up and set off any traps, it's a good idea to immediately call out that you're friendly and just questing to calm other raiders' nerves. But in cases where the person is aggressive, you may have to fight back. In the worst case scenario, you'll die and have to load back in to try again--but the best case scenario is that you eliminate someone and get some sweet loot for it. </p><p>However this situation plays out, the key room on the right in the linear corridor isn't your main goal. Instead, you'll want to make your way through the corridor until you reach another breachable door at the top of some stairs. Once it's opened, you'll have access to the Control Tower roof.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631139"></a><figcaption>Breach the door at the top of the stairs to access the roof.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg"></figure><p>On the Control Tower roof, head forward and slightly left to spot a tripod.

This quest asks you to go to Buried City, Dam Battlegrounds, and Spaceport to search for specific things, and rounding up the correct spots to visit can be a challenge if you're not familiar with the maps yet. That's alright, though--that's where we come in.</p><p>Keep in mind that, since you won't need to extract with any items to complete any steps in What We Left Behind, you can comfortably head in with a free loadout to avoid risking any of your good loot. But, of course, you're also welcome to bring your best stuff if you'd rather be ready for a fight.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, here's how to complete each step of What We Left Behind.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</a></li><li><a href="#On_Dam_Battlegrounds__search_for_anything_significant_in_the_South_Swamp_Outpost">On Dam Battlegrounds, search for anything significant in the South Swamp Outpost</a></li><li><a href="#On_Spaceport__search_for_anything_significant_in_Bilguun_s_Hideout__next_to_the_Container_Storage">On Spaceport, search for anything significant in Bilguun's Hideout, next to the Container Storage</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</h2><p>The first part of the quest sends you to the Parking Garage on the northwestern side of Buried City.

Preorders will open on January 16 ahead of their March 12 launch.</p><p>Like the console covers, the DualSense controllers will be available in three distinct colorways. Techno Red is a loud, vibrant option that fades to a glossy black at the top. First released in November 2020, the DualSense controller features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a Create Button for when you want to quickly grab in-game screenshots and video clips. Remix Green also pops nicely on the DualSense controller, with this particular shade being an instant attention-grabber. While it's also a bright color, Rhythm Blue is a touch softer than the two options above it. The blue tones give the DualSense controller a <em>slightly </em>subdued and calmer effect.</p><div title="6537254 -- Hyperpop Collection Console Covers" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5388"
