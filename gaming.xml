            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Musicians have announced the United Videogame Workers Union, the first North American industry-wide union that any employee working within the field can join.</p>

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the open market tomorrow, and Japan’s government is eagerly discussing whether to address certain scenes in the game on a legal level. The most controversial scenes in Assassin’s Creed Shadows were revealed as Yasuke, an African samurai, desecrating and destroying shines, which drew intense blowback from the Japanese people.</p>



<p>In a Diet discussion today, the Japanese government – including Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru – brought up the question of what to do about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ scandalous sequences.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-assassin-s-creed-issue">‘The Assassin’s Creed Issue’</h2>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (circulated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) breaks down the discussion in the Diet, which was centred around the legality of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, raised concerns about ‘the Assassin’s Creed issue’, highlighting sequences that see Yasuke devastate a revered shrine in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the necessary bodies in Japan are ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation, as they’re intently concerned about possible copycat attacks on shrines across the country. The government is also concerned about tourist pollution, worried that the eventual success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could see these shrines flooded with visitors.</p>



<p>Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s Prime Minister, had some tough words on the matter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lobby found a clear issue with the destruction of Japanese culture and facilities in this game, claiming that it wasn’t possible to replicate such acts in previous games. It’s not clear what their plans are beyond monitoring the situation, but it was noted that the Prime Minister’s comments, however strict, aren’t indicative of further action.</p>



<p>Before this, the existence of Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also subject to intense speculation and scrutiny, with many highlighting his dubious and unclear historical position and the accuracy of his character. </p>

                <p>Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe changed the face of the movie industry with its series of interconnected films, a video game version of this concept was once pitched to Disney, according to Bungie co-founder Alexander Seropian.</p><p>On an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, Seropian and his guest Alex Irvine revealed (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/there-was-once-an-idea-for-a-marvel-gaming-universe-that-would-tie-all-the-video-games-together-like-the-mcu-but-it-didnt-get-funded" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>) how they'd come up with a plan to create a connected universe for future Marvel games, but Disney higher-ups decided to pass on the idea. Seropian--who was VP of game development for Disney's game division until 2012--and Irvine--who has writing credits on several Marvel games--added that funding for the idea never materialized, killing the idea early on in its development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_W6fCpdYs4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, 'Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?' There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game," Seropian explained. "We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games."</p><p>Irvine added that it was also a challenge to make the proposed Marvel video game universe stand out from the comics and film adaptations, and in the end, the idea was scrapped. Currently, Marvel video games from Spider-Man to Guardians of the Galaxy all exist in their own distinct universes, and the only exception to the rule is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-ps5-spider-man-and-wolverine-are-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/1100-6518742/" data-ref-id="1100-6518742">Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game</a>, as it'll be set in the same Earth-1048 reality that the web-slinger calls home.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-version-1-0-launches-april-14-on-pc-and-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish developer Far From Home has unveiled the launch date for Forever Skies. The action survival game has been in early access on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-early-access-has-been-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since June 2023</a>, garnering decent but not huge interest from the community. According to estimates based on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1641960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB data</a>, there might be between 164K and 277K owners of the game.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is now set to debut on Monday, April 14, on PC and PlayStation 5. Pre-orders for Sony's console are now live <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10004499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a>, including a Deluxe Edition that gives PlayStation players the chance to purchase the game, gain a collection of cosmetic airship decoration items, and start playing the game three days early (from April 11).</p>
<p>Far From Home has mentioned the following features as the biggest improvements players will find in version 1.0 of Forever Skies:</p>
<p><em>● Biomes: evolving the game’s procedural world with more cohesive environments</em><br>
<em>● Advanced Airship Building: players will find new designs, upgrades, and cosmetics to</em><br>
<em>customize their airship</em><br>
<em>● New Locations: adding to the adventure with new location types and places to explore</em><br>
<em>● … and the final story chapter, where players will be faced with an unprecedented and</em><br>
<em>chilling decision.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mpizsm3m1-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Forever Skies, players are scientists returning to Earth long after a global ecological disaster has rendered the planet uninhabitable. They fly in a high-tech airship high above the toxic clouds that are the remnants of humanity's last stand. The airship is the player's home, workshop, and laboratory. After collecting resources, they must manage the airship hull and integrity and improve it.</p>
<p>Of course, exploration and discovery of the remains of humanity's civilization are a big part of the game. Players will find out what happened and why the Earth evolved into a place where humans lost control of their former position at the top. After descending beneath the dust, they discover a strange new world. The surface of the planet has changed in the absence of humanity and is now inhabited by evolved fauna and flora. As scientists, players must hunt viral pathogens to cure a mysterious disease. The game is playable solo or with up to four players in the co-op mode that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added in December 2024</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossplay-update-released-full-patch-notes-revealed.1138923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has released the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update, and as you can probably imagine, it adds crossplay to the creature-collecting survival game, as well as more Pal storage and lots of other goodies.</p>

<p>The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march" rel="nofollow">announced last week</a> that the update would be coming sometime in late March, and while it's up for debate whether the 19th constitutes "late March", the update is here, and there's plenty to enjoy.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised, the main attraction in this update is crossplay; you can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>alongside your friends on other platforms, and every platform is supported, so PC players can play with PlayStation and Xbox gamers, who can also enjoy the game with one another.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=y205TYic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=1CZFIF73 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s crossplay update has arrived, and it's letting you play with your friends on different platforms at last.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the update's name, however, crossplay isn't all it's bringing. You can now transfer Pals between worlds using the new Global Palbox feature, and you'll also find that there's a new Pal storage system with "10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox".</p>

<p>A new cosmetic armor system has also been added, so you can switch up your look without worrying about whether your stats will be affected. You can also take advantage of the new Photo Mode if you want a snap of yourself wearing your new snazzy threads.</p>

<p>Other new features include a new drafting table that lets you combine multiple lower-rarity blueprints for a higher one, as well as lots of balance adjustments and bug fixes. It's worth reading the full patch notes if you want to know everything, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/571499455390418195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>




<p><em>Palworld</em>'s latest update comes as developer Pocketpair continues to fight a legal battle against Nintendo, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">suing the indie developer</a> over several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">allegedly infringed patents</a>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit did not, however, stop Pocketpair from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">granting its employees the day off</a> last month to mark the release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which the studio jokingly suggested its employees would simply call in sick to play anyway.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its latest update right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A mobile version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">also in development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The state of video game hardware continues to be somewhat bleak across the board. After falling 45% year-over-year in January, video game hardware sales fell 25% year-over-year for February 2025.</p>



<p>The drop from $341 million to $256 million is the “lowest February total for video game hardware sales spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020”. That, according to Circana and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie744m2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>When looking into specifics, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) was the best-selling console in terms of both units sold and dollar amount. The Xbox Series systems came in second in both metrics.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, that also saw a fall of 8% from $248M to $228M year-over-year. After two months of sales data, accessory spending is 18% behind 2024’s pace. A big reason for that, according to Circana’s data, is that controller spending has fallen 17% and headset spending has dropped off 25%.</p>



<p>As far as what remains a top seller, the PlayStation Portal’s base model was February’s best-selling accessory in terms of dollars spent.</p>



<p>Seeing the continued trend of falling hardware sales shouldn’t be surprising to many in, and around, the industry. It seems pretty clear that players either already have the system they want or there’s simply a desire to spend their money elsewhere as a result of increased cost of living. </p>



<p>It should be expected that hardware sales will get an uptick during the year when Nintendo releases its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system in the coming months.</p>

And with it came a flood of <a title="Genres > Horror [579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s: demons seeking human host bodies to possess.

Before the disaster, she was a lonely teenager growing up in this company town. Going to a high school run by a tech company seemed completely normal to her. Now, the only thing keeping her alive is Rhem, a powerful, bitter demon who escaped Agradyne’s clutches. Rhem agreed to possess Luca to save both of their lives. But all Rhem wants is to return home, so Luca has promised to help.</p><p>​<br>As Luca and Rhem search for answers, they learn what it means to take and lose control.

New worlds filled with untold wonders. Eden reincarnate. It'll also slash production costs and save the game industry from certain death.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you speak to those in the trenches of production, the answer might be slightly different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Offering his take on the increasingly polarizing technology at GDC 2025, EA software engineer David 'Rez' Graham suggests the best case scenario would see generative AI handle menial tasks while human beings focus on creative pursuits. What's the worse case scenario? How about the death of art.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After discussing the well-documented legal issues surrounding the training of popular generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Dall-E, and how in their current guise those technologies look like a hammer in search of a nail, Graham asks a pointed question: what is our intent here?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says generative AI isn't inherently evil—but can be used by corporations who might have some rather unseemly intentions. Case in point: the tech startup Artisan, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/artisan-stop-hiring-humans-billboards-19976095.php">advertised its AI tools in San Francisco</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with slogans such as "stop hiring humans" and "Artisans won't complain about work-life balance."

Let me rephrase that. What value do they provide the world?" asks Graham, seeking to drive home his point. "I don't think it's typing. I don't think that's their value." The answer, in case it wasn't obvious, is they tell stories.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Graham explains the value of artists isn't just "smearing pixels on a screen," but rather to be visual experts. Programmers aren't paid to type code. "That's the easy part," he says. They're paid to solve difficult technical problems that might otherwise derail projects. In short: you hire people for their ingenuity. For their ability to defy convention.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where does AI fit into that equation?

This is incredibly useful. It's a really good thing—but it is not creative. That is not what creativity is. It's not going to create Into the Spider-Verse. That artistic style? It's not going to do that unless it's trained on that kind of stuff. It's simply never going to. We already have some lack of innovation in triple-A games. We all know it. We all see it.

            <p>It has been six years and a bit since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first announced, and ever since then we have been seeking out any crumb of information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since that now slightly hazy day of February 2019</a>, developer Team Cherry has kept release details under relative wraps (although in January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">did try and assure us that Silksong is "real, progressing and will release"</a>).</p>
<p>But, when will it be released, Team Cherry? When? You tell me it is real, but where is the proof? I need hard evidence, Cherry! (Ok, I am jesting slightly here.) But, while I may need further reassurance, Microsoft is clearly still confident the game will eventually show up, namechecking it as part of a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/">post</a> about its ID@Xbox program.</p>

<p>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games," Xbox writes, before highlighting titles such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belle-epoque-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-april-release-date">which is slated for an April release</a>) and Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak was announced in October last year</a>, and has a release window of 2025.</p>
<p>And as well as those? "Of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" Microsoft states.</p>
<p>Does this mean Hollow Knight: Silksong may be releasing soon? Ahh, alas, I doubt its inclusion in Xbox's post really means anything more than Microsoft is having a playful joke with those of us who are wanting to hear more. But then again, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025"><em>maybe </em>2025 will finally be the year Silksong flies onto platforms</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/circana-us-sales-data-for-february-2025-shows-monster-hunter-wilds-is-king.1138875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analyst group Circana has released its sales data for February, and you'll never be able to guess which phenomenally popular action RPG managed to top the all-format charts.</p>

<p>That's right: according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai3ibbc2p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was February's best-selling game, despite launching on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">very last day of the month</a>. Of course, given that it took&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">just three days to break eight million sales</a>, we probably shouldn't be surprised about that.</p>

<p>In second place, according to Piscatella's data, is Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">two million sales in less than two weeks</a>. Not bad for what is effectively a fairly niche medieval RPG.</p>

<p>In fourth place is golf sim&nbsp;<em>PGA Tour 2K25</em>, with basketball game&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>in fifth and perennially popular shooter&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>in sixth (appropriately enough).</p>

<p>Seventh place for the month is a new entry in Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, but Microsoft probably isn't too worried about a low placement like that given that the game is also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>Bringing up the last three places in the top ten for February are&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, the latter demonstrating the sheer staying power of EA's sporting franchises (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">well, sometimes, anyway</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=MyGKAb9r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=vfkBbUGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>is still hanging on in there, according to Circana's data.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to specific platforms, <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>was the best-selling game on Playstation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8&nbsp;</em>topping the Switch charts (because&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Switch, of course).</p>

<p>In hardware terms, it probably won't shock you to learn that the PS5, which recently passed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">75 million lifetime sales</a>, was February's best-selling console in both unit and dollar terms, with Xbox bringing up second place.</p>

It’s a tiny yellow square, not much bigger than a credit card, with a black-and-white screen and a crank that juts out of its side. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview">It looks like a Game Boy from a parallel world</a>. And, much like with the DS and its contemporaries, those limitations and distinct features have inspired a library of games unlike anything I’ve ever played: everything from a strategy game about cryptid photography and a turn-based samurai adventure to a role-playing game where all you do is manage inventory.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjMyNDE4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632418/playdate-price-increase-panic-malaysia">The Playdate is about to get a price increase</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Don’t Panic, the Playdate now has a matching power adapter.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1h7z76e/new_accessory_us_standard_ac_adapter/">Reddit user discovered</a> that Panic has <a href="https://play.date/shop/ac-adapter/">quietly introduced a 10W AC adapter</a> that matches the Playdate handheld’s bright yellow aesthetic.

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February 2025 in the United States (US), knocking Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the top spot after four months.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqahyb5hk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, four of the top five games from February were brand new releases. Coming in second was Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 while Civilization 7 and PGA Tour 2K25 were third and fourth, respectively. Rounding out the top five was NBA 2K25, which fell from second.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finished sixth.</p>



<p>Regarding new game releases, six releases found their way into the top 10 for February after just one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-was-january-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the top 20</a> in January. Aside from what was mentioned above, the other new games that made February’s list of best sellers were Avowed at seven and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii at eight.</p>



<p>Lastly, a number of games that found themselves near the top of the sales charts for months have continued to fall. In addition to the aforementioned Call of Duty and NBA 2K25, EA Sports College Football 25 has fallen out of the top 10 for the first time, coming in at 16th compared to seventh. The only game to stay in its same spot from month to month is Elden Ring at 18.</p>

<p>A game called Plants vs Zombies Reloaded has been rated by the Brazil rating board, sparking discussion that a remaster of the original could be in development.</p>



<p>The rating, which simply says “Plants vs Zombies Reloaded” was rated for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile with an ‘L’ rating.</p>



<p>Plants vs Zombies was first developed and published by PopCap Games in May 2009 and later was acquired by EA in July 2011. Despite the initial game being a success and multiple spin-offs and a few sequels, the Plants vs Zombies community has criticized the developers for not replicating the success of the original game.</p>



<p>“I hope it means ea (or popcap idk if they can make decisions by themselves) will get his shit together to deliver a proper sequel in the future but at this point the mere thought of it falls into hopium territory, they fumbled the franchise so hard that it hurts,” said Reddit user kdk_2002.</p>



<p>“Thankfully you don’t have to even look to EA, I sure as hell don’t, since the fans have taken it upon themselves to continue PvZ and have made a plethora of great mods expanding upon PvZ1 and PvZ2. We’re eating good and not giving EA a dime, as it should be until they deliver something actually worth paying for,” said another user.</p>

That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves and with the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is evidence of the trend, then. But it wasn’t the only new release in February to do well. In fact, according to Circana’s data, the top four best-selling games of February 2025 were new releases, with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, and PGA Tour 2K25 joining Monster Hunter Wilds. Other new releases appearing among the month’s top 10 best-sellers included Obsidian’s Avowed, which also launched day-one into Game Pass, and Sega’s Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana said the launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than five times higher than the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance achieved during its February 2018 debut. Embracer Group, parent company of Kingdom Come: Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down-sells-2-million-copies-in-less-than-2-weeks">has already hailed the sequel’s sales success</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">February 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>NEW Monster Hunter: Wilds - Capcom USA</li><li>NEW Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Plaion</li><li>NEW Civilization VII - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NEW PGA Tour 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NBA 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>NEW Avowed - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Sega</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Madden NFL 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Minecraft - Multiple Video Game Manufacturers</li><li>EA Sports FC 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Sony (Corp)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy - Warner Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-sales-are-outpacing-ps4-in-the-us-xbox-series-x-and-s-lags-well-behind-xbox-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a mixed picture for video game console sales in the United States, with the PlayStation 5 still outpacing its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, but the Xbox Series X and S lagging far behind the Xbox One.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the most recent data from Circana, after each platform’s first 52 months in the market, PS5 unit sales exceed PS4’s sales pace by 7%, while Xbox Series X and S combined now trails Xbox One by 19%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As positive as the picture is for Sony’s console effort in the U.S., especially as it comes without a PS5 price cut, it's yet more depressing news for Microsoft. The Xbox Series consoles have for some time struggled for sales globally, and Microsoft has admitted it lost the so-called console war a long time ago in the face of competition from PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, of course, takes a bigger picture view when it comes to determining the success of its gaming business. It looks to PC as a major growth area, is pushing its subscription service Game Pass across multiple devices, and is launching many of its Xbox games on rival consoles in a bid to boost its bottom line. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, for example, will hit PS5 soon, as will Forza Horizon 5. Doom: The Dark Ages, meanwhile, is set to launch on PS5 at the same time as PC and Xbox in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been questions over whether Microsoft might call it a day for Xbox consoles as a result of the failure of the Xbox Series X and S, but the company was recently reported to have green lit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025">a next-gen Xbox for release in 2027, as well as an Xbox handheld during the same year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This console is reportedly a premium successor to the Xbox Series X, and alongside a first-party Xbox gaming handheld and new controllers will allegedly round out Microsoft’s console offering in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central</a> reported that the next-gen Xbox will be more like a PC than any Xbox before it, and will support third-party storefronts such as Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Continued backwards compatibility is a given.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console"><u>Xbox president Sarah Bond said</u></a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation."</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is much speculation around the future of consoles generally. As mentioned, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-data-suggests-that-ps5-has-outsold-xbox-series-xs-2-to-1"><u>Xbox Series X and S are floundering</u></a> in the ‘console war,’ and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-entering-the-latter-stage-of-its-life-cycle-sony-says"><u>Sony has suggested PlayStation 5 is approaching the second half of its life</u></a>. While Nintendo is set to launch Switch 2 later this year, there is growing concern that the traditional video game console business could be under threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said in interviews that the console business has failed to grow meaningfully in recent years, offering a sizable but static customer base that is increasingly playing a handful of enormous games and leaving little room for everything else. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN</u></a> that Microsoft would have been discussing whether consoles have a future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Circana’s data, console sales are in a slump right now. February video game hardware spending fell by 25% when compared to a year ago, to $256 million. That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month across both units and dollars. Xbox Series ranked second in both measures. Accessories spending in February declined by 8% when compared to a year ago, to $220 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The industry overall is having a particularly tough time. February 2025 projected U.S. consumer spending across video game hardware, content, and accessories declined 6% when compared to a year ago, to $4.5 billion. Spending so far this year is 11% lower than at the same point in 2024, at $9.0 billion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game content spending, specifically, fell 4% compared to a year ago, to $4 billion. Non-mobile subscription spending growth of 9% was offset by declines in mobile (-4%), as well as full game and add-on content spending across both console (-11%), and the PC, cloud and non-console VR (-4%) segments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there is hope things will improve this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-will-sell-loads-of-switch-2-consoles-at-launch-regardless-of-price-analysts-predict-june-release-date-once-again-mentioned">Some analysts have said the Nintendo Switch 2 could be the biggest console launch of all time irrespective of its price</a>. And then there’s the looming behemoth that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still set for release in fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S only, and could end up as the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">he expects GTA 6 to spark a surge in console sales</a>. “When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has deployed another rather chunky patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>.</p>
<p>On the game's initial launch last year, Stalker 2 was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>. "You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. </p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-second-major-patch-adds-1700-improvements-and-fixes">remained committed to sorting the game's various niggles</a> and what not since then, with two already sizeable patches already out there, and this most recent update is a continuation of that. </p>
<p>Patch 1.3, as it is known, comes with "over 1200 changes and improvements" to all aspects of the game, including performance, combat and more.</p>
<p>With this patch in play, Stalker 2 players will notice multiple new death screens which "vary based on the cause of the death", as well as improved facial animations, a new night music theme for Slag Heap and a new type of a visual anomaly.</p>
<p>On the combat side of things, GSC has made mutant movements during combat smoother and improved the reaction of NPCs to the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes via the Stalker 2 website here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Communications Workers of America (CWA) – the union that represents over 2,000 workers across companies like Microsoft, Activision, Bethesda, and Zenimax – is announcing a new industry-wide union called United Videogame Workers-CWA. Unlike unions that have been studio- or discipline-specific, this one is open to <em>all </em>video game workers in the United States and Canada, regardless of employment status.</p><p>UVW-CWA is rooted in the tradition of direct-join unionism, which means the union itself isn’t certified by any particular government or company, allowing anyone to join. As a result, this type of union doesn’t have the same type of legal leverage that something organized in accordance with modern laws and strictures might. But, as Emma Kinema, one of the original game devs behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Workers_Unite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2018 Game Workers Unite campaign</a> and current CODE-CWA senior campaign lead, wrote in a zine explaining the rationale behind UVW-CWA, the law isn’t exactly on workers’ side these days.</p><p>"With the tumultuous start of the second Trump Administration, two of the agencies that workers rely on to protect their rights and hold corporations accountable – the Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – are under attack,” she wrote. “Between Trump’s illegal firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, Elon Musk challenging the National Labor Relations Act as unconstitutional, and huge tech giants like Amazon already using the vacant NLRB as grounds to reject union wins, it’s clear that Trump and the billionaire class he represents are working day and night to dismantle labor laws and put even more power back in the hands of corporations. We can no longer expect to rely on traditional legal frameworks to build worker power and to improve workplace conditions.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>If the right-wing, reactionary government that we increasingly have wants to start stripping away that process, they're going to quickly remember that, actually, the NLRB and NLRA are a peace treaty between workers and bosses.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In an interview with Aftermath, Kinema added that many of history’s most notable labor victories were won outside of a standard legal framework.</p><p>"For two-thirds of modern industrial history, there were no legal forms of unions,” she said. “They were just humans coming together to organize as best as they could in leverage against their employers for better conditions. Only once you arrive at the 1935 National Labor Relations Act do you get private section union frameworks where you can get certified, have majority collective bargaining rights, etc. And if the right-wing, reactionary government that we increasingly have wants to start stripping away that process, they're going to quickly remember that, actually, the NLRB and NLRA are a peace treaty between workers and bosses; the legal framework for unionism that people have gotten used to over the past 80 years is a peace treaty, and it cuts both ways.”</p><p>UVW-CWA also takes aim at another pressing issue currently facing the video game industry: layoffs. The union is kicking off a campaign at GDC with a petition about layoffs it plans to pass around, but more broadly, this new structure provides a means by which designers, programmers, artists, QA testers, and every other discipline under the sun can join the movement even if they’re not currently employed.</p><p>"One of the nice things about a direct-join model is, the company doesn't get to define or say who is in the union. The government doesn't have a say in who's in the union,” Kinema said. “So we can define the union as broadly as we want, and for us we're saying it's all workers. Whether you're a direct-hire employee at a major company, you're at an indie studio, you're a freelancer or contractor, or you're unemployed, it doesn't matter. If you're in and of the industry, you belong in the union. You deserve to have a voice in the movement."</p><p>Kinema pointed to the history of the United Auto Workers – now one of the most influential unions in the country – which began outside the bounds of formal unionization and bargaining rights.</p><p>"A lot of people look to the '30s and '40s as the heyday, the golden era of labor organizing in the United States, right? You get the GM/Flint sit-down strikes of '37 and the steel strikes – all sorts of different things," she said. "People take away valuable lessons, but the wrong lessons in some ways, like 'Oh, you need to map out social leaders' and 'You need to do this and that kind of recruitment' and 'These are the kinds of conversations [the Congress of Industrial Organizations] had.' But they were also organizing a direct-join model, where if someone wanted to support the campaign, if they wanted to be in the union, they would just join. They would become a member, they would get trained up, they would have leadership. They would have actions and things, skirmishes with the companies. It's a more powerful, flexible, and accessible model of organizing."</p><figure><blockquote><p>If you're in and of the industry, you belong in the union. You deserve to have a voice in the movement.</p></blockquote></figure><p>That’s more or less what UVW-CWA is hoping to accomplish with the video game industry, in which <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/game-developers-are-more-interested-in-unions-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a majority of workers approve of unions</a>, but only a small minority are able to participate in them. Make no mistake, though, this is not just a loosely affiliated conglomerate of workers; it is a union with dues and all the rest.</p><p>"There are dues,” Kinema said. “$15 USD is the minimum, and then it ranges to one percent income, depending on how you define it. It's all honor system, of course, and it's self-deducted, self-raised. It's not through payroll or anything like that, like a typical union campaign would be. The idea is, we can build leverage and power together by building our resources, by building community, by building a new cadre of organizers in the industry with new experience based off the last several years of organizing."</p><p>This approach takes inspiration from preexisting unions in other countries, like <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IWGB Game Workers Union</a>, the largest union for game devs in the UK at over 1,500 members, which also relies on direct-join unionism. Austin Kelmore, IWGB Game Workers co-founder and chair of the branch, told Aftermath that direct-join unionism allowed the union to reach its current size in just a couple years, but there are potential downsides – such as members expecting a service during times of tumult.</p><p>"[Workers] join the union and think they've done what they need to do to improve the industry, and the union will support them if anything comes up," said Kelmore. "This service model for trade unions is easy to fall into and is one of the reasons why unions have lost so much power in the previous decades. ... It's impossible to support an entire industry's workers with staff hired with the small amounts of membership dues we collect. So the challenge, then, is to talk with workers and let them know the power of a union comes from the workers, not the staff. We prefer an organizing model where the workers build power together and push for change themselves. So far, many of our members have been receptive to that message, which fills me with excitement at what we can accomplish together."  </p><p>Despite all the talk of sticking it to elected officials and bosses – and the unholy hybrid of the two that Trump and Musk’s intertwining serpent tongues represent – Kinema believes that this new approach is plenty compatible with the trail workers and CWA have blazed at companies like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>"By no means do we think the direct-join model and the certification model are mutually exclusive to each other. We think they can complement each other, actually, and expand upon each other,” Kinema said. “Part of it is going to be welcoming this new influx of people into the movement through this direct-join model and then giving them the training and education and onboarding such that they can still turn around and do meaningful organizing that doesn't put them at risk in an unnecessary way."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>To be attacked by the enemy is to be respected by the enemy.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s a big moment for CWA, both in terms of potential growth and possible consequences. While Kinema acknowledged that the government could simply declare membership in UVW-CWA illegal, she believes that's unlikely. However, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has repeatedly rattled his saber in CWA’s direction, going so far as to accuse the union of masterminding Blizzard’s 2021 legal woes in an effort to juice membership during <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-unfair-labor-practice-guns-cwa-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent podcast</a>.</p><p>Kinema finds that perversely encouraging.</p><p>“To be attacked by the enemy is to be respected by the enemy,” she said. "When the boss starts to get scared, when they get nervous, when they start putting out statements, when they start putting out lies, when they start putting pressure on, that's a sign that you're doing something right. That's a sign that you're moving the needle. You're changing the industry for real. I think it's in the psyche of a lot of bosses now that the 'threat' of unionization is on the horizon for them if they don't tread lightly, if they don't treat their workers with care.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
