            <p>After a long period of dormancy, the Legacy of Kain franchise is poised to make a return as a prequel graphic novel.</p>
<p>This graphic novel is known as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise, and earlier this week Crystal Dynamics revealed the project had surpassed $1m in Kickstarter funding.</p>
<p>"This is more than just a milestone - it's proof of the power of this community," Crystal Dynamics celebrated on social media platform X. "We're beyond grateful. Let's keep the momentum going!"</p>

<p>This particular Legacy of Kain project was first announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/">several months ago</a>, and promises readers the chance to "discover an untold tale", as the graphic novel bridges the gaps between Blood Omen and Soul Reaver.</p>
<p>"Readers will discover Raziel's origins as a human child, the events that led him to join the Sarafan, and the mysterious emergence of his wings," reads the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel?ref=dtv72k">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
<p>"The graphic novel offers fresh insights into the lore, revisiting iconic moments and characters like Kain, Moebius, and Raziel's brothers, while introducing new faces such as Elaleth, whose connections to Raziel, Kain, and the Hylden bring unexpected twists to the tale."</p>
<p>If you are interested in backing the project, there is still time. The Kickstarter will end in a little over two weeks from the time of writing.</p> <div>

<p>Fans have been hopeful for a series remaster of sorts following some perhaps unintentional teases from the developer in recent months.</p>
<p>Along with the upcoming re-release of both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-legacy-of-kain-games-will-be-re-released-for-evercade-next-month">Evercade retro handheld console</a>, logos for an unannounced "Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel</a> during a Comic-Con event held in San Diego earlier this year.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Crystal Dynamics sent out a survey asking if recipients would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">interested in seeing the Legacy of Kain series make a comeback</a>. This survey followed an announcement from the developer that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-now-has-control-of-tomb-raider-following-square-enix-sale">regained "control" of its Legacy of Kain series</a>, as well as that of the Tomb Raider IP, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix's sale of its Western studios</a> (which included Crystal Dynamics) to Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-announced-alongside-developer-revival.965994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>British studio Argonaut has announced a&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster, and as you might imagine given that it's making an announcement, Argonaut itself is being revived as well.</p>
<p>Describing itself as a "legendary studio known for bringing its pioneering 3D technology to a 2D gaming world" back in the 80s, Argonaut says it's making a return after "a 20-year hiatus", although "hiatus" seems a strange word to use given the studio closed its doors in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say it's making a "grand comeback as a boutique publisher" and that it's got a "planned slate of classic Argonaut IP" in the works, starting with a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-argonaut-platforming.jpg?itok=2X54HITk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-argonaut-platforming.jpg?itok=BuXJy_8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Croc is back, in remaster form.</figcaption></figure><p>According to a press release on the <a href="https://www.argonautgames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official Argonaut website</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>remaster will come complete with "enhanced HD graphics", as well as "updated modern control mechanics". Hopefully, we can still play with the original's lovably janky tank controls.</p>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>you're getting with this remaster, though; you're also getting access to the "Crocipedia", a repository of&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>development assets including design documents, concept art, and more. Honestly, that's a win for preservation however you slice it.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this inspires a revival of&nbsp;<em>Croc 2</em>, which deserves to make a comeback. In the meantime, however, you can check out the reveal trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster right here.</p>

<p>Croc is the latest in a string of platforming mascots from the late fifth console generation era to be revived for modern systems. He joins the likes of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kao-kangaroo-2022">Kao the Kangaroo</a></em>,&nbsp;<em>Glover</em>, and, of course,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time">Crash Bandicoot</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy"><em>Spyro the Dragon</em></a>, although those revivals are a little further back.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date or a list of platforms for the remaster of&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>yet, but Argonaut has said it's coming to "all the current consoles and PC" later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Every now and then I reflect on the statistically determined average age of a Gamer – what is it now, 36, 37? Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 
</p>
<p>
I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/run-from-mummies">Run From Mummies</a> - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

Run From Mummies is a game about archaeology in much the same way that Whack-A-Mole is a game about moles. You and up to three friends are tourists trapped in a giant pyramid filled with rambling undead, spike traps and laser-beam statue bosses. Your only weapon is a camera – you can stun the inhospitable relics and mess with other objects using the flash, in what is probably a serviceable metaphor for the effects of tourism on archaeological sites generally. Snapping a picture means standing still while an AOE triangle extends from your feet, however, so try not to do it whilst running away from a rolling boulder.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503180/Run_From_Mummies/">There’s a demo for Run From Mummies on Steam</a>. The full game spans seven regions linked by hand-drawn cutscenes that have reasonable Two Point energy. There are apparently “secrets” and “lore” to uncover, but while I can get behind probing layouts for sliding walls, I’m not sure plumping the codex is the point of a game like this. It reminds me a bit of Sega Dreamcast classic Power Stone, except that it’s top-down and 2D. Undoubtedly, half the fun will be getting in each others’ way.
</p>
<p>
Too cartoonish for your tastes? I can only assume you have older children between the ages of ten and twenty, “teen-agers” if you will, who think 2D is way uncool, ma. Perhaps they’ll be happier with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-both-a-more-relaxed-wolfenstein-and-riddick-plus-nazis">the new Indiana Jones game</a>. It’s fully 3D, boasting the finest polygons Microsoft's money can excavate from all the programmer brains they've got stowed in the cellar. It also has a photography mechanic where the point is actually to take photos of stuff, rather than giving hangry skeletons a seizure. Bit off-the-wall, but let's see where it goes.

<p>During a new interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Eurogamer</a>, Final Fantasy 14 director and producer Naoki Yoshida offered new comments about the latest Xbox release and plans for future titles.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who fans may recognize as Yoshi-P, revealed that “we’ve seen a really strong response on Xbox” following Final Fantasy 14’s release on the platform.</p>



<p>They also mentioned that Phil Spencer “put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality.” So, Yoshida says that “we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Yoshida said they consider Final Fantasy 14 to be just the starting point. They concluded that “we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox.”</p>



<p>Yoshida also addressed the Xbox market in Japan, as a general argument. They explained that “in the Japanese market there is an extremely low number of users on Xbox.” They added that developers in any country may want to focus on appealing to fans in their own country.</p>



<p>Last June, Yoshida also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied recent rumors</a> that they have any involvement in a Final Fantasy 9 remake. </p>



<p>Most recently, fans of the Final Fantasy series learned this week that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-releases-for-pc-this-september-demo-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16 is coming to PC</a> via Steam and EGS in September 2024. </p>

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that the MMO Blue Protocol will be ending service in Japan, and that the international release via Amazon Games has been canceled.</p><p>Blue Protocol will be shut down on January 18, 2025 in Japan. "As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games," Bandai Namco said in a <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world."</p><p>Bandai also added that while it been preparing for the game's launch, it ultimately concluded that it would be difficult to provide a satisfactory experience. Blue Protocol was supposed to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anime-mmorpg-blue-protocol-will-release-in-2023/1100-6509907/" data-ref-id="1100-6509907">worldwide simultaneously in 2023</a>, but only the Japanese version launched. The Western version, to be published by Amazon Games, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1660998805053906945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1660998805053906945%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was delayed to 2024</a>. Earlier this year, Bandai reported a <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1757894569059066137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1757894569059066137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">21 billion yen loss due to an underperforming game</a>, which may have been Blue Protocol.</p><p>Amazon Games has been synonymous with the MMORPG genre as of late, with games such as Lost Ark and New World. It's also publishing another MMO, the Korean-developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/being-a-free-player-in-amazons-new-mmo-wont-be-quite-so-rough-thanks-to-new-changes/1100-6525061/" data-ref-id="1100-6525061">Throne and Liberty</a>, next month. Amazon Games is also working on a Lord of the Rings MMO, for which its still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-lotr-mmo/1100-6526064/" data-ref-id="1100-6526064">find a gameplay hook</a>.</p>

The longtime Ubisoft voice actor and motion capture performer is now the voice and face of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> protagonist Kay Vess. Not only is it her first lead role, it's a role that lets her recreate her childhood, playing with Star Wars toys, and imagining she was one of the characters up on the silver screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's had a lot of time to dream since then. But when push came to shove, what is it she wanted to bring to a role like this? Kay's personality and appearance were being cooked up by the rest of the team at Ubisoft. With such a high-stakes license on the line, was there room for her to explore the character and build on everyone else's work?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yep. As she told Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, her time with Kay Vess saw the character shift from snarky and confident to someone who's more of a "dreamer"—honing what would make for a compelling lead for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="González saw much of herself in Kay's journey">González saw much of herself in Kay's journey</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to González, Kay originally was written as more "cynical" and more "jokey" before she came in, describing a character that sounds like Nathan Drake and his many quippy peers in the land of video game protagonists. "When they got me in the role, they noticed that I brought a bit more heart and vulnerability and because she is a rookie scoundrel," she recalled.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/take-a-look-at-nix-s-motion-capture-puppet-from-star-wars-outlaws" target="_self">Take a look at Nix's motion capture puppet from Star Wars Outlaws</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's made a lot of hay about how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fulfills the "scoundrel" Star Wars fantasy—a role tailored for the fans who connected more with the Han Solos of the series than the various Jedi protagonists. Luke Skywalker, Anakin, and Rey were all chosen heroes, but Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and other supporting characters embodied a sense of freedom, adventure, and loose obligation to morality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's a different type of story here in comparison to Lando Calrissian or Han Solo," González said. "They have the expertise, they're confident, they have the swagger...they're almost too confident."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kay, by contrast, is living through what you might say is her first day on the job. The game begins with her trying to score enough cash to leave the casino city of Canto Bight, and her adventure embodies a "fake it until you make it" attitude.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González said that direction let her bring "more of herself" to the performance. "I know what it means to put on a mask, and pretend like I know what I'm doing, and use my charm—Kay Vess has a lot of that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, González brought back a little bit of the Luke, Anakin, and Rey energy—characters whose stories all began with them dreaming of getting out and seeing a bigger world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"She's a dreamer," González said affectionately.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The motion capture team worked 8 hour days to preserve actor's energy">The motion capture team worked 8 hour days to preserve actor's energy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because this was González's first lead role, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gave her the most amount of work she'd had on an Ubisoft production. Good for her paycheck—but also demanding on the body. She explained how Ubisoft's motion capture process was designed to give actors time to rehearse and rest to make it through months of filming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The wonderful thing about motion capture, in comparison to TV and film, is that it's a very balanced lifestyle," she said. "We work nine to five, we always get our evenings off...which means that you do get a lot of rest."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team would rehearse a week's worth of performances on Monday, then spend Tuesday through Thursday shooting scene after scene. "The scenes take maybe a little longer, and when you shoot them, they're a bit more linear like in theater because we're not cutting in between [takes]. Because it's all mocap, and there's no sets or hair or makeup or costumes, you focus on the work a lot more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vess said as a motion capture performer, she's used to acting against "nothing," and quizzing directors for information on what will be onscreen in the final game. But getting to work with Camille Loiselle-D'Aragon and her </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/take-a-look-at-nix-s-motion-capture-puppet-from-star-wars-outlaws?cache=false">handmade Nix puppet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a particular delight. "That was a special moment," she said, recalling how Loiselle-D'Aragon would maneuver the puppet into jumping on her lap and other "visceral" interactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That was a very special moment," she recalled, "because I know that we don't often get that as motion capture performers."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="González and other performers face new kinds of threats.">González and other performers face new kinds of threats.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González, a Candian actor, isn't a member of SAG-AFTRA and thus isn't part of the ongoing strike against developers for their alleged refusal to bargain with actors on protections against exploitative use of generative AI. But she supports her peers, including actors like Dee Bradley Baker (who voices Nix and Jabba the Hutt in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "Voice actors can play so many roles in one game," she said, nodding to his multiple performances. "If they're only saying, 'we'll protect your likeness,' that doesn't really work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González has had to grapple with another challenge facing video game actors today: the threat of online harassment. In her case, it's largely manifested as part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820">a racist and sexist backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is the first Ubisoft open-world game in recent history to not let players select a player character from one of two genders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's not particularly concerned with the backlash (echoing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says-swedish-pride-in-craftsmanship-was-key-to-development-progress">comments made</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by creative director Julian Gerighty in our conversation with him at Gamescom), telling Game Developer that she does "zero engagement" with players who have nothing "constructive" to say, preferring to interact with fans like those she'd come to Gamescom to meet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She did say however, that the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">persistence</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of said campaigns shows why representing characters like her is important. "Having someone like me, who's an immigrant, who's queer, who's a Latina, who's a female protagonist in one of the biggest franchises in the world...I understand people are protective of those worlds, but we need to have representations of what [our] world actually looks like," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kay Vess may be a dreamer setting her way out in the galaxy, but it's clear González is ready for whatever the game industry throws at her.

            <p>If you are looking to get a bite sized portion of narrative-driven horror into your evening, you can now give The Casting of Frank Stone a quick whirl thanks to its free demo.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is the upcoming interactive game set in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">collaborative effort between slasher aficionados Supermassive Games and Behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>Its demo acts as a prologue to the main game itself, and plops players down at the Cedar Hills Steel Mill. Taking on the role of Sam Green - who is described as a "determined" policeman - players will then start investigating the rather sad case of a missing child.</p>

<p>I had a go last night, and the demo probably took me around 25 minutes to complete. It gave me the chance to find hidden collectables, get an idea how the game's choice mechanic works and just generally enjoy the unsettling atmosphere as we head closer towards autumn and the spooky season. I will probably give it another shot later, and make some different choices to see how much I can change the overall outcome (which I will not spoil here).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223840/The_Casting_of_Frank_Stone/">try the demo out for yourself on Steam now</a>. Please note, even if you finish the demo, progression will not carry over to the full game on release.</p>
<p>As for when that is, The Casting of Frank Stone is set to launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next month, on 3rd September.</p>

		<p>Everyone has a game from their past that they’d love to see again. That classic of your childhood that brimmed with imagination, and which you played to death because you only had one game. Well, if Croc Legend of Gobbos was that game for you, it’s time to rejoice, as both it, and original developers Argonaut Games, are returning, bringing that wiggly-bummed crocodile to modern platforms later this year, greener and shinier than ever before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lxQ4m_g21I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation 1, and selling over 3 million units, it was also ported to the Sega Saturn (the console of kings) and PC. It’s easy to throw around the word ‘classic’, but Croc Legend of Gobbos stands resolutely amongst the most beloved platformers of the era, and especially for PlayStation owners, bereft of games like Mario 64 and Bank Kazooie, Croc Legend of Gobbos filled that space admirably.</p>
<p>The remastered release is going to feature enhanced HD graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and an authentic gameplay experience that will take gamers back to the golden age of 3D platforming. Beyond that, fans will also have access to the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long lost development assets including game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and more.</p>


<p>Unusually, alongside the remaster, the original developers are returning as well, after a 20 year hiatus. Argonaut Games were a huge part of the gaming scene of the 80s and 90s. Founded by gaming icon Jez San OBE, the team are known for bringing pioneering 3D technology to a 2D gaming world in the 1980s. Alongside Croc, the team are probably best known for the seminal original Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, as well as the Super FX chip that made its 3D visuals possible on the 16-bit console. The team went on to make some of the best-known licensed games of the era as well, with the awesome Alien Resurrection and Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and its sequel.</p>

<p>A developers union at Call of Duty studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-CA-349076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. </p>



<p>First reported by Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-partner-showcase-raven-activision-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a> newsletter, the union at Raven Software claims that its parent companies are bargaining in bad faith as well as taking part in “concerted activities” such as retaliation and discipline. There are also allegations of changes in the terms and conditions of employment without agreement of the union.</p>







<p>“After Microsoft’s acquisition of&nbsp;Activision Blizzard, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software,” CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. said to GameFile. “Unfortunately, that has not happened. We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labor Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority.”</p>



<p>Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have responded to Insider Gaming’s requests for comment. Microsoft, however, did tell Totilo that it is “committed to negotiating in good faith.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has filed a request to view the full complaint, and will provide details should the request be granted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-brilliant-evolution-of-persona-and-smt.965952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From each character’s magical awakening and all the RPG mechanics it opens, to the social sim elements that feed into how you interact with the world, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> is clearly adopting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona formula</a> – but it’s doing so for something seemingly bigger in scope from both a gameplay and storytelling perspective. After playing about five hours of Atlus’ upcoming RPG, it’s extremely apparent how it’s leveraging the strengths of its previous games to think outside the confines of traditional fantasy and create something wholly unique. And as much as I love Persona, it’s about damn time we’ve had a game of this style that goes beyond the classroom walls and halls of high school.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metaphor ReFantazio Preview - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>No matter which way you cut it, Metaphor is a politically charged story – not just in the concept of being the main character who is striving to win an election to be the next king. Having played the opening hours, it boldly establishes the social dynamics of its medieval fantasy setting, the Kingdom of Euchronia. The story opens up with the protagonist in a carriage with a group of wanderers getting ambushed by bandits, where he witnesses a red-haired elven girl slice down the bandits before he gets kicked off a cliff to fend for himself. It’s a grim, hostile world outside of the towns and city walls where outlaws and monsters always seeking prey. And even within its capital, its society rife with classism and discrimination shows that nowhere is truly safe. Metaphor makes this clear as soon as you reach the Royal Capital in the opening hours, showcasing how poverty, racism, and militarism dictate life across the kingdom.</p><p>The protagonist is an “elda,” a tribe (or race) that presents as regularly human – they’re a rare sight in Euchronia and are treated with disdain. The elven “roussainte” and horned “clemar” are more commonly accepted while the hedonistic cat-like “paripus” live on the fringes of society. The tribal dynamics set the tone for a story that seems to wield social injustice as a major theme. But the main character isn’t just any young elda; he’s best friends with the crown prince, who’s effectively in a coma after a violent coup attempt from years ago. This relationship is revealed early on, which begs the question of what the protagonist’s role and motivations really are as he becomes a serious candidate in the kingdom-wide election process.</p><p>Significant parts of this opening use beautiful anime-style cutscenes and I didn’t mind putting the controller down for long periods because these show an elevated level of production chops compared to Atlus’ previous games. That extends to its stunning aesthetic; Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p><p>However, I wasn’t <em>entirely </em>sold on Metaphor in the opening hours. It’s visually striking with a captivating setup, but it’s delivered in a fairly by-the-numbers sequence of events as it tries to build the foundation of a brand new setting. I started to see the vision once I got deeper into the preview demo, though. After signing up as a foot soldier in the army and getting sent off to a dangerous military operation, you’re paired with a clemar named Strohl, and your fairy companion Gallica reminds you that your mission is to meet with someone on the inside who has vital information for your true goal. Not much is explained at first, but as I got through the introductory dungeon, I saw more of Metaphor’s pieces fall into place. I began to see how corruption from within the kingdom exploits people who are used as political pawns. I forged an early bond with Strohl who’s a well-meaning noble willing to put his life on the line for what’s right. But I also questioned why all the bosses of this world are deranged amalgamations of humans with monikers that harken to our real world. So much of Metaphor remains a mystery, but I was quickly convinced that its world warrants a journey upwards of 80-plus hours. And one thing I was sure of was that it still has that badass edge expected from an Atlus RPG.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p></div><p>Just like in Persona, each party member in Metaphor has an adrenaline-induced awakening that opens them up to supernatural powers, literally ripping their hearts out to transform into beastly figures. In battle, they transform into what are called Archetypes when casting spells or using certain types of attacks – they work more like RPG classes job system than they do than the Pokemon-like personas or demons from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">Shin Megami Tensei</a>. And instead of the Velvet Room or World of Shadows where you build a roster for combat, Metaphor has what’s called Akademia (which serves a similar purpose) where you assign and customize Archetypes for each party member.</p><p>When the preview demo fast-forwarded to much further into the story, the Archetype mechanics opened up significantly. Every character can unlock and spec into any of the 40-or-so Archetypes – a few of which include the spell-focused Mage, the swift trickster of Thief, the more balanced Seeker, and the tank-like Warrior. While I didn’t get to experience how deep it goes, I saw the various branches of Archetypes which also hinted at how they’ll evolve over the course of the game. Each of these come with their own stats that dictate combat roles, but also come with specific elemental affinities and spells, so party composition is still a fundamental part of Metaphor much in the same vein as a Persona or SMT.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Metaphor’s turn-based RPG combat leans heavier into SMT with the press-turn system where you earn extra actions for each turn phase, as opposed to Persona’s one-more and baton pass system. Although the naming conventions for certain elemental abilities have changed (light, dark, and buff spells have not, by the way), the flow is very familiar since you’re still targeting enemy weaknesses to get through battles effectively. A new wrinkle, however, is how you cast multi-target spells – in Metaphor, Synthesis attacks consume two turn icons and combine the elemental powers of two characters in order to execute devastating specials, including multi-target spells. It made me think more strategically about when I should use these kinds of abilities, but it’s also a clever rework since I no longer have to dedicate a character’s limited action slots to these spell types.</p><p>Another smart way Metaphor rethinks the formula is in how you initiate combat. There’s a real-time action element where you attack enemies in the dungeon to gain a turn advantage and damage foes before jumping into the turn-based battles. It’s a bit more involved than stealthy ambushes in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a>, and instead of repeatedly churning through low-level enemies, you can reach a point where you just hack and slash through the fodder entirely. However, enemies fight back in the overworld so you have to approach them carefully and dodge their attacks, lest you yourself get ambushed and put at a severe disadvantage. While the action element isn’t intended to be in-depth and is more of a preface to the full battles, it improves pacing by having a more sensible flow between exploration and combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together.</p></div><p>When I jumped later into the story, I was able to explore the humble town of Martira and experience how the day-night cycle and calendar system work. Spending time to understand the cultures of the world and the different peoples who embody them to build bonds is a revamp of the Confidant/Social Link mechanics, and these feed into combat since they unlock new Archetypes and abilities. Taking part in certain activities boosts social stats to let you access new interactions or quests as well. There’s still a countdown of days until a major story event happens, requiring you to progress the main quest at the appropriate pace and make tough decisions about how you spend your limited time in each phase of the day – as is Persona tradition. But from a conceptual level, winning the hearts and minds of seemingly disparate peoples amid political turmoil while carrying out your own personal mission fits this gameplay framework incredibly well.</p><p>Time management isn’t just about how you spend parts of your day either. Going on expeditions for quests to far-off locations across the kingdom consumes multiple days, pushing you to plan ahead and think about what’s worth doing. During expeditions on your Gauntlet Runner (the ground-based ship that works like a mobile headquarters), you can access unique interactions with characters while in transit, so it’s not like you’re simply burning days off the calendar. I got to strengthen my bond with the former royal knight Hulkenberg better through her love for tabletop games, and I cooked with my guy Strohl to get know him better while making healing items. Sidequests themselves involve battling through curated dungeons and bosses, and also present supplementary story content you wouldn’t see from the main quest alone. Metaphor is said to be packed with so much side content that the development team claimed you won’t be able to complete it all in one playthrough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Playing five hours of Metaphor ReFantazio proved what I’d been thinking for years since I fell in love with Persona – that the series foundation could reach new heights if used in a different context. And the context here is a violent political fantasy drama. The daily structure and social sim mechanics built around a turn-based RPG are so familiar but have been revamped in several small yet impactful ways, and it’s shaping up to be a brilliant, synergistic way of exploring an entirely new and fascinating fiction in the comfort of a framework I already know and love.</p><p>Aside from the bold new soundtrack from longtime Atlus composer Shoji Meguro (who’s now wielding classical orchestras and a Latin-style choir), Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together. A preview demo of a lengthy RPG isn’t going to reveal that, of course, but it’s showing promise with characters who make great first impressions, narrative themes that are clearly inspired by the problems we face in our real world, and a signature style full of powerful imagery. </p><p>I was also left with questions I’m eager to seek the answers to. There's this book that the protagonist is always carrying with him, and it contains a story of a utopia where everyone has happy and prosperous lives with images vaguely representing our reality. And the very first thing you do in Metaphor is name <em>yourself</em> before naming the protagonist. Given the crueIty displayed and the statements it makes early on, I can't stop thinking about what Metaphor will ultimately say about virtues and perils of the human condition. It won’t be long until we get those answers because Metaphor ReFantazio launches on October 11 this year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-preview.965949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since I pitted my brand new Bulbasaur against my rival’s Charmander in the opening chapter of Pokémon Red, I’ve loved turn-based combat. But I know this style of battle isn’t for everyone. Plenty have skipped over the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3, Persona 5, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns because of the slower, more managerial-like pace of turn-based combat. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wants to provide the solution to those issues. The upcoming RPG has plenty of smart ideas that aim to evolve turn-based battles, transforming them from baton-passing attack sequences to thrilling, skill-based conflicts. </p><p>I recently met with developer Sandfall Interactive to watch creative director Guillaume Broche play through just under an hour of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. While clearly inspired by Japanese RPG titans like Final Fantasy, Clair Obscur feels distinctly European. Rather than sporting outrageous anime hair and a sword larger than the Empire State Building, protagonist Gustave is a handsomely dressed gent with a face that could be almost mistaken for Robert Pattinson’s. During my demo, he and the equally elegant mage Lune explored the ocean floor-like Flying Waters region, picking through the remains of prior expeditions that had been scattered among the coral. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Gustave and Lune are the latest team attempting to defy the will of the Paintress, a god-like figure who kills scores of people each year by painting a number on a monolith. Anyone of that age instantly fades away, Infinity War style. The demo’s short hour duration didn’t allow for much insight into this story, but what was obvious was the dark and melancholic tone. It seems somewhat literary in a manner I found very appealing, rooted in its character's emotions and fears. </p><p>Gustave was soon reunited with his foster sister, Maelle, who’d been lost in a manor that lies beyond the boundaries of time and space. Together with Lune, the trio formed a full party, which brings us to those aforementioned evolutionary ideas for turn-based combat. Broche tells me that he was inspired by Sekiro’s parry system to implement skill-based elements into the genre’s traditional tactical framework. The result is quick time event-augmented turns, with reflex and timing-based actions required in both the attack and defend phases. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow.</p></div><p>Clair Obscur isn’t the first turn-based RPG to use QTEs in combat, but it’s the first I’ve seen that seems to put equal emphasis on both the action and tactical aspects. Every attack demands some kind of input, be that reflex-testing button prompts or manually aiming a weapon at targets. More complex attacks chain together QTEs, providing a better sense of kinetic energy in each phase of the fight. </p><p>But it’s when your characters are on the defensive that Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow, and perfect deflects trigger powerful counter-attacks. Gone are the days of just watching a boss unleash hell on your party – here you can actively avoid and punish damage. Broche tells me that you can even do a no-hit run of the entire game, right up to and including the final battle. </p><p>Alongside these pacier ideas are more traditional staples. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 uses a menu-driven interface that looks like Persona 5’s UI as translated by Dishonored. Each move requires a character to spend from their pool of action points, which gradually increases as the turns tick by (an idea inspired by card game mana systems). Parries refund one action point, so there’s an incentive to try and nail that parry window – the better you defend yourself, the better attacks you can unleash on the next turn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Each character’s ability set is unique to them, which hopefully makes them feel like significant individuals both in and out of combat. Spearheading their kits are special skills with bespoke mechanics; Lune is able to ‘stain’ enemies with her spells and then later consume those stains to inflict big damage, while Maelle is able to switch through a variety of stat-altering stances depending on which attacks she uses. </p><p>Sandfall Interactive also promises a deep progression system for each party member. Each level attained allows you to upgrade each character’s stats Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style, as well as choose a new ability from a skill tree. On top of that are Pictos, trinkets that provide tactic-shifting passive skills (such as parries granting an extra action point), plus the unique properties of the weapons each party member wields. Broche tells me that combining and upgrading these elements in the right way can unlock wild and destructive synergies. I hope this character build system, combined with the developer-crafted ability kits, allows players to put together fascinating, tactics-driven parties akin to the way that card game players hone a deck to a particular strategy.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline.</p></div><p>Due to the somewhat contextless nature of the demo, much of what I saw outside of combat was harder to judge. What I did take away was the sense that this is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline; like Square’s JRPGs of old, Clair Obscur is not open world, opting instead for linear regions complete with save point-like resting spots. Sandfall promises these regions have been built to be expansive enough to allow off-the-beaten-path adventures, though, including optional bosses. At this stage, I can’t say how strong Clair Obscur’s exploration chops are, but what I saw ranged from the relatively mundane (shoot three symbols to unlock loot) to the ethereal (a child NPC peeling away into the ether like an ancient painting) to the genuinely funny (a sentient, French-speaking paintbrush called Noco, who will sell you his best wares provided you fight his gigantic boss form). </p><p>While I’ve yet to form any significant opinions on its wider gameplay ideas, I can say that I really liked what I saw of Clair Obscur’s world. It has concepts and characters I’m looking forward to delving into, strong voice acting, and a genuinely gorgeous graphical style. But the thing I’m really excited about is the smarts-skills-smarts loop the fights seem to thrive on. A cerebral moment of lining up a clever attack is followed by a speedy burst of rhythmic button taps, a perfectly-judged parry, and then it’s back to quietly contemplating exactly what attack will rupture your foe’s defences. Staunchly traditional turn-based fans may consider this up-and-down tempo a bit too jarring – tactical combat for the short-attention-span generation. But from my perspective at least, this is the fresh approach the system has needed for some time. I hope, when I finally get to play Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 myself, it proves itself to be a more involving turn-based experience as opposed to a system that simply makes concessions to the action-loving crowd.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The one other caveat is that the main character of the first Suikoden game can't hold both orbs at the same time. The more you know.</p><h2>What is Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster?</h2><p>The first Suikoden game released in Japan on the original PlayStation in 1995, with the sequel coming out in 1998 on the same platform. The games made it to the West a year after their Japanese release. Each game in the series focuses on having you recruit 108 warriors to fight by your side. So your job is to build up an army and fight the forces of evil.</p><p>Some remasters have completely overhauled graphics, which runs the risk of losing the charm of the original. That does not appear to be the case here. The original pixelated graphics are pretty intact, but now they fill modern wide-screen displays. They've also redone some of the spell effects to look better and more smooth, and redrawn the character portraits in HD.</p><p>In addition to the improved graphics, you now have the ability to speed up battles, or turn on an auto-battle mode. The game also has auto-save and a conversation log, in case you accidentally tap a button to progress the conversation before reading it (this happens to me all the time in RPGs). It also has a revamped UI, making things like changing equipment easier.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Suikoden I&amp;II Nintendo Direct August 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-preorder-guide">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-switch-ps4">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Here is an overview of the remastered release, via Argonaut Games:</p><blockquote><p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em>, Argonaut’s 1997 multi-million-selling hit, features Croc, a lovable crocodile who embarks on a quest to rescue the Gobbos from the clutches of the evil Baron Dante. The game’s charm and creativity made it an instant classic, and the remaster promises to bring the beloved game to a new generation of gamers with enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience that will be sure to ignite the imagination of players and remind them why they fell in love with video games in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, retro-gaming fans will be excited to learn that the remaster includes the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_909909"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“I worked closely with Jez on the design and production of <em>Starglider</em>, Argonaut’s first big hit back in 1986, so to take up the mantle of relaunching Argonaut Games nearly four decades later brings me full circle, and we have further exciting announcements in the pipeline in the coming months,” said Argonaut Games co-CEO Gary Sheinwald in a press release.</p><p>Argonaut Games co-CEO Mike Arkin added, “We wanted to honor the original game’s legacy while introducing it to a new audience. The HD remaster allows us to do just that. It’s been a labor of love for our team, and we can’t wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.”</p><p>Original Argonaut Games founder Jez San said, “I’m thrilled to see the Argonaut name back after 20 years away. Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming, and I’m excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy, starting with the <em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster.”</p><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer for <em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> below.

<p>In a new loosely translated <a href="https://x.com/ryugagotoku/status/1828767174678507927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that it will host another anticipated RGG Summit in September 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>







<p>Fans can already tune in to wait for the event via YouTube Premiere, but the YouTube video description doesn’t elaborate on anything.</p>



<p>Instead, it broadly reiterates there will be updates about Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio itself. So, there are currently no concrete details on the potential Like a Dragon games the devs could feature in the next RGG 2024 summit. </p>

		<p>There’s no doubt about it, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the best looking games that’s expected to release next year. Built in Unreal Engine 5, it’s got the technical backing and prowess that this offers, but this would be nothing without the arresting art direction and the world that Sandfall Interactive is creating for their RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDyqGZy78Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a deep and mournful sadness to the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a resignation to the inevitability of the fate of its people to simply disappear into nothingness one year at a time. That’s all thanks to the Paintress, who wakes up once a year, paints a number on a monolith and curses all the people of that age to turn into ashes and simply fade away. There’s echoes of Logan’s Run, but it’s steeped in an even greater tragedy as that number drops down and down and down.</p>


<p>What purpose the Paintress has in doing this, it’s far from clear right now, but just as she paints a number each time, an expedition is sent out each time to battle through a mysterious continent and try to stop her… or at least beat a path for those who will follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>The visual style of this game is inspired by Belle Époque France, a period of 40-odd years that saw art leap from Impressionism through post-Impressionist movements, to Art Nouveau and beyond. I get the feeling that (while it precedes this specific time period by a couple years), Jules Vergne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas might have also provided some inspiration, not least because the gameplay demonstration saw our Expeditioners trying to reunite underwater and encountering… well, lots of strange stuff.</p>


<p>Despite very clearly being underwater, Expedition 33 don’t need to don diving suits and air tanks in order to survive, nor are they beholden to the buoyant physics of moving around at the bottom of the sea. As Gustave and Lune explore this strange environment, trying to find trace of their other companions, they will happen upon previous expeditions –&nbsp;in this demo it was Expedition 68, who you’ll then have the opportunity to learn more about and the trials that they faced.</p>
<p>That’s obviously rather ominous, and feeds into the hopeless-feeling endeavour, but so is where Gustave and Lune manage to find Maelle: a strange mansion where she’s being kept at the pleasure of a deeply unsettling being, the Curator. Thankfully they seem to be some kind of ally, helping to focus Maelle’s abilities and pushing her to train in combat.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur leans on tried and true forms for turn-based RPG combat, but throws in a few unique twists and combines ideas in an invigorating fashion. This is a turn-based affair, with the order of characters displayed clearly on the left side of the screen, while the menu of options fans out from your character in a manner that feels reminiscent of the Persona series. However, once you choose which attack to unleash, you’re greeted with an active QTE component that fans of Mario’s set of RPGs will be familiar with, timing a button press to ramp up the power of your attack or bolstering an ability, and when enemy attacks are incoming, dodging or potentially countering them right back –&nbsp;a high risk option as you need to block all incoming attacks in order to counter.</p>

<p>This is all rendered in Clair Obscur’s lavish style, with a particularly dynamic camera following sweeping animations, slow-mo and swirling effects to give each attack, ability and counter an artistic flair that looks simply awesome.</p>
<p>That would potentially be compelling enough, but Clair Obscur adds a few additional ideas into the mix as well. Ranged attacks can be free-aimed, letting you try to pinpoint an enemy weakness – or in the case of a boss battle, targeting the flowers that it spawns in a light puzzle mechanic – and each character has their own particular tweaks to factor. Lune’s role as a mage allows her to build up Stains that can then be spend to add damage to attacks later in the battle, while Maelle has different stances.</p>

<p>This was just a fairly brief glimpse at what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 offers, the time available not able to show off the game’s more open zones, for example. However, it’s safe to say that this is a game than any turn-based RPG fan should be keeping an eye on. It looks stunning, the cause is utterly futile and hopeless, and the battle mechanics pick and choose ideas to weave together an engaging looking brand of combat. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

		<p>A mouthful in all senses, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Travel Beyond Fantasy | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_-BPELOl0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My word, does it looks good! From the fully animated cutscenes, via the imaginative character and creature designs, the anime-esque gameplay envelops you in a fantasy world that’s totally its own.</p>


<p>Our playthrough starts with a murder. The king, already seemingly on his deathbed, has a blade plunged into his body, potentially sending the kingdom spinning off into chaos, as his only heir had recently died himself. There’s foul play afoot and Louis, a behorned knight, is at the centre of it.</p>
<p>You take on the role of a young Elda boy, whose origin in the story starts by being kicked off a cliff. Accompanied by the fairy Gallica, a slightly more combative Tinkerbell, you’re on a vital mission to infiltrate the royal guard, though that’s as far as your knowledge goes at this point. Perhaps it was the fall off a cliff.</p>

<p>As well as being our companion, the opening of our demo sees Gallica cast our character’s favourite spell, which suddenly brings the world to life with music. I love the idea that the soundtrack has been cast on our character rather than just accepting that every event is just accompanied by music. The vocal-led, high tempo track certainly makes things more dramatic, and throughout our hour with the game it’s often stunning.</p>

<p>Eight tribes and three nations make up the United Kingdom of Euchronia. As you’d expect, the city is more diverse than our characters have encountered out in the sticks, though it’s mainly two tribes – the Clemar and the Roussante – that you’ll see.</p>
<p>There’s some racial undertones at play within the fantasy setting, and as an Elda you’re looked down on by pretty much everyone else. Gallica speaks out against the prejudice, and here’s hoping that people become more accepting as you progress. It’ll be interesting to see whether the Studio Zero team use this opportunity for social commentary, or whether it’s purely a narrative tool.</p>
<p>You’re on the way to the Grand Cathedral, an inverted pyramid looming out of the desert. Despite the sandy setting, it’s a very British city that you’re visiting, with the localised language options using local accents to bed things in further, and Georgian-styled streets filled with people.</p>
<p>As you wander around you can listen in on all the gossip of the city-folk, with ‘PSST’ signs showing that you’re not really supposed to be listening in. It’s fun though, and gives the world some real grounding as the people talk in hushed tones about the assassination and how the country is going to hell. It’s so stereotypically British that you even get to join a queue. ‘Press A to join a queue’, might just be this winter’s favourite meme.</p>

<p>There were so many cutscenes in our hands-on that it feels as though this is a TV series that you’re occasionally playing, though I’m sure that balance is going to be a lot more gameplay-heavy across the finished game. What is does prove is how involved the storytelling is, and the production values are truly stunning. After an hour in this world I’m already fully invested in seeing where this tale goes.</p>
<p>Leon Strohl is your first companion, and it’s in his company that you first experience true battle. It’s here that it becomes clear who the monsters in this world are: they’re humans, though not exactly as you or I would know them. In fact, the first ‘human’ looks more like a dinosaur escaping from an egg, with vaguely human legs. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>You can start Squad Battles here, with turn-based combat playing out as you’d expect. You can choose to attack, defend, or utilise skills or items, gaining experience when the enemy is vanquished. You can surprise enemies by catching them unawares with a swipe of your sword, letting you enter combat with an unanswered attack and an initial stun which makes chopping them into bits a little bit easier.</p>

<p>During our hands-on this was the most straightforward aspect of Metaphor: ReFantazio, but the reassuring combat should allow the more unusual world and narrative room to breathe.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio was one of Gamescom 2024’s highlights, and a game to keep an eye on as we hurtle toward its <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">October release</a>. Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.</p>

			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a game that has been in the works for a very long time. Announced back in 2016 as Project Re: Fantasy, the first game by Studio Zero, a new ATLUS internal development studio headed by Persona 3, 4, and 5 director Katsura Hasino, the game only resurfaced <a href="https://wccftech.com/personas-team-fantasy-rpg-metaphor-re-fantazio-announced-for-a-2024-release/">last year</a> with a trailer that provided the first look at the project deeply rooted in traditional fantasy aesthetics. Even with a different setting, however, the Persona series DNA is still quite prevalent in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but that is not a bad thing at all, as I feel the game will be the first real step forward for the formula in a very long time.</p>
<p>During last week's Gamescom, I had the chance to play through the first hour of Metaphor: ReFantazio. Right from the beginning, I was hooked. The United Kingdom of Euchronia, the assassination of its king, and the main character's mission, which involves lifting the curse placed on the crown prince, was engaging from the start, as was the little world-building I experienced. The game's world seems to be rather complex, featuring multiple tribes with tense relationships among one another, which I expect to play a rather big part in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as everyone Persona fan knows, one hour of gameplay is too little to evaluate a massive game like Metaphor: ReFantazio, but I definitely appreciated how the adventure doesn't waste too much getting the main character and his fairy companion Gallica into the thick of things. As such, I was able to experience some short exploration sequences on the field surrounding the city of Grand Trad, and I couldn't help but notice how much better roaming around is compared to the latest Persona games. Fields, for example, are vast and filled with enemies and treasure, while cities are rendered in the proper scale that represents their grandeur rather nicely. Interaction with the environment and other NPCs was standard fare for JRPGs, but at least Metaphor: ReFantazio seems to do its best to properly represent the vastness of its world.</p>

<p>In my hour with the game, I was also able to test out the game's combat system and explore one dungeon, the Northern Bord Fort, which honestly felt very straightforward and not particularly remarkable. Metaphor: ReFantazio employs the Turn Press combat system, which allows both player and enemy to obtain extra turns when hitting weaknesses, but with a new twist that gives players an advantage if they stun the enemy before entering combat by attacking them on the field. This is a great addition that does wonders for the game's pacing, even though this iteration of the Press Turn system is pretty snappy to begin with. For the rest, battles play the same as in the latest Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games: find an enemy's weakness, exploit it, and win the battle while avoiding getting one's own weaknesses exploited. I was unable to test out the Archetype system, unfortunately, as my time with the demo ended before it was properly introduced, and exactly when another feature from the Persona series got introduced: a time limit for main quests.</p>
<p>Evaluating a massive role-playing game like Metaphor: ReFantazio in just one hour is impossible, but my time with it during Gamescom definitely left me hungering for more. For the first time in a very long time, the formula of the Persona series is getting a much-needed shake-up, and I am very interested to see if the game will end up being something more than just Persona in a fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
