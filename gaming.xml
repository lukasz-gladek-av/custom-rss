            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-toem-2-hands-on-back-behind-the-lens/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With its first gameplay reveal during this year's Day of the Devs, indie developer Something We Made finally showed off the sequel to their inaugural title TOEM: A Photo Adventure from 2021. This charming photography adventure brought an easygoing monochrome adventure to hundreds of fans and left us wanting more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>TOEM 2 opens with the same plucky character from the first title dropped into the world with little more than ambition and a trusty camera. While the first game focused on ascending the TOEM mountain, I didn't catch nary a whiff of the actual motivations and reasoning for the journey this time around. Instead, I was given free reign to meander around the idyllic village and solve a variety of problems for the townsfolk, from trying to retrieve a potion of liquid courage for a scaredy-cat knight to taking photos of three goats in order to permit a bridge troll to let me pass. In my twenty or so minutes of play, I was able to help solve the small-scale problems of four individuals and be rewarded with a stamp for my collection each time.</p>
<p>The camera remains the player's best tool in the world of TOEM 2 with players not only able to use their photography skills to solve the plights of the ordinary person, but also a variety of attachments to use as tools in your adventure. The very first unlockable upgrade I earned for my camera was a hammer upgrade that let me smash through select stone blocks that hindered my progression. Using the hammer is just like the other attachments from the first TOEM: simply point and shoot (or in this case, tap on the rocks). It took a moment to realize that there's a small minigame to using the hammer with players having to tap out morse code with short and long taps in order to break those rocks.</p>
<figure>

<p>One puzzle I encountered was take a 3x3 cube of blocks and chisel away to make a matching sculpture to the quest giver. Rather than trying to memorize the layout or run back and forth between the source sculpture and what I was crafting, I stopped to take photos of each side of the cube and use those to remember the requested shape. The developers from Something We Made seemed surprised that this was a valid solution to their puzzle and it was nice to see the camera being used as a note taking device as well as the tool you'll use to take pictures of every animal around the landscape.</p>
<p>New to TOEM 2 is also the addition of jumping, and in true platformer style, I had to test it out by jumping around on top of any short wall I could find and try to scale up the world. I couldn't find any unintended out-of-bounds areas, but I was at least able to find some climbable areas that would lead to new hats for the playable character. With jumping now on the menu, I wouldn't be surprised if the Honk attachment gets phased out for TOEM 2.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's still a fair bit of time before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/">TOEM 2</a> is ready to be in players' hands. Developer Something We Made and publisher popagenda have penciled in this quaint photographical adventure for 2026 across a slew of unannounced consoles as well as PC.</p>

            <p>
I don't think you can more easily sell me on a game than by saying it was made by one of the artists behind Celeste, and has music from Disasterpeace, i.e. the composer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, and It Follows. But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a> is, a horror RPG in the vein of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/neverway-is-a-horror-rpg-stardew-valley-from-one-of-the-artists-behind-celeste">first announced back in April</a>, back with a nice little look-in at yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pedro Medeiros, the Celeste artist in question, and programmer/ writer Isadora Sophia gave a great little rundown of Neverway, explaining that you play as Fiona, a character who much like the player character in Stardew has just quit her dead end job. She's trying to start over on a farm, live the quiet life, except she ends up having to serve as a herald for a dead god because of some debt she owes. Awkward!

<p>
That kind of life does end up leading towards the need to fight in a classic Zelda-ish 2D action combat kind of way, but you do have to balance all of that adventuring with your regular life too. That means farming, paying your mortgage, making friends, maybe even falling in love. Those bonds can lead to new combat abilities too, something I wish my own relationships offered me. 
</p>
<p>
Time works a bit differently in Neverway too, as rather than the day slowly tick tocking away, it moves from morning, to afternoon, to night when you do things like eat, sleep, or read a manual of some sort.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you'll end up searching for the titular Neverway, a "decaying nightmarish reality that is slowly leaking into yours." This is where you'll learn about the game's post-apocalyptic world as you pay off your debt.
</p>
<p>
I know "farming sim but dark" isn't exactly a new concept, it's just that Neverway is doing so with such eyecatching style I can't help but be won over by it. It looks like there's a real sincerity to the life-sim elements as opposed to them just being slapped into some dark themes. That's the ticket to my heart honestly, a good bit of earnestness goes a long way.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just wrapped up its latest explosive live event, detonating the Death Star looming over the Island and welcoming DC Comics hero Superman in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's event, Death Star Sabotage, saw nearly 6 million players infiltrate the Empire's fully operational battle station that has hovered menacingly over the Fortnite battle royale Island throughout its Star Wars mini-season. Happily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, players were able to stop the station's deadly space laser from obliterating the game's map — although not without causing a bit of damage in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As destruction rained down, the event's closing moments saw Superman arrive — presumably to try and help with clean up duties during the game's incoming superhero-themed season, which begins in just a few hours' time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's big Star Wars event began in orbit around the game's battle royale Island, giving players a rare glimpse at the game's setting from outside its usual boundaries. Fortnite's setting exists as a bubble of reality floating through the multiverse (which handily allows any character from any franchise to turn up at any time!) and here, players were able to pilot X-Wings and TIE-Fighters to blow up orbiting Star Destroyers and engage in fun dogfights. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">continued absence of a Star Wars: Battlefront 3</a>, this was a fun riff on its space battles to get things started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action then swiftly moved to within the Death Star itself, as Fortnite heroes Jonesy (Troy Baker) and Hope (Suzie Yeung) led players through the bowels of the station, initially disguised as Stormtroopers and their captives. Ultimately, players found themselves in an encounter with Star Wars' Emperor (was that the voice of Sheev Palpatine himself, Ian McDiarmid?), and able to escape the Death Star as it exploded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/0defa510-26bf-45aa-835e-6c50e905e524-1-1749324031249.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Battlefront eat your heart out.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a nod to Fortnite's 2021 live event Operation Sky Fire (which also ended in a space station exploding above the game's Island), players were initially left to celebrate their victory — until the realisation that huge flaming chunks of said space station were now raining down on their battle royale home. And here, one of these chunks smashed straight into the glowing Rift Gate used to access the spirit realm by Fortnite's current antihero Daigo, unleashing its untold power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event's final moments see players back on the Island, mysterious energy now crackling around them. (Will this be the explanation for why superpowers now exist in the next battle royale season? Quite possibly.) Meanwhile, Superman is seen watching the Island from afar, as it is flooded by spirit realm energy. The suggestion here, of course, is that Superman will be swooping in to help.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/696-fortnite-death-star-sabotage-full-event-experience-00-14-22-1749324356071.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Superman watches as Fortnite's battle royale Island erupts in spirit realm energy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite will, for the first time, follow up a major live event with a new season launch on the same day. Following the conclusion of Death Star Sabotage, Fortnite is currently in downtime, but will return with Chapter 6: Season 3 in just a few hours' time. As you might expect from Superman's arrival, this next season will indeed be superhero themed — and as eagle-eyed players have noticed, this is indeed the new version played by David Corenswet from James Gunn's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> movie. That's some well-timed brand synergy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While highly anticiapated, Fortnite's Star Wars season saw some of the game's lowest player numbers in some time — perhaps in response to its daring decision to remove all regular weapons (and all ammo!) and fully commit to a five-week period of Star Wars gunplay. It will be interesting to see how player numbers rebound with the launch of this new season later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Fortnite developer Epic Games announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-darth-vader-was-the-beginning-epic-reveals-plans-to-let-people-create-their-own-ai-npcs-in-fortnite">making Star Wars in-game assets available to creators to build their own experiences in a galaxy far, far away</a> in the not too far off future. While enjoyable, tonight's live event did feel at some points like something of a showcase for that, while including a few morsels for fans of the game's ongoing narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to watch the whole of Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage for yourself? You can find a recording of the full live event mission below, or Epic Games has a 4K quality version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJ2z07dpoc&amp;ab_channel=Fortnite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite x Star Wars: Galactic Battle Death Star Sabotage Event <a href="https://t.co/3EeBvjVmpI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3EeBvjVmpI</a></p>— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931417911190491429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics.

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971806"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Owlcat Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</em> is a third-person action RPG set in <em>The Expanse</em> universe. You’re no hero—just a merc caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, trying to hold your crew together and keep the ship up and running. Your choices will shape your story.</p><p><strong>The Universe Never Told Us if We Did Right or Wrong</strong></p><p>By the 24th century, humanity has conquered the cosmos. However, life has remained anything but easy. In The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, a story-driven sci-fi Action RPG, you play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Create and customize your own captain—Earther, Martian, or Belter—and lead a crew of highly-skilled specialists as you face off against escalating threats, political pressure, and a relentless enemy that will stop at nothing to see you dead. In a solar system held together by fragile alliances, every decision leaves its mark.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971804"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Trust Isn’t Given—It’s Earned</strong></p><p>Your companions are more than just mission assets—they are people with their own scars and loyalties. Some chase redemption. Others hide their truths. Over time, your relationships will flourish or deteriorate depending on the choices you make and how you choose to lead. The ship becomes your home—a place where trust is earned, not given.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Third-Person Combat</strong></p><p>Fight in third-person utilizing cover-focused gunplay and abilities. Two companions will accompany you into the field while others will support from a distance: disabling systems or drawing the enemies’ attention. You will issue real-time commands and have to adapt quickly to survive the manifold threats the system will throw at you.</p><p><strong>The Fractured World of The Expanse</strong></p><p>Visit iconic locations like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. Walk through ruined habitats and political strongholds mired in unease and tension. Talk to the locals. Uncover secrets. Use your skills to influence what happens next. The system looks different from every planet and from every asteroid. Some are falling apart. Others just hide it better. You may even come across a familiar face or voice that reminds you of just how small the system really is.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/hands-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds-now-were-racing-with-portals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There was a time where many would have pointed to Sonic being the best kart racer around. With a pair of games in the early 2010s, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/04/02/weview-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed/">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a> had great circuits, a fun and eye-catching vehicle transformation system, and a huge roster drawn from more than just the Sonic universe. Those vehicle transformations are making a comeback in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and it’s easy to argue that Sonic’s erstwhile rival Mario actually cribbed from his homework, with Mario Kart now also having transforming vehicles and a quirkier line up of characters.</p>
<p>But where Mario’s just gone open world, Sonic’s now going inter-dimensional, or maybe intergalactic?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds –&nbsp;Now we're racing with portals!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tILNuCTkEKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the big hook for CrossWorlds. The karting will feel pretty immediately familiar, slotting right into the genre staple elements and tropes, while the tracks will bounce back and forth between driving on roads, powering across water, and flying through the air, but everything changes after the first lap. At that point, the race leader is able to choose between two portals, deciding which CrossWorlds stage you’ll be teleported to for the second of the three laps. Through a four race championship, the final round will be one lap each of the first three race tracks, teleporting you between them instantly.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, and the CrossWorlds are a potential wildcard that the leader can use to play to their own strengths, though when there’s 24 tracks and 15 CrossWorlds stages, they could quickly become the part of the game you know best, especially if players online start to gravitate towards a particular one or two.</p>


<p>This also puts another bit of pressure on for the light collectathon angle. Each track has got five red stars to collect, in amongst the long strings of rings, of course. It’s a bit like collecting letters or other pickups in a platformer, except that you’re also trying to win the race, and you really only have the first and third laps in order to grab them.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of other intriguing twists to the kart racing formula from Team Sonic. It starts at, well, at the start of the race, where the way you get a boost is much more like a sim racing game’s need to get the revs just right. That kind of approach can also be seen when drifting, where a drift bar fills up repeatedly to very clearly demonstrate how much of a boost you’ll get when you come out of it.</p>
<p>If those a shade of more realistic racers, then the air tricking is right out of the arcade extreme sports playbook. As you’re going through the air on a big jump, you can flick and flip your car around pulling over-the-top tricks to build up a boost… but make sure not to hit the ground again while tricking or all that effort will go to waste. This combined with the handling in general, not to mention that clear blue sky Sega aesthetic, really does make Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds feel like a classic arcade racer.</p>

<p>But you wouldn’t get something like the Gadget Plate at the arcades. You simply wouldn’t have time to make use of this degree of customisation before you run out of coins to feed the machine!</p>
<p>Dished out by the mustachio’d cat in a hover car, Dondon Pa, Gadget Plates let you equip a whole bunch of car-modifying Gadgets. A plate has got two rows of three slots which you can fill up how you see fit, with gadgets taking up a number of slots and then modifying everything from the vehicle speed and acceleration, to letting you carry three items, doubling boost, increasing the chances of particular item types, and making certain items more powerful.</p>
<p>If you expect to win on skill and speed, the vehicle mods would be the order of the day with a bump to defensive item odds, but someone that likes to race in the thick of it would get much more out of boosting attack item chances, a giant rocket punch mode, and a quicker recovery. You can set up multiple gadget loadouts and switch out the plates between races as well, which will let you switch up some of how you race.</p>

<p>There’s some neat ideas in Sonic Racing CrossWorlds that bring a real arcade feel to the genre in a way that maybe only Sonic could.</p>

                <p>Following the spectacular Death Star Sabotage season finale event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline for maintenance ahead of the launch of Chapter 6 Season 3. The Emperor has been defeated, the Empire has been run off the Fortnite island yet again, and after five short weeks of Star Wars mayhem, it's time for Fortnite to move on to its summer season, which has only just slightly been officially revealed--more on that in a moment.</p><p>Star Wars season was an unorthodox one for Epic Games, which had never dropped a season quite like this one before--past mini seasons were throwbacks, rather than full-throated collaboration events, though last year's Remix season blurred that line. But now that it's over, Fortnite is going back to a more standard season for the summer. And we won't have long to wait for it to get started.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start time</h2><p>Every previous time that a Fortnite season ended with a live event on a Saturday, the game went offline until at least Sunday morning. But this time, it seems as though Season 3 will instead be launching <em>tonight</em>.</p><p>Players who completed the Death Star Sabotage event were greeted with a timer counting down to the start of the new season--but it said it would start in less than six hours. The timer is counting down to 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on Saturday evening. That doesn't necessarily guarantee that it actually will be back online then, since maintenance downtime length can be unpredictable, but clearly that is what Epic Games is aiming for.</p><p>Given that, you can expect Fortnite to be back online <strong>sometime during the evening after 5 PM PT on Saturday.</strong></p><p>We've already gotten details on what to expect, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">what's new in Season 3</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6652/" data-ref-id="2900-6652">Season 3 battle pass</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6651/" data-ref-id="2900-6651">map changes</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-chapter-6-season-3-super-all-guns-hero-items-and-loot/2900-6650/" data-ref-id="2900-6650">new weapons</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At SGF this year, TechRaptor got a chance to check out the upcoming SGF demo for <em>Frosthaven</em>, a digital adaptation of 2022's hit strategy game. This faithful recreation of the board game presents a 'no mess' version of an incredible (and difficult) board game with deep legacy mechanics as you not only explore the world and develop your characters, but build up the settlement of <em>Frosthaven </em>to offer more gameplay opportunities and build up defences.</p>

<p>Before getting my hands on the game, I was lucky enough to not only speak with Hristo Petkov, the game director for <em>Frosthaven</em>, as well as Isaac Childres, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" rel="nofollow">designer behind the <em>Frosthaven </em>board game</a>.</p>

<h2>Adapting <em>Frosthaven </em>From The Board To The Screen</h2>

<p>Knowing that <em>Gloomhaven</em>, the previous game in the 'Haven' series, had already been adapted into a Video Game, I asked what it was like adding on additional elements to suit <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>In praise of Childres and the new mechanics that were created, he said, "Each character has a very individual playstyle and mechanics, so we needed to actually change quite a lot from Gloomhaven."</p>

<p>The largest addition that had to be created was the Outpost phase. This is the part of the game in between the combat missions where you can "create buildings, craft potions, and so on. You also need to defend it from attackers that approach the city."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=DSb1iGft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=niup-9WX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a legacy game, <em>Frosthaven </em>iterates from session to session as you and your friends develop their characters and build out the town. I was excited to hear that even if you're playing a game with friends, if one friend isn't able to make it, the game adapts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Let's say you have a four-person party and one of the guys cannot come today. You can still play with or without their character for a couple of missions, and he can come back after. It's not a problem, just like the board gam,e it's very adaptable in terms of the number of players."</p>

<p>It was highlighted that even in a scenario where one player ends up at a lower level than the rest of the players, then the game will adjust to the average level of the party.</p>

<p>I turned to Childres to ask if he'd considered a digital edition of <em>Frosthaven </em>while developing it, and he commented that he had only been focusing on making the board game. "Once it was made Twin Sales, who was the original publisher, approached us and asked, 'Do you want to do this one digital too?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?'"</p>

<p>Talking about the collaboration, I wanted to get a better idea of what it looked like as development continued and how it made sure to stay true to Childres' vision. Childres explained, "we have monthly meetings where they show me all the new assets and I'm like 'Oh, it looks awesome!'" while knowing he was easy to be pleased Childres also expressed appreciation that he gets to be so involved in the process.</p>

<p>Petkov also echo'd that sentiment "the approval process is very good, there are some things that we need to change, obviously, but generally speaking most things are approved first time."</p>

<h2>From Imagination To Screen</h2>

<p>Petkov did let me in on the idea that "the most challenging things, and the things that we had the most to talk about were things that didn't exist."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=X7a6hnxM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=gdE4Nlia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's easy to say or read that something is burning, but bringing it to life is something totally different.</figcaption></figure><p>He began to list off a variety of aspects of the game where there's a written description, but nothing visual. A Metallic Ruin to explore, a zombie blacksmith boss that just used a guard token, or a moving elevator that is represented on your dining room table.</p>

<p>In Board Games it's easy to substitute miniatures or describe an environment in text, but adapting that to a video game means you need to create assets for it all. Luckily for all of these places where there wasn't art the artists at Snapshot Games were excited to create these unique elements.</p>

<h2><em>Frosthaven </em>Steam Next Fest Demo</h2>

<p>From there I sat down with the Steam Next Fest Demo of the game, ready to get into the tutorial mission and explore <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>Starting the game I was brought to a party creation screen, selecting Bonechiller and Drifter, I could quickly review cards and abilities and purchase starting equipment. Asking how players had reacted to the Closed Beta that was held earlier it was the look of Bonechiller and Drifter that had actually received quite a bit of feedback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=Xd9-c7td 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=QhmACOBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updated feedback to these characters makes them more terrifying (and less ewok-y)</figcaption></figure><p>For Bonechiller, players though she should have more/deeper scars to reflect her tortured gameplay style, taking damage to summon creatures to fight for her. On the other hand, the Drifter was thought to have a face "too much like an Ewok".</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early Access Stats</strong><br>
When <em>Frosthaven </em>releases in Early Access there will be Six playable characters for you to play as and unlock. There will be 30 Scenarios from the Board Game made available, that means of the total 136 Scenarios approximately 22% of the game will be available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entering the first cutscene it was explained that the games events are fully voiced, this audio comes from the <em>Official Frosthaven Companion App</em>. By working together they were able to avoid reinventing the wheel and create a premium experience.</p>

<p>Loading into the first scenario Bonechiller and Drifter were placed on the board. Where the Board Game uses different dual sided hex tiles the world of <em>Frosthaven </em>has been more built out. In the snowy forest where I faced a group of Algox raiders the edges of the playable space were built up with rocks and foliage before drifting off into a haze. It didn't feel like the landscape stopped, but that it just wasn't in focus, leading to a better sense of immersion in the world.</p>

<h2>UI And Player Tooltips</h2>

<p>Speaking of the Beta feedback UI/UX was one that Petkov highlighted to me. "That's why we're doing the demo, that's why we are doing Early Access. It's so important because this game is really hard to do when it comes to UI. You want to shortcut things, then some people get mad because they want the agency, right?"</p>

<p>Character portraits appeared to the left, a list of combat participants to the top of the screen, and a list of selectable cards flew out in front of me. Each card I hovered over presented all of the information required in a quick and easy to digest format.</p>



<p>Petkov also showed me with a single key additional tool tips could be expended out related to just about anything your cursor is hovering over. If you want to know what the symbols are on a card, what any character has in their inventory, or even more information about an enemy fighter you can quickly gather it.</p>

<p>This is the kind of efficiency that I can imagine getting a lot of use out of at the start of the game, that would make me far more glad in the late game when I don't need any of that information and want less text and windows to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, while playing I did notice that there were a lot of 'confirmation' steps, that took place. You'd select two cards and then confirm, select where you want a character to move and have to confirm, pick the only enemy next to your character and have to confirm the attack.</p>

<p>At any point where it looked like my clicks weren't working around the screen my eyes began to learn to dart to the bottom of the screen to see if a red "Confirm" box had appeared.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=IvrGOpej 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=4z35xhhK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I won't give the full play by play my Drifter and Bonechiller were able to swiftly dispatch the Algox in the first room and approach a door made of Ivy to open up the second room. Before reaching the (currently burning) gates of <em>Frosthaven </em>you could see a hint of it in the fog surrounding the map. A neat tease for something big you're about to open up a door into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Differences In Difficulty and Enemy AI</strong><br>
Alongside the standard <em>Frosthaven </em>gameplay, there is also a Story mode as well as a mode with increased difficulty. Based on feedback from the Open Beta they have made it that the enemy AI tends to move in a way that's better for the player, as that's how a lot of people play at home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skipping through the rest of the battle I was introduced to the settlement building phase. Here there were a wide variety of options presented to me. Build and upgrade buildings, purchase new equipment or try to upgrade it with resources, and even potion creation where trial and error can lead to the discovery of new recipes.</p>

<p>This isometric view of <em>Frosthaven</em>, with plenty of empty plots of land, showed off just how far you'll be able to go when you get your hands on the game.</p>



<p><em>Frosthaven</em>, the board game, is an epic experience. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8e2e88-4e90-4808-88d3-e7f73952c19d" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/frosthaven-unboxing-is-lengthy-and-almost-perfect" rel="nofollow">A heavy box filled with all manner of characters, cards, boards, maps, and booklets</a>. If you're able to get the box, a consistent group of friends, and the time to play it's well worth the experience. It's also understandable that for many getting the stars to align in such a way can just be impossible.</p>

<p>With the <em>Frosthaven </em>video game a lot of the stress of time and setup is washed away, with voice acting and beautiful (and scary) environments this is already shaping up to be an incredible way to experience <em>Frosthaven </em>without a number of the barriers to entry.</p>

We can’t wait for players to experience Anku’s journey.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Whitethorn Games:</p><blockquote><p>A heartfelt, colorful puzzle platformer, the game draws inspiration from the rich culture of the indigenous Aymara people of the Andes. <em>Colorbound</em> immerses players in a warm, minimalistic setting as they guide a young boy on his journey to reunite his beloved late grandfather’s band for one final concert.</p><p>In <em>Colorbound</em>, the power of color is the key to opening up the path forward. Young Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician whose band brought immense joy to their people. After his passing, Anku sets off on a journey to seek out the scattered musicians, help them to find their neglected instruments, and reunite them for a final tribute performance in memory of a great man. Equipped with the ability to harness the power of color to shape the environment around him, Anku must collect and add colors to his palette and use them to change the way he interacts with the world, and find ways to open up new paths. Combining light platforming with environmental and logic puzzles, players will lead him through each setting—from dusty deserts to cities in ruin to flourishing forests—and help him reach his goal.</p><p>Winner of the Latin American Game Showcase Game Jam 2025, and created under the theme “What the Eyes Don’t See, the Heart Doesn’t Feel,” <em>Colorbound</em> was not only a favorite of the Game Jam attendees, but of the jury selection as well.

Yet in the months that follow, Anna is haunted by visions of violence and death, compelling her to create disturbing drawings that rapidly manifest into horrifying reality.</p><p>Desperate to free her of this affliction, Caroline travels to the remote town of Villa Hess and a mysterious clinic nestled deep within the mountains of southern Chile. But behind the warm smiles of the facility’s serene staff lies a sickening truth, and the sisters soon find themselves at the center of an entirely new nightmare…</p><p><strong>So What’s Included in the Demo?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This first playable demo features roughly 60 minutes of gameplay, beginning with the sisters’ long journey to Villa Hess and their arrival at the convent-turned-clinic as recommended by Caroline’s long-standing friend and psychiatrist, Isabella. Greeted by the cheerful Sister Angelica, a member of the convent’s secretive sisterhood, the pair seem initially at ease. But during the night Caroline wakes to find Anna missing and following the sounds of her screaming, rushes headfirst into the horrifying scene of her sister’s abduction. Trapped in a stranglehold, Caroline begins to lose consciousness as the sisterhood’s matriarch, Mother Lucia reveals her plan to capture the Wildberger twins and continue the unthinkable work of their grandfather, Noah… </p><p>Coming around in the convent’s infirmary, Caroline must now navigate the claustrophobic passageways of the convent in search of her missing sister. But as she ventures deeper into the shadowy facility, she soon discovers that she is not alone and that an ancient evil calls from below…  </p><p><strong>An Insight Into Caroline’s New Look</strong></p><p>As many of our fans will know, <em><a title="Games > Tormented Souls [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tormented-souls">Tormented Souls</a></em> was initially conceived as a love letter to the iconic third-person survival horror titles of the 90s and early 00s. These games shared some fairly outlandish plots as well as memorable protagonists whose designs effortlessly combined B-movie horror aesthetics with the eye-catching fashion trends of the time. Looking back on Claire Redfield’s Queen-quoting biker jackets in <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil 2 (2019) [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-2-2019">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em>Code Veronica</em>, and Aya Brea’s none-more-nineties denim in <em>Parasite Eve II</em> got us thinking about our design for Caroline Walker in <em>Tormented Souls II</em>. Had we moved too far away from our influences? Would Caroline’s silhouette still be recognizable? What would Caroline think about her militaristic, combat-ready new look?</p><p>These questions led us to revisit her design once more, going over and picking out all the key details of her outfit from the original game, and seeking to “evolve” her look for the sequel. The most important point was that following the events of the first game, Caroline has grown up. She’s very much in BIG SISTER mode now, and so needs to look suitably mature. This is reflected in her color palette, with the blood red of her dress contrasting dramatically with the scuffed leather of her jacket, which conveniently helps to pick her out of the multitude of dark environments that she’ll be exploring throughout the game.</p><p>We also wanted to retain elements of her design so as to keep her silhouette relatively consistent between games. This meant bringing back the dress and jacket combo, as well as Caroline’s taste for floral patterns, bows, and leather. Some of you might remember the evolution of The Prince’s design from <em><a title="Games > Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2026) [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-2026">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> to <em>Warrior Within</em>. Across games, he retained his flowing sash, chunky arm bracers, and loose-fitting trousers, but undeniably looks more bad-ass in the sequel. This is very much the approach we took with Caroline’s new look, and we hope our players will enjoy the familiarity it now brings! Also bonus points for anyone who noticed the Alice Abernathy reference.</p></blockquote><p><em>Tormented Souls II</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464280/Tormented_Souls_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/tormented-souls-2-28a1eb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tormented_souls_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>“Sisterhood” Story Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tormented Souls 2 | 'Sisterhood' Story Teaser Trailer - Steam Demo OUT NOW!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEAIvincLiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a>? That was a bloody lovely game. I'm always partial to a game where photography is the core mechanic, there's such a specific joy in navigating a space attempting to capture a fracture of its essence. Photo modes just aren't the same, I want someone to textually give me a camera and send me on my way. A sequel was announced last year, quite simply called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem-2">Toem 2</a>, and during yesterday's Day of the Devs, some gameplay was shown off for the first time.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Essentially, it looks like more of the same (which I want to quickly make clear is a wonderful thing), albeit clearly with a few more years of artistic experience under the developers' belts. Environments are fully 3D now, rather than what (I'm guessing) were all 2D textures mapped onto 3D objects. You're still out on an adventure, taking pictures along the way to uncover a phenomenon that is being kept hush, hush for the time being.

<p>
The sequel will feature special NPCs called Friends (aww), all of which have their own unique questline. Once you've wrapped up a quest, they'll give you a camera tool like, uh, scissors! Which cut things! As scissors are want to do. Or you'll get a hammer, no prize for guessing what that does. None of these things sound particularly camera related, but they look like fun ways to interact with the world. You can jump around and climb things now too, lots of ways to have some fun outside of taking a picture of a cheeky gnome.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for Toem 2 just yet, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">here</a>!

<hr>
<p>Despite how monumentally groundbreaking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> was on the Switch (and the Wii U, for that matter), there’s no denying that the game struggled ever-so-slightly under the weight of its ambitions. A quick trip into Korok Forest confirms as much, with the frame rate plummeting at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was never enough to ruin what was one of the greatest games of all time. But in the lead up to the Switch 2’s announcement, there was definitely a part of me that wondered just what BOTW <em>could</em> be like on beefier hardware.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156623/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I need not fantasise anymore, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is here, and it's absolutely <em>glorious</em>. Offered up via either a paid upgrade or as part of a Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, this update boasts enhanced resolution of up to 4K (1080p in handheld), rock-solid 60fps frame rate throughout, faster load times, an extra save file, and... the rather terrible Zelda Notes mobile app.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start with the positives, of which there are many. Thanks to the boost in resolution and frame rate, the Switch 2 version of BOTW <em>is</em> the best way to play a modern classic. There's no going back, folks, this is it.</p>
<p>From the moment you exit the Shrine of Resurrection and gaze across the horizon, the improvements are immediately apparent. Mountains and trees in the distance are now significantly clearer with gorgeous detail, and swinging the camera around reveals just how unfathomably smooth the performance is.</p>
<p>I'm not kidding, there wasn't a moment for me when the frame rate faltered. Whether I lobbed a bomb into a Bokoblin camp littered with exploding barrels, pranced around Korok Forest, parried an attack from a Guardian, or whatever else the game could chuck at me, it all ran flawlessly. Nintendo did the best with the hardware it had back in 2017, but the Switch 2 Edition represents BOTW at its absolute finest.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156632/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, with the enhancements and the natural passage of time, some textures are starting to look a little long in the tooth - rocks big and small, mainly, but since the world is absolutely littered with the things, you'll notice it quite a bit. It's a minor quibble, of course, and the game largely still looks incredible thanks to the absurd scale and beautiful art design.</p>
<p>With such robust performance enhancements, you'd think load times might take a bit of a hit, but it's actually quite the opposite. Thanks to the Switch 2's extra power, loading screens are now much zippier than ever before. Granted, you're still looking at around five or six seconds when teleporting or entering a shrine, so it's hardly instantaneous, but it's a <em>lot</em> quicker.</p>
<p>So, from a technical standpoint, BOTW is much improved. This is the same game you know and love, but now better-looking and smoother than you ever thought possible. If you want to experience the enhancements from the start of the game without getting rid of your original progress, you can – the Switch 2 Edition introduces a second save file, which might sound somewhat inconsequential on paper, but it's a lifesaver for those who want a fresh start but are hesitant to overwrite their save.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156624/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo didn't stop there, though. Oh no. You've also got a bunch of extra content, too! The catch, however, is that it's not in the game itself, but rather via the Zelda Notes hub stored within the Nintendo Switch mobile app. And, to put it bluntly, it's naff.</p>
<p>To give credit where it's due, the ability to sync up your gameplay almost perfectly to the app is actually quite impressive. It knows exactly where you are in the environment, and this in turn allows you to use a couple of interesting features.</p>
<p>The first of these — and perhaps the most significant — is 'Voice Memories', which features voice work from Patricia Summerset as Princess Zelda to provide bits of history and anecdotes on a whole bunch of landmarks littered throughout Hyrule. Discovering these hinges on a beeping sound via the app that indicates how close you are to a Voice Memory, kind of like how the Sheikah Sensor works for Shrines. You can turn this off if it gets annoying (which it <em>does</em> – very quickly), but then you have to keep glancing at your phone to monitor a little yellow flashing symbol.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156625/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the Voice Memories themselves, while perfectly harmless, aren't interesting or vital enough to warrant having to put up with the incessant beeping or looking at your phone all the time. I play games to switch off from the outside world, so having a constant reminder that my phone is there is borderline infuriating. Either put this stuff in the game itself, or don't bother.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Navigation feature lets you locate specific characters or structures in the world, like Koroks and Shrines. Chances are that if you've been playing BOTW since 2017 you've probably already found everything worth searching for. For everyone else, this is basically a way to achieve 100% completion. Like the Voice Memories, you can activate a voiceover to point you in the right direction, but having a repetitive voice that sounds like a sat nav in a traditional fantasy setting is horrendously jarring.</p>
<p>You've also got a Daily Bonus feature, acting as a roulette wheel to grant you various perks, like weapon repairs and meals. I've got nothing against this, as it's essentially like activating an amiibo without actually having to grab an amiibo. You can also view play data, tinker around with in-game photos, and even exchange items with other players.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156631/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you find yourself using and enjoying Zelda Notes, then that's wonderful – more power to you. But I just couldn't get on with it at all. The very notion of using a smartphone to access bonus features completely yanked me out of what is otherwise an all-encompassing experience. Voice Memories, Navigation, and even the Daily Bonus features could have all been implemented in the game itself, and honestly, Zelda Notes' only saving grace is that it's not enabled automatically. Just leave it be.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is undoubtedly the best way to play one of the greatest games of all time. The visual and performance enhancements remove any issues that you may have had to endure with the original game. It's practically flawless from that perspective.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Zelda Notes app really brings the whole thing down. Useful features that should have been implemented in-game have been relegated to your smartphone, and using it completely breaks immersion in this incredible world. I'm only thankful that it's not even remotely mandatory. Leave Zelda Notes to one side, and you've got the definitive presentation of a modern classic.</p></section>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626350/Pekoe/">Pekoe</a> developer Kitten Cup Studio and publisher Big Blue Sky Games debuted a new trailer for Kitten Cup Studio's upcoming cozy narrative-driven puzzle game, Capy Castaway, during today's Women-Led Games 2025 Summer Showcase event as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Capy, a capybara that gets separated from their parents after a flood rushes through the zoo where they live. When Capy comes to, a small crow, Corvi, finds them, and the two vow to help each other in their search for home.</p>
<p>"<em>Capy Castaway is inspired by our hometown of Toronto and the true story of Bonnie and Clyde - the runaway capybaras from Toronto's High Park Zoo in 2016,</em>" said chief executive officer and creative director at Kitten Cup Studio, Saffron Bolduc-Chong in a press release.</p>
<p>Not only is Capy Castaway set in Toronto, it also features some Toronto talent not already in the Kitten Cup Studio development team, with an original soundtrack composed by Toronto's Mark Sparling, who previously composed the music for 2019's beloved indie game, A Short Hike.</p>
<p>"<em>The game is heavily inspired by familiar places and things that bring us joy, and we wanted to capture a sort of intuitive playfulness. When we're playing through the game and think, 'Hey, wouldn't it be fun if we could just wear this yuzu on our heads?' and then we try it out. Suddenly, you have a mechanic where you can stack 10 yuzus on your head, and I love it. We can't wait for players to experience the heartfelt story of Capy Castaway, but also to enjoy the wonder and charm of being a silly little guy."</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Capy Castaway Character Trailer | Wholesome Direct 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dv1mi6TON0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Blue Sky Games president Tony Roma added "<em>We're thrilled to help bring Kitten Cup Studio's vision to life; Capy Castaway is a thoughtful, imaginative and full of heart - exactly the kind of experience we want to champion. The game's story of unlikely connection unfolds in a vibrant wold filled with peaceful gameplay, calming music and charmingly funny dialogue - one that players won't want to leave</em>."</p>

But it’s also a great place to find things to play now — and that’s especially true this year. The 2025 edition of the livestream showcase included a number of games that released during the show itself.</p><p>So if you like what you see, there’s no wait at all.</p><p>Finally, a game that combines designing your own house with going on a road trip. <em>Camper Van: Make it Home</em> is exactly what it sounds like. On the design side, you’re able to customize a tiny home camper and make it appropriately cozy, but the developers say it will also take you on “a journey of self-discovery.”</p><div><p id="fireside-feelings"><h2><em>Fireside Feelings</em></h2></p></div><p>This game seems designed entirely around comfort. You play as a cute little animal and spend your time curled up around a fire, chatting with friends, and guiding the conversation as you get pulled into a bigger story.</p><p>Puzzle game meets scrapbooking. Here the goal is to organize a huge cache of family photos, and as you do, discover their history and story. “Inspired by the way elders pass down family history using pictures to support their storytelling,” the developers explain, “this game blends narrative, puzzle, and creativity.”</p><p>This game is almost worth checking out for the pun title alone. In it, you create all kinds of weird omelets on a conveyor belt to deliver to students with seemingly very weird taste buds. Also, the principal is a rooster.</p><p>From the same team behind the similarly gothic <em>A Mortician’s Tale</em>, this game has players exploring a chill cemetery that changes based on the time of day and season.

In addition to all of the number-based puzzle solving, <em>Squeakross</em> also has some collecting elements, where you can gather decorations and stickers to up the cozy factor.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Inlusio Interactive</cite></p></div><p>This hand-drawn adventure game looks absolutely stunning, like an animated movie come to life, and it stars a little guy who can change shape to explore the natural world in various contexts. While the whole experience isn’t available yet, you can play the game’s first episode now.</p><p>This game may give you a craving for Boss Coffee, but it also looks pretty laid-back. It’s described as a “charming idle simulation game,” and the goal is to build an empire of vending machines, where you’ll have to manage staff and handle decorations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
