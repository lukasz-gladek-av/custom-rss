              <p>A 57-inch Dual 4K display with 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and Quantum Mini-LED backlighting. If those specs made your pulse quicken, you already understand what the <strong>Samsung Odyssey Neo G9</strong> represents. This is the monitor that replaces a dual-screen setup with one massive curved panel delivering 7,680 x 2,160 resolution. DisplayPort 2.1 and AMD Freesync Premium Pro complete a spec sheet that reads like a wish list. And the good news, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/">has slashed the price to $1,499 for Black Friday, down from $2,299</a>. That’s a 35% discount and the lowest this flagship gaming monitor has ever been.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best 57-Inch Monitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>57-inch panel gives you two 32-inch 4K monitors fused into one</strong> seamless ultrawide display. No bezels interrupting your view, no alignment issues between screens, and no messing with software to manage multiple inputs. The <strong>dual UHD resolution</strong> means you get the exact same pixel density and clarity across the whole surface. Spreadsheets, video editing timelines, and game worlds all enjoy that ridiculous amount of horizontal space.</p>



<p>The <strong>1000R curvature</strong> wraps the screen around your field of view in a way flat monitors simply cannot replicate. This aggressive curve matches the natural shape of human vision to reduce eye strain during marathon sessions. The edges of the screen stay equidistant from your eyes, which keeps everything in focus without constant head position adjustments. Immersion in racing games and flight simulators goes to a new level.</p>
<p>The backlighting is powered by <strong>Quantum Mini-LED technology that features 2,392 individual local dimming zones</strong>. These zones independently govern their brightness to provide deep blacks alongside brilliant highlights, with no blooming or halo effects. The Quantum Matrix processing drives these zones at 12-bit precision, yielding more than 4,000 levels of brightness gradation. Dark scenes in horror games are rendered with inky shadows, while bright elements pop without washing out the surrounding areas. Traditional edge-lit monitors seem flat and lifeless compared to this.</p>
<p>The DisplayHDR 1000 certification<strong> guarantees 1,000 nits of peak brightness</strong> and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. These numbers equate to visible detail in both the darkest corners and brightest explosions of any game that you play. Enemies that were hiding in the shadows now become visible without cranking gamma settings that wash out everything else. HDR content finally looks the way it was intended by creators when you have hardware capable of showing the full dynamic range. Movies and streaming content also benefit massively from this level of contrast performance.</p>



<p>The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate, combined with a 1ms response time</strong>, means competitive-grade responsiveness on this massive panel. Fast-paced shooters and racing games show fluid motion with no ghosting or blur trails behind moving objects. DisplayPort 2.1 provides the bandwidth necessary to push Dual 4K resolution at these refresh rates with support for variable refresh rates.</p>
<p>Connectivity options cover every scenario you might encounter: <strong>DisplayPort 2.1</strong> handles the heavy lifting for maximum performance gaming, while <strong>HDMI 2.1 ports</strong> connect current-gen consoles at their highest output capabilities. The integrated USB hub reduces cable clutter by letting you plug peripherals directly into the monitor. If you need to monitor different sources, picture-by-picture mode can display two separate inputs simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is an incredible value at $1,499 for such cutting-edge display tech. This Black Friday price knocks off a whopping $800 compared to retail and brings a flagship monitor into reach for serious gamers.</p>

It's been 10 years since Fatshark's Warhammer Tide years kicked off, starting with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: End times - Vermintide</a>, and to celebrate that anniversary the developer has been offering up various in-game events and updates in both Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> received a free new level, a point we'll come back to, but the big thing you should know first is that you can pick up the co-op dark fantasy game for free on Steam right now, and keep it forever.
</p>
<p>
Literally all you need to do is head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">Steam page</a>, and add it to your library. Easy as pie, cheap as chips! Or cheaper than chips, I suppose. As a word of warning, don't dilly dally on picking it up if you are interested in checking out the game. The offer is only running until November 24th, in a couple of days time, according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/600795607306601669?l=english">Steam blog post</a>, so best get on it right away.
</p>

<span>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Return to the Reik | Release Trailer</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtdlQ1srVEQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KtdlQ1srVEQ?autoplay=1" title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Return to the Reik | Release Trailer">

<p>
Anyway, that new level! It's called Return to the Reik, and it's already available to pick up, again completely for free. This one should be familiar to those that have played the first Vermintide, as it originally featured in that game. In the Vermintide 2, River Reik now apparently has "expanded, boat‑focused gameplay." As you can see in the above trailer, that does involve some boat on boat shenanigans, complete with the game's usual combat. Looks pretty neat!
</p>
<p>
There were a few fixes, tweaks, and features added in with this new level too, which you can read about in this other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546748595947175982">Steam blog post</a>. Happy vermintiding!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-hue-is-offloading-its-10ft-smart-lightstrips-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-no-name-alternatives-2000646503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/philips-hue-is-offloading-its-10ft-smart-lightstrips-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-no-name-alternatives.1361725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting turns any room from ordinary to extraordinary with a tap of your phone. Philips Hue lightstrips tuck behind TVs, under cabinets, along staircases or around ceiling edges to create ambient glow that sets the perfect mood. The trick is buying several to really tie a space together and Black Friday finally makes that affordable: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/">has dropped the 10-foot <em>Solo</em> light strip to $46, down from $76 (40% off)</a>. This is the lowest price ever recorded and you won’t find Philips Hue discounts anywhere else during this sale period.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
<p>Cheap LED strips are flooding the market but Philips Hue earns its reputation through <strong>superior color accuracy and build quality</strong>. That sets this strip apart from basic RGB alternatives that inevitably have issues delivering clean white light. Most budget strips attempt to achieve white tones by blending red, green, and blue LEDs together which is what causes that weird purple or green tint you’ve probably seen. Philips includes dedicated warm and cool white LEDs solely to deliver pure, natural whites alongside the full color spectrum.</p>



<p>Brightness counts when you’re lighting up larger spaces, and the <strong>Philips light strip delivers 1700 lumens of output</strong>. That’s enough to serve as functional accent lighting rather than just decorative glow. You can use it as under-cabinet task lighting in the kitchen or soft ambient illumination behind a media center. The premium silicone sleeve with a milky white finish diffuses the light for even dispersion, eliminating those harsh LED hotspots that make cheaper strips look cheap.</p>
<p>Installation takes minutes with the adhesive backing built into the strip: Just peel off the protective layer, stick it where you want it, and plug it in. You can cut this strip to size for your particular space, but you won’t be able to reconnect the pieces once they’re cut. Do your planning in advance to save a headache. The 10-foot length works perfectly for TV backlighting, bed frames, desk setups, or shorter ceiling runs around a room.</p>
<p>The Philips Hue app unlocks your lightstrip’s full potential once you’re all set up. You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors and adjust brightness levels</strong> to your liking with real precision. Once you start creating scenes that match your activities, it gets addictive: Be it movie nights with a warm orange glow, morning routines with energizing daylight tones or late-night gaming with deep purple ambiance-all in one strip.</p>



<p>Voice control integration through A<strong>lexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit works seamlessly</strong>. Telling your speaker to dim the lights or change colors feels genuinely futuristic the first few times you do it. Hands-free control proves especially useful when you’re cooking, lounging on the couch, or turning in for bed. The lightstrip responds quickly to commands with no noticeable lag. You can also group it with other smart devices for coordinated whole-home automation.</p>
<p>Adding a Philips Hue Bridge extends the functionality of your lightstrip even further: The Bridge enables various forms of automation such as having the lights sync with sunrise and sunset times, or having specific scenes turn on when you arrive home. It offers you much more stable connectivity and allows for control from anywhere through the cloud. Compatible with Matter, your Hue system will work seamlessly with other smart home ecosystems.</p>
<p>At $46, this Philips Hue Solo light strip is a great value in premium smart lighting. You’re getting true RGBWW color accuracy, impressive 1700-lumen brightness, seamless smart home integration, and the reliability of an established brand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Mountain Dew green colors. The loud marketing campaigns. The Xbox 360 felt like Microsoft trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mtv-special-20-years-elijah-wood-future-gaming-1851780248">but its way</a> into the console gaming big leagues. Through the unexpected collision of developer-friendly tech, consumer affordability, and digital-first initiatives, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111">Xbox 360</a> organically bootstrapped its way into being one of the best consoles ever.</p> <p>It didn’t just capture the late 2000s gaming imagination, it defined the zeitgeist and forged experiences that feel as formative as the early days of the NES or PlayStation 1. To mark the console’s 20th anniversary and lasting impact, here are the Xbox 360 memories that still stick with us:</p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>1.</strong> The first time I earned an in-game achievement, something clicked in my brain. I believe it was for completing the training level in </span><i><span>Call of Duty 2</span></i><span>. I remember how nice it felt to get a little pop-up reward from the game. I then spent the next many, many years collecting achievements on Xbox 360, subjecting myself to games like </span><i><span>Full Auto</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Perfect Dark Zero</span></i><span> in the hunt for more points. And while I think achievements aren’t that exciting anymore, I do still love the idea of having this record of things I’ve played and done across now three generations of Xbox consoles. I’m happy every other platform stole this idea, too. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>2.</strong> When the incredible </span><i><span>Pac-Man Championship Edition </span></i><span>came out, I became embroiled in a fierce high score battle with a few acquaintances. Every night I’d get home from work to see that one of them had just barely slipped past me, and so I’d lose myself for hours in the neon vibes and clubby beats of its arcade action, relying on pure instinct, trying again and again and again until I finally secured my victory over them on the leaderboards. It was pure arcade bliss. (Carolyn Petit)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>3.</strong> The first and last time I ever ordered a pizza on a video game console happened in 2013. Pizza Hut launched an app on the Xbox 360 and offered a promotion that let you get a pizza for 15 percent off. I ordered a pepperoni pie, stuffed-crust of course, and consumed it while playing B</span><i><span>lack Ops 2.</span></i><span> Little did I know life would rarely be this good again. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>4.</strong> My first 360 memory was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tdu-x360">Tom Bramwell</a> bringing his pre-release machine over to my flat before it was out, and we played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-condemned-pc"><em>Criminal Oranges</em></a> and <em>Kameo</em> and worried for the machine’s chances. </span><span>But then after that, all <em>Geometry Wars</em>, all the time. (John Walker)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><strong>5.</strong> My girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend moved into their apartment during the last year of college. He had an Xbox 360 with <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. I slept over often staying up with him until one or two in the morning fighting Juggernauts in Special Ops missions and running Model 1887 Akimbo through Terminal while drinking a case of Lion’s Head. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>6.</strong> It might sound silly now, but </span><i><span>Gears of War 3 </span></i><span>is burned into my brain because of one character’s death. Late in the game, spoilers for those who haven’t played it, Dom sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the others from doom. My brother and I had played through the first two games multiple times and had developed a connection with this world and the characters. He was always Dom. I was always Marcus. And there was something oddly compelling and sad about watching my digital brother sacrifice himself to save me. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>7.</strong> I’m still chasing the high of that first <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>. It came to XBLA in late 2011 when I was living in my first apartment after college. My best friend and I were hooked on the tower defense RPG loop, hoovering up crystals and maxing every character. I’ve never played anything as intensely since. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p> <hr> <p><span><strong>8.</strong> The foundational memory I have of the Xbox 360 was that, when the box launched in 2005, I wasn’t allowed to play it. My twin brother and I got one the following January because they were on back order, so I spent a couple months staring wistfully at the games we’d bought ahead of time. But I had recently failed my seventh-grade math class with a 64, and rather than investing in tutoring or anything to support me in a subject I clearly struggled with, my mother decided to punish me by not allowing me to play the shiny new console. </span></p>

 <p><span>I still did, obviously. I just waited until my mother went to sleep. I beat </span><i><span>Kameo: Elements of Power </span></i><span>in the dead of night and honed my skills in </span><i><span>Dead or Alive 4</span></i><span> when no one was awake to notice. My mother eventually found out because my local youth minister was a narc and was listening in on every conversation my friends and I were having. But I beat 360 games months earlier than I was supposed to. In retrospect, that was a lot of drama for something so insignificant as a middle school math class. But hey, those late-night play sessions were worth it. (Kenneth Shepard)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>9.</strong> I borrowed <em>Catherine</em> from a friend and played it at the exact time my girlfriend and I were on a break over my own commitment issues. That precise combination of puzzle platforming panic, existential dread, and demonic nightmares will never leave me. I can still hear the music as Vincent sits in the bar bathroom watching his low-stakes life unravel over text message. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>10.</strong><i> Halo 3</i></span>. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a multiplayer experience quite like that one again. I have many good memories of killer matches and chill hang out sessions. But I’ll always remember when folks started spotting players wearing the “Recon” helmet and were obsessed over trying to figure out how to unlock it long before the armor piece became available to the public. Me, being the kind of person I was at the time (and maybe still am?) would often hop onto social, unranked matches to try and convince people I knew how to get the armor. No, I didn’t scam them. I just wasted their time, taking them to various corners of the game’s maps and asking them spin around in circles, empty all their ammo in the corner, stand on top of each other to build a ladder to where I promised them the Recon armor was hiding, or recite strange cryptic sounding sentences I made up on the spot. I’m sorry if you were one of those people whose time I wasted. But it was really, really funny to me. Thanks for the memories. (Claire Jackson)</p> <hr> <p><strong>11.</strong> Waiting for <em>Bastion</em> to come to XBLA’s Summer of Arcade felt like being back in the ’90s. Digital downloads still felt novel. They were giving birth to an entirely new generation of retro-inspired indie giants. I played it my SD TV left over from college up in my parent’s attic during July with no air conditioning. I was still sweating even in the middle of the night as Logan Cunningham raspy voice unfurled a broken world hope, despair, and beautiful colors. It felt like I was looking at the past and the future simultaneously. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-nuclear-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-now-cheaper-than-budget-alternatives-2000646499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The noise-cancelling headphones market has become incredibly crowded with Sony, Bose, Apple, Sonos and others fighting for your attention. Each brand also offers multiple models at many different price points and if I’m being honest, the differences between them have gotten increasingly tough to justify.</p>
<p>At a certain point, when premium ANC headphones are all performing fantastically, the smartest move is finding the best deal and pulling the trigger. And the great news is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">that the Bose QuietComfort headphones have dropped to $199 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>. That’s 43% off a legendary pair of cans, and the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on these.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Name That Defined Noise Cancellation Still Delivers</h2>
<p><strong>Bose invented the category of consumer noise-cancelling headphones</strong> and has refined the QuietComfort line over decades. That heritage shows in how effortlessly these headphones eliminate ambient noise: the hum of airplane engines, office chatter, city traffic, and noisy coffee shops-all just fade into silence when you put them on. At the same time, the ANC technology automatically changes intensity with your surroundings, increasing or decreasing as needed.</p>



<p>Sound quality lives up to the Bose <strong>reputation for rich, balanced audio</strong>. Deep bass hits with authority without overwhelming mids and highs, which keeps music sounding natural across genres. Acoustic tracks feel intimate while electronic and hip-hop deliver the punch you’d expect. Bose tuned these headphones to sound great out of the box<strong> without requiring EQ adjustments</strong>, though the app lets you tweak things if you want.</p>
<p><strong>With 24 hours of battery life</strong>, you can make it through an entire week of commutes and work sessions on a single charge. When you’re in a rush, a quick 15-minute top-up adds roughly 2.5 hours of playtime. USB-C charging keeps things suitably simple and compatible with the cables you already own. Should you somehow manage to drain the battery completely during a long-haul flight, the headphones also work in wired mode.</p>
<p>Comfort is a huge factor when you’re having to wear headphones for long periods of time, and Bose really nailed the ergonomics here. The<strong> plush ear cushions create a seal without excessive clamping pressure</strong> against your head. The headband distributes weight evenly around your head, so you won’t feel soreness building up after a few hours. It feels premium in terms of build without being heavy, treading a nice line between durability and wearability.</p>



<p>The <strong>on-board microphone handles calls clearly</strong> enough for professional conversations. Colleagues and family members will hear you sans that muffled, distant quality that plagues many Bluetooth headphones. Wind noise reduction helps when you’re taking calls outdoors or in less-than-ideal conditions. It won’t replace a dedicated desktop setup for podcasting, but the mic performs quite well for everyday voice communication.</p>
<p>Bluetooth connectivity has been rock solid in real-world use: <strong>the headphones pair quickly</strong> and connections have remained stable even in busy wireless environments. Multipoint pairing lets you stay connected to two devices at once, perfect for toggling between your laptop and your phone. The Bose app offers further customizations, including adjustable EQ, ANC levels, and shortcut button assignments.</p>
<p>At $199, the Bose QuietComfort headphones are outstanding value in the premium ANC category. You’re getting legendary noise cancellation, refined sound quality, all-day battery life, and exceptional comfort from a brand that pioneered this entire product segment.</p>

<p>The Logitech POWERPLAY 2 is such a practical device and perfectly does what it says on the tin that there’s not a hell of a lot to comment on. It’s marketed as a wireless charging system that allows you to constantly power certain wireless gaming mice on a surface that’s synonymous with Logitech’s premium mouse pads. </p>



<p>And guess what? That’s exactly what it <strong>is </strong>and what it <strong>does</strong>. Read on to scope out this full POWERPLAY 2 review to see if it’s the kind of thing you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-logitech-powerplay-2-worth-119">Is the Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Worth $119?</h2>



<p>As I wrote this review, the POWERPLAY 2 was retailing for $119.99, which might seem steep when you can buy a G240 ‘cloth gaming mouse pad’ from the company for just $7.99.</p>



<p>So, why is the POWERPLAY 2 more than 12 times the price of a regular mouse pad?</p>



<p>The POWERPLAY 2 has integrated charging systems woven into the mat, which means that when the mouse pad is <strong>powered</strong>, it effortlessly charges your wireless gaming mouse. It achieves this by fusing the regular mouse pad surface with an unbroken charging layer that invisibly powers the device in your hand and keeps it topped up.</p>



<p>At 34.4cm by 34cm, it’s a fairly sizeable square thing that takes up a decent amount of space on your desk, and at the top of the mouse pad sits the POWERPLAY 2 power unit, which has a handy heads-up light letting you know when your mouse is being actively charged.</p>



<p>You simply pop the POWERPLAY 2 down on your desk, connect it to a powered USB port (at least 2.0), and that’s about it. To use a compatible mouse, you’ll use the POWERPLAY 2 COIN that’s included in the box.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that range of compatible gaming mice is <strong>diverse</strong>, but it’s limited exclusively to Logitech devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>G309</li>



<li>G502 X Plus (my mouse)</li>



<li>G502 X LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>G502</li>



<li>G703</li>



<li>G903</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT</li>



<li>PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>PRO Wireless</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a brilliant piece of technology, especially for someone who regularly forgets to charge their devices. I’ll never have that happen again, thanks to the Logitech POWERPLAY 2. That’s why I think it’s more than worth the money, but I can understand how it’ll be a deal-breaker for some, that it’s so expensive.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change.1361698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The portable power station market gets fiercely competitive during Black Friday, with brands like <em>Jackery</em> and <em>Anker</em> dropping prices to the $350-400 range. Here’s the thing though: most of those deals cap out at 1,500W output. Ecoflow just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">changed the equation by slashing the Delta 2 to $349, down from $699</a> and you’re getting here <strong>1,800W of continuous power</strong> for less than competitors charge for their smaller units. This<strong> 50% discount marks the all-time lowest price</strong> for a power station in this performance class, and it probably won’t last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Competitors Can’t Match at This Price</h2>
<p>The 1,800W output puts the Delta 2 in a different league than most portable power stations in this price range. That extra 300W compared to 1,500W competitors might sound modest on paper but it opens up a whole new category of appliances you can run. Power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, and small space heaters suddenly become viable options. The <strong>2,700W surge capacity</strong> handles startup spikes from compressors and motors without breaking a sweat. You’re essentially getting mid-tier performance at entry-level pricing.</p>



<p>The 1,024Wh capacity provides enough juice to keep your essentials running during extended outages or off-grid adventures. A full charge can power a mini fridge for about a day or keep your phones and laptops topped up for a week. Ecoflow designed the Delta 2 to be expandable too, so you can add extra batteries down the line if your needs grow.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives the Delta 2 a serious longevity advantage over traditional lithium-ion power stations: This type of battery maintains over <strong>80% capacity after 3,000 charge cycles which translates to roughly a decade of regular use</strong>. The chemistry is also inherently safer with better thermal stability and reduced fire risk. You can store it in your garage or RV without worrying about temperature extremes causing problems.</p>



<p>Charging speed is where EcoFlow really flexes its engineering muscle: The <strong>Delta 2 goes from empty to 80% in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, with no bulky external brick required. Solar charging maxes out at 500W input, so a couple of panels can fully recharge the unit in a few hours on a sunny day. You can even combine AC and solar charging simultaneously for maximum speed. That rapid turnaround keeps you powered up and ready to go when time matters.</p>
<p>The port selection covers pretty much every charging scenario you might encounter. <strong>Six AC outlets handle your larger appliances and power tools, while the 100W USB-C port delivers laptop-level charging speeds</strong>. Four additional USB-A ports and a 12V car outlet round out the options. Everything can run simultaneously without juggling or prioritizing devices. The built-in display shows real-time input and output wattage along with remaining capacity.</p>
<p>At $349, the EcoFlow Delta 2 delivers unmatched value in the portable power station category. You’re getting 1,800W output, LiFePO4 durability, ultra-fast charging, and expandable capacity for less than competitors charge for inferior specs. This Black Friday deal essentially gives you a $700 power station at half price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech LITRA BEAM LX Review—Minor Stream Item, Major Impact]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review%E2%80%94minor-stream-item-major-impact.1361695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was looking for a new lighting solution for my stream, as my old Logitech Litra had seen better days after being in continuous use for many years. Little did I realize, Logitech had since released an overhauled version – the <strong>LITRA BEAM LX</strong>. It’s an evolution in every way, offering a sweeping bar with intense RGB on one side and an extremely capable key light on the other.</p>



<p>For a while, I’ve had the LITRA BEAM LX sitting front and centre in my setup, and not only does it look fantastic, but it’s also the most effective key light I’ve ever used. It’s not the <strong>cheapest </strong>solution, and it requires a mains connection as well as USB-C hook-up, but if you can accommodate it, it’s one of the best additions you’ll ever make to your stream or video setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-litra-beam-lx-worth-129">Is the LITRA BEAM LX Worth $129?</h2>



<p>The LITRA BEAM LX is a handy, practical, and attractive key light that has transformed my setup. The original LITRA was a single ‘panel’ light that offered a few basic customization points, but the LITRA BEAM LX takes things to the next level and <strong>beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a dual-sided key light that comes equipped with Logitech’s clean ‘LIGHTSYNC’ RGB technology, fully customizable through the G Hub application, and a damn nice splash of color wherever you decide to put it.</p>



<p>As a versatile thing, the LITRA BEAM LX can be positioned either horizontally or vertically, like a light column. The base of the light is pretty hefty and takes up a bit of desk space, but it’s not too oppressive. It’s also a hefty thing that weighs around 1.5 KG, so bear that in mind and don’t put it anywhere it could get knocked over.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The LITRA BEAM LX does a perfect job of illuminating your face with a soft glow that doesn’t cast too many shadows</figcaption></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there’s not a huge amount you can say about a <strong>light</strong>, but if you’re in the market for a multi-functional and super-effective key light that offers remote customization, an easy install process, and genuinely satisfying effects, you’ll want to check out the LITRA BEAM LX.</p>



<p>It’s my daily driver, and at the time of writing, I had the RGB bar set up to mimic ARC Raiders colorways, while the key light perfectly brightens my streams of that same game. I think the only thing better than the LITRA BEAM LX would be TWO of these lights, to have them columned on either side of the monitor to eliminate any chance of shadows across the face.</p>



<p>Perfection.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-tv-backlight-is-going-for-pocket-change-netflix-hits-different-with-lights-that-react-to-your-screen-2000646475</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-tv-backlight-is-going-for-pocket-change-netflix-hits-different-with-lights-that-react-to-your-screen.1361677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Philips Hue dominated the smart lighting space but Govee quietly stole the crown by innovating faster and pricing lower than the legacy giant could match. The brand brings fresh ideas into connected lighting that Hue never considered, <strong>like TV backlights which react in real-time to on-screen content</strong>.</p>
<p>Govee <em>TV Backlight 3 Lite</em> wraps colors around your television that match what you’re watching, crafting immersive viewing that makes regular TVs feel incomplete. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">dropped this to $46 for Black Friday, down from $69, a record low that brings cinema-style ambiance to any living room</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Camera Sync Technology Matches Colors Instantly</h2>
<p>It has a <strong>built-in camera that would capture your TV screen and analyze colors in real time</strong> and projects matching hues onto the wall behind. Explosions glow orange across your wall, ocean scenes spread blue throughout the room, and forests extend green beyond the screen edges. This reactive lighting creates immersion that static backlights cannot achieve, pulling you deeper into whatever you’re watching. The fish-eye correction function improves color accuracy along the edges where older systems struggled.</p>



<p>Full compatibility means the system <strong>works with any TV content from whatever source</strong>. Streaming services, cable boxes, gaming consoles, and Blu-ray players all work easily without special setup or compatibility concerns. The camera captures whatever appears on screen without requiring HDMI passthrough or software integration.</p>
<p>This universal approach avoids the frustration of backlights only working with specific apps or devices. Gravitational hanger design facilitates camera installation on ultra-thin TVs, difficult to achieve with traditional mounts. The camera hangs securely, and adhesive stabilization inhibits wobble that would affect color detection accuracy.<strong> Installation takes minutes</strong>&nbsp;as opposed to the complicated mounting other systems require.</p>
<p>Govee <em>DreamView</em> syncing <strong>connects up to seven additional Govee lights for a 360-degree immersive experience</strong>. Floor lamps, table lights, and more from Govee also sync with your TV backlight to extend the color matching of your room.</p>



<p>Smart control via the Govee Home app supports scene modes, eliminates black bars, and detects a blank screen. You’ll be able to change settings, set custom scenes, and fine-tune the experience from the comfort of your couch. Voice control via Alexa and Google Assistant allows for hands-free operation to make any necessary quick adjustments during viewing.</p>
<p>You’re getting camera-synced reactive lighting with fish-eye correction and DreamView compatibility at $46, which is 33% off. Philips Hue Play gradient strips offer less flexibility with similar functionality and will set you back a minimum of US$200. With real-time color matching, multi-device syncing, and universal compatibility, the end result is cinema immersion at a fraction of the premium alternatives.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Maono PD200W Microphone Review—Suprisingly Affordable and Effective]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/maono-pd200w-microphone-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maono-pd200w-microphone-review%E2%80%94suprisingly-affordable-and-effective.1361674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Maono PD200W might not be the most obvious pick when it comes to looking for a new podcasting or streaming microphone, but it should certainly be one you at least consider. If you want to get into broadcasting your voice without breaking the bank, the Maono PD200W is a fantastic pick and offers plenty of bang for your buck.</p>



<p>I’ve spent a while testing the Maono PD200W and have some positive sentiments to share about it. Read on for my full take on the Maono PD200W, a ‘hybrid’ microphone that is self-dubbed the ‘world’s first wireless dynamic microphone for podcasting.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-maono-pd200w-microphone-worth-99">Is the Maono PD200W Microphone Worth $99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, the Maono PD200W microphone boasted a price tag of just $99, which is <strong>more than worth </strong>the investment. It might not be a Logitech, a Shure, or a Rode, but it’s <strong>brilliant </strong>for newcomers who want great sound quality in an attractive enough package without worrying about investing too much money right off the bat.</p>



<p>This tri-mode microphone is an innovation in itself. It can be used on a 2.4GHz band wireless connection, via USB, or XLR. It can also be used <strong>fully wirelessly </strong>using a dongle, which is nuts. I genuinely noticed very little in the way of audio loss between a wired and wireless connection, which is very surprising indeed.</p>



<p>I didn’t test this, but the battery should last (on paper at least) a whopping<strong> 60 hours</strong>, and both the broadcaster and receiver are so effective that you can have <strong>a 60-meter separation </strong>between them with low latency. If you’re on the go and want to keep crystal-clear audio quality in a microphone that looks premium, it makes so much sense to pick the Maono PD200W.</p>



<p>There’s also a 3.5mm jack, which allows you to pass through audio inputs. It’s convenient as heck.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Maono PD200W, it’s that it offers a dynamic microphone build, and I prefer cardioid for the more ‘directed’ input feel. That said, it offers great background noise elimination that can be further tweaked with Maono’s proprietary app, which allows you to further customize the unit.</p>



<p>And yes, that means you can alter the RGB output.</p>



<p>Maono insists the microphone is on par with Shure’s SM7B, one of the most popular microphones for podcasters and streamers.</p>



<p>I paired the Maono PD200W with the company’s BA37 boom arm, which took seconds to set up and is reminiscent of Elgato’s low-profile boom arm, which I already rated quite high.</p>



<p>At $99 for just the microphone or $129.99 for the microphone <strong>and </strong>the boom arm, you can’t really go wrong with the Maono PD200W. It’s a versatile and durable thing (it has a built-in shock mount and solid pop filter) that has plenty of range and looks great in front of your face on camera.</p>



<p>I tested the Maono PD200W across a range of applications (Audacity, OBS, Discord, Google Meet, Streamlabs) and was generally pleased with the results. The equalization needed tweaking to perfect the voice stream, but it took no time at all.</p>



<p>I’d hugely recommend it to new podcasters and aspirational streamers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99ll-never-see-a-console-reveal-like-the-xbox-360%E2%80%99s-ever-again.1361665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-best-worst-arcade-games-netflix-store-closing-1851610163">20 years ago on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360</a> and the future of video games was unveiled on MTV, and it was hosted by Elijah Wood. And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on May 12, 2025. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>But before we praise <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it:</p>

  <p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari, some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation.</p>

 <p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <a href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a>. The camera cuts to a…woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode.</p>

  <p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p>

 <p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet.</p>

 <p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad.</p> <p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-20-games-that-defined-the-xbox-360</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-20-games-that-defined-the-xbox-360.1361659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 turns 20 years old today, and so what better time to look back at the games that most defined the console. The 360 was not only the most successful machine Microsoft has ever made, but arguably the most beloved too. And for great reason: the second Xbox mixed powerful hardware with innovative, boundary-pushing, and risk-taking software to power a memorable generation that lasted eight years – longer than any other Xbox so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had a front-row seat to the Xbox 360 era from start to finish during my time at Official Xbox Magazine and then IGN, so here are my picks for the top 20 games that defined the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">20. 1 vs. 100</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/1vs100-1763561775617.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Microsoft’s boldest experiments in the Xbox 360 era was 1 vs. 100, a live game show where most players would be randomly selected to play along in The Crowd, while a lucky 100 would be chosen to be in The Mob and a single person would be chosen as The One. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You had to log on at specific times to play 1 vs. 100; it wasn’t available to you anytime you wanted to fire it up. Microsoft ran it with a live host from a studio in Seattle. But when you joined in for what was literally appointment gaming, you were rewarded with, in some cases, real-life prizes such as Microsoft Points – up to 10,000 for The One if they won, which is the equivalent of $125 – or free Xbox Live Arcade games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a truly unique social gaming experience emblematic of the creative risks and online bets Microsoft was taking and making in the Xbox 360 days, and though I was never selected to be The One, I was in the 100 once and won 80 Microsoft Points (aka $1). I know that might not sound like it was all that worthwhile, but I promise you it was as engaging and memorable as it was short-lived. My proudest Xbox Achievements are having all 12 of the possible 12 from 1 vs. 100, because the game is gone and, sadly, never coming back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">19. Viva Piñata </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/vivapinata-1763561822361.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long before Microsoft paid $69 billion for Activision-Blizzard, it shocked the world by purchasing a controlling stake in Nintendo second-party powerhouse Rare in 2002 for $375 million – the equivalent of over $600 million today. Viva Piñata wasn’t the first game the studio made for Microsoft – the fine-but-forgettable Grabbed by the Ghoulies came first in 2003 before Rare dropped two solid launch titles for the Xbox 360 in 2005: Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero. But its first bona fide hit for Xbox was 2006’s Viva Piñata, a life sim in which you grew and maintained your garden full of adorable piñata-fied animals. It spawned a sequel, a Nintendo DS handheld version, and a short-lived animated series. In hindsight, it was ahead of its time; it would seem to have great potential to thrive now in a world where Animal Crossing is a massive hit for Nintendo. But even back in the 360 days, it was Rare’s first defining moment for its new platform.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">18. Lost Odyssey</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/lostodyssey-1763561851397.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Xbox has ever successfully gained a real foothold in the Japanese gaming market, but you can’t say that Microsoft never tried. Arguably the company’s biggest push came in the Xbox 360 era, when one of the biggest overtures made to Japanese audiences by the American behemoth came when it partnered with legendary Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to help fund his new studio, Mistwalker. The two JRPGs Mistwalker created for Microsoft live on in Xbox lore: Blue Dragon, a cartoony adventure with art by another legend, Akira Toriyama, came first, arriving in Japan in 2006 and in the Xbox’s home market in the US in 2007. But it’s the second game – the darker, more serious, Unreal Engine-powered, four-DVD epic called Lost Odyssey, that showed the rest of the industry that the Xbox could go toe-to-toe with Sony and Nintendo in the JRPG department and wasn’t just a Western RPG powerhouse. No one questioned Xbox’s RPG credentials after that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">17. Dead Rising</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/deadrising-1763561866252.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">By default, every game released for the Xbox 360 during its first few months that wasn’t also available on the original Xbox – and there weren’t nearly as many cross-gen games back then as there are now – was an Xbox 360 exclusive, since the PlayStation 3 didn’t release until late 2006. Among those exclusives was one of the most memorable zombie games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s Dead Rising, which was produced by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, was something we truly hadn’t seen before: a triple-A game set inside a gigantic mall with literally hundreds of characters on the screen at any given time. And those characters, of course, were zombies. So, so many zombies. (Side note: one of the Xbox 360’s most famous Achievements – remember, the console invented those too – was the Zombie Genocider Achievement that required you to kill the number of zombies equivalent to the population of Willamette: 53,594). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was uniquely told on a timer – you had three in-game days to complete the story and, hopefully, escape the Willamette Mall. This resulted in numerous possible endings and, thus, ample reason to replay the campaign. Just as memorable was that as photojournalist Frank West, you could turn just about anything in the mall into a weapon. But you also earned Prestige Points by taking perfect pictures of the insanity around you – which you’d accumulate to level up and have a better chance of survival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was not only one of the defining games of Xbox 360’s first year, but it showed us that the “HD Era” was truly capable of giving us gaming experiences that we’d never had before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">16. Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/geometrywars-1763561890752.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2005</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Live Arcade – the brilliant indie-turned-small-scale-and-indie game publishing program that offered a curated selection of bite-sized games on a weekly basis (who remembers Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays?) – did as much to define the Xbox 360 as any triple-A game did. The most-downloaded Xbox Live Arcade game ever was Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, Bizarre Creations’ unlockable Project Gotham Racing 2 minigame that found a second life as a day-one debut download on the then-brand-new XBLA platform. Geometry Wars’s premise was deceptively simple: survive as long as you can while blasting larger and larger waves of encroaching enemies. For a lot of gamers, when they think of Xbox Live Arcade, the first thing they think of is Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Ninja Gaiden 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/ninjagaiden2-1763561912495.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation may have had God of War, but Xbox had Ninja Gaiden. The first in Ryu Hayabusa’s modern revival helped legitimize the Xbox as a viable platform for Japanese-developed games, and the Xbox 360-exclusive sequel upped the ante for the more powerful new console. It brought more weapons, more bosses, and more resolution, now that Ninja Gaiden was in HD (fun fact, though: the first game natively supported widescreen way back in 2005!). Oh, and it also served up a whole heck of a lot more blood thanks to the new dismemberment system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2’s action was far more violent thanks to your new ability to slice off the arms, legs, and heads from your foes. It only augmented an absolutely sublime fast-action combat system, even if having all those additional pixels couldn’t quite fix the troublesome camera. Sadly, this would prove to be series mastermind Tomonobu Itagaki’s final contribution to the franchise, but at the time, it asserted the Xbox 360 as the place to go for the best of any genre. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Braid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/braid-1763561934113.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if I say the words “Summer of Arcade,” it brings up positive memories for you. The annual promotion was a genius bit of Microsoft marketing that sought – successfully, I might add – to fill in the quiet summer months that tended to be devoid of major game releases with 4-5 weeks of curated heavy hitters in the indie and bite-sized game space. The very first one took place in 2008, and boy did it ever set the tone! Galaga Legions, Bionic Commando: Rearmed, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, Castle Crashers, and a platformer called Braid from a then-unknown developer named Jonathan Blow. Though smaller in scope than a traditional big-budget game, Braid had every bit the looks and the brains of one thanks to its distinct painterly artstyle and challenging time-manipulation-based puzzles. If everyone wasn’t paying attention to Xbox Live Arcade before Braid, they sure as heck were after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Crackdown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/crackdown-1763561955481.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is a double-edged sword that the original Crackdown will perhaps forever be thought of first and foremost as The Game That Came With the Halo 3 Beta. But anyone who bought Crackdown just to get a crack at playing Halo 3’s multiplayer for the first time quickly learned that the candy wrapper tasted just as good as the candy bar inside. Crackdown – the brainchild of original Grand Theft Auto creator David Jones – set players loose inside a comic-book-esque world as a would-be superhero with no rigid structure. Instead, you had total freedom to go anywhere and try anything in its Pacific City sandbox. That meant that, yes, you could make a beeline straight for the top kingpin of one of Crackdown’s gangs. You probably wouldn’t be powerful enough to take them down at that point, though – you got literally stronger in Crackdown by defeating enemies and picking up experience orbs of different flavors depending on how you took them down, such as with melee combat, in a vehicle, or with a gun. Eventually, you’d be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, lift cars over your head and throw them, and more. In a time when there weren’t a lot of good sandbox games not named Grand Theft Auto, Crackdown brought something fresh and fun to the table.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Forza Motorsport 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/forza-motorsport-3-1763561974755.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why Forza Motorsport 3 rather than Forza Motorsport 2, which was the first entry on the Xbox 360? Easy: because FM3 is where Forza passed Gran Turismo as the best simulation racing series in the world. Visually, the series always set the bar high, and its second lap on the 360 kept the pedal to the metal in that department. And the car list was never in question. But what Forza Motorsport 3 added was the Rewind mechanic that allowed you to press Y to reverse the action a few seconds if you crashed or took a turn too fast. You could turn it off, of course – Forza Motorsport was always nothing if not customizable – but it added a thick layer of accessibility and approachability to what had always been a pretty buttoned-up, serious racing sim. The Rewind feature only added to what I always called the “soul” of Forza – my vague but I think accurate way of describing the joy and spirit that Forza Motorsport always brought to players, whereas Gran Turismo, for all its simulation racing brilliance, always felt more…clinical. Forza Motorsport 3 was Turn 10’s turning point where the studio passed the competition and never looked back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Left 4 Dead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/left4dead-1763562044063.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve and partner Turtle Rock Studios (who Valve acquired mid-development) practically started the four-player PvE trend in shooters with Left 4 Dead, a brilliant, sometimes scary, and always replayable co-op shooter that had you proceeding through several five-level-long campaigns, surviving waves of zombie attacks thrown at you by the AI “Director” while you clamored for each map’s limited resources, seeking the shelter of the safe room at the end of each chapter. Its mechanics were simple but fun, and thanks to the Director’s always-changing placement of common and special enemies alike, it never quite played the same way twice. Plus, running an entire campaign only took 60-90 minutes to complete, so you and your friends could jump on Xbox Live, have fun together, and feel like you accomplished something by the time you signed off for the evening. It’s almost quaint to think about now in our current age of long-tail live-service games that try to keep you on a hamster wheel, grinding to the next unlockable or piece of content. But Left 4 Dead both respected your time and made great use of it. Many games have since imitated it, but none have ever topped it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Limbo</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/limbo-1763562065234.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2010</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Limbo didn’t come along until over halfway through the Xbox 360 generation, it is nevertheless the standard-bearer for what Xbox Live Arcade was capable of. Developer Playdead’s side-scrolling physics-based platformer told the harrowing story of a boy who…well, no one’s quite sure, really – there are many intriguing theories as to what the real story of Limbo is! But what’s not up for debate is that Limbo is about as close to perfect as a video game can get in terms of mechanics, art, animation, audio design, and polish. (Playdead’s next game, 2016’s Inside for Xbox One, would prove to somehow be even better than Limbo, but that’s a story for another day.) It was the perfect rebuttal to film critic Roger Ebert’s assertion from three months before Limbo released that video games weren’t and could never be art. Limbo defined Xbox Live Arcade, cementing Microsoft’s already established small-games platform as one of the very best things about the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Rock Band</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were a gamer in the late 2000’s, odds are you were either an active participant in the plastic-instrument rhythm-game craze that Guitar Hero started, or you knew someone who was. Developer Harmonix Music Systems built Guitar Hero but then sold it to Activision. That’s when the developer advanced the exploding genre forward with Rock Band, a four-player co-op game whose multiplayer experience is truly unlike anything else you’ve ever played. A singer, guitarist, bass player, and drummer worked together to hit the right notes as they came down the note highway, truly and emphatically delivering a convincing replica of the feeling real-life musicians have when they play together. Rock Band was truly remarkable, not just for its core gameplay and multiplayer alchemy, but also for its commitment to music. Harmonix added to the game’s music library with new songs via DLC <em>every single week </em>for <em>eight years</em>, eventually adding full albums like Pearl Jam’s Ten, Nirvana’s Nevermind, Rush’s Moving Pictures, Foo Fighters’ The Colour and the Shape, and more. Rock Band may not have been exclusive to the Xbox 360, but it was nevertheless a defining game for the console, standing out amongst the even heavier hitters coming up higher on this list that arrived at the same time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/oblivion-1763562122332.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 30-60 minutes into the first-person RPG The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, when you first emerged from the dungeon and into the open world for the first time, you spun your character around and your jaw dropped. A truly next-gen, high-definition world was all around you, and in it you could go anywhere and, seemingly, do anything. That Oblivion dropped so soon after the Xbox 360 launched – just four months into the new Xbox’s lifecycle, and while PlayStation gamers were still stuck on the PS2 that wasn’t capable of anything that looked remotely like it – only made Bethesda’s first console-on-day-one role-playing game that much more incredible. While the Xbox 360 had a very good launch lineup, nothing at the time (or really in hindsight) made you have to buy the console immediately. Oblivion changed that. You had to get a 360. You had to see <em>this</em>. And the gameplay lived up to the graphics. Oblivion packed dozens of hours of open-world medieval-fantasy role-playing, spanning many memorable quests and locations. It was a generation-defining moment.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. BioShock</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/bioshock-1763562150169.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before BioShock, stories were mostly secondary in first-person shooters. Sure, there was Halo, but that was the (wonderful) exception to the rule. BioShock – the brainchild of Ken Levine, creator of the emergent-gameplay classic System Shock 2 – had the depth of a great book, the plot twist of a memorable movie, and the gameplay to match the very best of any action game on the market. It was set in a failed undersea utopia – the city of Rapture – where visionary Andrew Ryan’s dream turned into a nightmare. As players discovered Rapture, they found it overrun with creepy monsters as well as curious Little Sisters and their drill-armed, divesuit-wearing protectors, the Big Daddies. It’s not hyperbole to say that BioShock elevated video game storytelling, and the fact that it was initially released as an Xbox 360 exclusive only helped further define the second Xbox as a must-have entertainment delivery box for your living room.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Fable 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/fable2-1763562359554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wouldn’t be fair to say that Fable 2 was the Xbox 360’s Zelda, it was a large-scale action-adventure RPG with charm for days and a unique consequence system that would change your character’s physical appearance based on how good – or evil – you chose to be. Fable 2, for the most part, delivered on the remaining promises made by renowned designer Peter Molyneux’s first attempt on the original Xbox. No, you couldn’t plant a seed and watch it grow into a tree, but you could wander the world of Albion with your trusty dog at your side, battling Hobbes, leveling up by actually doing jobs, and building relationships – yes, even romantic ones – with townsfolk. Player choice was at the heart of Fable 2, making it yet another fantastic and unforgettable role-playing game for an Xbox platform that, until the 360 came around (see what I did there?), was known primarily as a first-person shooter box. There had never been and still hasn’t been anything quite like Fable, and the series was at its best with Fable 2, its first Xbox 360 entry. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Grand Theft Auto 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gta4-1763562178945.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To say that the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 4’s release was a big f’n deal would be a colossal understatement. The biggest franchise on Earth was going next-gen, with a brand-new game engine and the power of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 to allow for more open-world possibilities than ever before. And while the previous 3D games had all debuted as PlayStation exclusives, GTA 4 would ship day-and-date on Xbox 360. But Microsoft wanted more than that. So they paid through the nose for timed exclusivity on both of GTA 4’s brilliant expansion packs: The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. Then-Xbox boss Peter Moore even announced this monumental get by repeating his Halo 2 release date trick, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a “tattoo” of the Grand Theft Auto 4 logo. Suddenly, the Xbox 360 was the best place to play the first next-gen GTA game, and both expansions were so good that I can’t imagine anyone – be it Microsoft writing the check or players picking up the 360 version of the game – regretted their choice.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/cod4-1763562216579.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shout-out to Call of Duty 2, which was a day-one launch title for the Xbox 360 and truly started Call of Duty’s ascent to becoming the biggest non-Grand Theft Auto video game franchise in the world, but Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the one that really sent the series into the stratosphere. It almost seems silly to say now, but before Modern Warfare, Call of Duty had only ever been a first-person shooter set in World War II. Infinity Ward not only jumped the timeline forward, but everything else, too. The stellar single-player campaign was full of shocking moments, while the multiplayer built on top of the fast time-to-kill the franchise was already known for and paired with some truly memorable maps to make it a must-play. That this hit just after the juggernaut known as Halo 3 – combined with the effortlessness of connecting with your friends on Xbox Live – cemented the Xbox 360 as the place to play multiplayer shooters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mass Effect</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/masseffect-1763562446751.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect promised players a true space opera – a trilogy of games where your choices would affect your relationships with other characters and lead to your own unique outcomes and endings. Your character would import into the subsequent games in the promised trilogy, and in the end it would be unlike any role-playing game you’d ever laid your hands on. And the first Mass Effect – an absolutely visually stunning Unreal Engine-powered epic from the RPG kings at BioWare – delivered on its end of the bargain. The Mass Effect universe felt lived-in, with myriad alien species all interacting with each other at the Citadel, a galactic hub at the virtual center of the universe. You played as a male or female Commander Shepard, a human who becomes the first of their species to be welcomed into the ranks of the Spectres, a group of space sheriffs given incredible power and leeway to protect the galaxy. No one had ever seen anything like Mass Effect before, and the fact that it came from the same development team that gave us the original-Xbox-exclusive Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, meant that Xbox truly had some of the world’s most talented RPG developers on its side.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Gears of War</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gears-1763562246425.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You know a game is a big deal when its developers can ask Microsoft to double the amount of RAM in the Xbox 360 before the console makes it to market – and Microsoft says yes. Gears of War was perhaps the best-looking action game anyone had ever seen when it was released just 11 months into the Xbox 360’s lifespan, but it had incredibly weighty third-person cover-based gameplay to match its stunning looks. Gears of War dropped us onto the planet Sera, into the middle of a war between humans and the Locust, an underground-dwelling alien race hellbent on obliterating humanity. Gears of War is a war story, and while its Active Reload system, delightfully vicious chainsaw finishing moves with the Lancer rifle, and engrossing team-based multiplayer were all top-shelf, it’s arguably its empathetic characters that secured its place in gamers’ hearts. Marcus, Dom, Baird, and Cole – Delta Squad – really felt like brothers, and we became emotionally invested in their wartime journey. It’s no wonder Microsoft later bought the franchise for $2 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Halo 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/halo3-1763562264089.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 may not have had a new Halo game on day one, but as the rest of this list has shown, it didn’t need it. Still, when the day finally came in September of 2007 for the hugely anticipated Halo 3 to drop – nearly two years into the new Xbox’s life – it couldn’t have been a bigger deal. The original Xbox’s Halo 2 had infamously ended on a cliffhanger, and Halo 3 was built to resolve it – throwing plenty more hardware horsepower at Master Chief in the process. Story-wise it stuck the landing this time, giving players a satisfying conclusion that closed the book on Bungie’s trilogy, but not before Chief told us, “Wake me, when you need me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer picked up where Halo 2 left off, augmenting the best online multiplayer infrastructure with Forge, a new level-editing tool that let players build their own maps. In hindsight, this is where Halo peaked in terms of success, popularity, cultural relevance and impact, as Call of Duty took its place at the top of the first-person shooter ladder after the release of the aforementioned Call of Duty 4. But we finished the fight, and the Xbox 360 eliminated any remaining doubt as to its dominance in the games industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are our picks for the 20 games that defined the Xbox 360.

              <p>Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/">just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>40-Hour Battery Life Outlasts Every Competitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on</strong>, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless audio via USB-C</strong> (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can’t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference.</p>



<p>This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment</strong> and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio with <strong>dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience</strong>. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you.</p>



<p>Improved compatibility<strong> works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems</strong>. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features.</p>
<p>On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can’t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries.</p>
<p>For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don’t offer near the same level of battery life.</p>

              <p><strong>Amazon saves its best Black Friday deals for Prime members</strong>, and this portable monitor shows why the membership pays for itself, quite literally. Non-subscribers see regular pricing, while Prime members unlock exclusive discounts that slash products down to absurd lows. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor handles both <strong>gaming and productivity with a Full HD IPS display</strong> that travels anywhere your laptop goes. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">dropped this to $66 for Black Friday, down from $99, but only Prime members access this record low pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Quality Visuals Anywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display gives 1920×1080 resolution for sharp text and clear images throughout the 15.6-inch display</strong> panel. The IPS technology assures accurate colors and consistent brightness from any viewing angle of up to 178 degrees. You see the same image quality whether you look straight on or from the side, which counts if you do group work or adjustable setups. HDR technology enhances contrast between bright and dark areas, making games and movies look more dynamic. The display reduces blue light radiation and eliminates flickering to protect your eyes against fatigue during extended viewing.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C connectivity enables single-cable connections</strong> that handle video signal and power delivery in tandem on compatible devices. You plug in one cable to laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, and the monitor works immediately without external power. The two USB-C ports make way for different device connections and cable routing preferences. Mini-HDMI input accommodates devices lacking USB-C video output, ensuring compatibility with older laptops, gaming consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The<strong> ultra-slim profile of 0.3 inches and a weight of 1.7 pounds</strong>&nbsp;make this portable, rather than just technically portable. You slip this into a laptop bag beside your computer without adding any noticeable bulk or weight. The slim build fits in the same compartments as tablets or thin ultrabooks do. This kind of portability changes the way you think about workspace setup, as bringing a second monitor along becomes simple.</p>



<p>The <strong>included smart cover protects the screen</strong> during transport and converts into an adjustable stand for desktop use. Being budget-friendly, the exterior uses PU leather that resists scratches and feels premium. Two grooves in the bottom of the cover provide different viewing angles for comfort with multiple setups. The magnetic frameless design of this keeps the cover attached securely without adding bulk or interfering with the display.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with gaming consoles</strong> extends the monitor’s usability beyond laptop productivity. You hook up a Playstation 4, Xbox, or Switch directly to this for portable big-screen gaming anywhere. Hotel rooms, guest bedrooms, or any space with a power outlet becomes a gaming station. The native 1080p resolution of the console output is matched and color accuracy from the IPS panel is better than many hotel TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity to your smartphone transforms the monitor into a desktop experience</strong> for your mobile device. You will connect compatible phones via USB-C and expand your mobile workspace into a proper screen size. This feature works great for presentations, video watching, or using mobile apps on larger displays. You need no apps or drivers for this setup; it works immediately via plug-and-play functionality.</p>
<p>Built-in dual speakers provide audio without requiring external speakers or headphones. The sound quality handles video calls, casual entertainment, and basic gaming adequately. <strong>A 3.5mm audio jack</strong> houses headphones or external speakers when you need better audio quality. The speakers add in convenience for quick setups where carrying additional audio equipment isn’t practical.</p>
<p>At $66 for Prime members, you’re getting a full-featured portable monitor with an IPS panel, smart cover, and multi-device compatibility for 34% off. Competing portable monitors with similar specs sell for $100-150 without the included accessories.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has had a disappointing launch in Europe, with sales reportedly down 63 percent compared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s bumper debut week.</p>
<p>We already knew something was up when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-wake-of-battlefield-6-and-arc-radiers-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffered-a-much-smaller-launch-than-previous-cod-games">Activision's own response felt a little more muted than previous years</a>, but according to estimates from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business</a> and data from <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD</a>, sales are also down by "more than" 50 percent when compared to its predecessor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, Black Ops 7 is available for no extra charge on Xbox and PC Game Pass for those subscribing to the pricier Ultimate tier, which will undoubtedly skew sales figures. Nonetheless, with an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score</a> - the data will be grim reading for Microsoft and Activision.</p>
<p>All that said, according to GSD's data, that hasn't stopped Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from being Europe's biggest-selling game this week, both by unit sales and revenue.</p>
<p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars. "I'm just not convinced those changes bode well for the health of the series."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-patch-curbs-one-of-the-biggest-zombies-grinds-fixes-crashes-across-all-modes">The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 patch</a> has brought a handful of fixes for the sci-fi FPS, including substantial adjustments to various camo challenges that have been proving troublesome for the cosmetically-minded player base. This includes a few weapon camos in Zombies, which were three times harder to unlock than intended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a long time to become even halfway decent at <em>Forestrike</em>. The martial arts action game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252953/olija-game-review-nintendo-switch-steam-pc-ps4-xbox">from <em>Olija</em> developer Skeleton Crew</a>, has a unique twist in that it lets you see what will happen in most battles and then practice your strategy accordingly. It turns the act of combat into a type of puzzle game, but one that still requires fast reflexes and precision decision-making to be successful. And it has successfully turned me into a solid fighter — at least in the realm of a pixelated video game.</p><p>You play as a martial arts student named Yu, who, despite being relatively green, is tasked with ridding his homeland of an evil empire. To do this, you mostly travel across the landscape beating up bad guys. <em>Forestrike </em>has a roguelite structure, meaning that each time you play the levels and scenarios change slightly, and also that you’re going to lose a lot. But that losing is also inherent to the premise: This is a game about constantly learning. Along the way you’re accompanied by various martial arts masters who will teach you new techniques to aid in your quest.</p><p>Central to all of this is an ability known as foresight. In essence, this lets you preview a battle before you go in for the real thing. It’s like a practice run; you can see how things will play out and practice your strategy in advance. Battles in <em>Forestrike</em> are fast, usually lasting just a few seconds, but like a great martial arts movie, they involve a carefully orchestrated series of movements. Foresight lets you figure out exactly how you want to proceed before you’re actually in danger.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that <em>Forestrike</em> is easy. Early on, I got my ass kicked regularly. Even when you know exactly when you should dodge, or pick up a weapon, or use a slow but powerful kick, it’s still a challenge to nail it when it counts, no matter how much you train. The game also constantly throws different challenges at you; sometimes you can only use foresight a limited number of times in a battle, other times not at all.</p><p>Foresight is not a crutch to make the game less challenging, but more of a tool to sharpen your skills. It’s like tossing some warm-up shots before an actual basketball game. Those challenges help keep the game fresh even as many of the battles can be pretty similar. The same goes for its structure, which lets you regularly unlock new skills for each run and eventually meet new martial arts masters who will each teach you new techniques, giving you even more options.</p><p>Eventually, things started to click. And when you do eventually pull off a flawless run through a big group of enemies it feels <em>incredible</em>, like you’re really in a classic action movie, pulling the strings. But those few seconds of perfection involve a whole lot of practice.</p><p><sub>Forestrike <em>is available now on Steam, and is “coming soon” to the Nintendo Switch.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826331/forestrike-review-nintendo-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2-2000646455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2.1361626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the <em>Ultra</em> series and hasn’t looked back since. The <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands</strong>&nbsp;and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can’t match.</p>
<p>Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it’s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/"> just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple’s most rugged wearable</a>. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Titanium Construction Survives Everything You Throw at It</h2>
<p>A <strong>49mm case made of titanium</strong> resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn’t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. <strong>Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters</strong>, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports.</p>
<p>The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The <strong>Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness</strong>, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail.</p>



<p>Precision<strong> dual-frequency GPS</strong> delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over.</p>
<p>The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you’re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining.</p>



<p><strong>Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind</strong> while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures.</p>
<p>That means <strong>battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active</strong>, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general.</p>
<p>Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much.</p>
<p>At $599, you’re getting Apple’s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro.1361614/</guid>

              <p>MacBook Pro models start at $1,599 which puts Apple’s professional laptops out of reach for many buyers who want quality computing without spending a fortune. The MacBook Air with M4 chip delivers similar performance for everyday tasks at literally half the cost of its Pro sibling.</p>
<p>Apple never discounts products on their own website or in Apple Stores, and keeps strict pricing that forces deal hunters toward third-party retailers. Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air (256GB model) to $749 for Black Friday, down from $999</a>, and marks a record low that <strong>already moved over 10,000 units this month</strong>. This 25% discount represents the kind of Apple savings you simply won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Performance in Air Package</h2>
<p>Housing the most recent Apple silicon architecture,<strong> the M4 processor in the MacBook Air unleashes performance</strong> that increasingly blurs the line separating Air and Pro notebooks. The chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, photo manipulation, and software development without the thermal throttling that plagued Intel MacBooks. The<strong> unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU can share the same 16GB pool efficiently</strong>, and sidestep the bottlenecks traditional systems experience. This level of performance handles professional workflows smoothly, which the previous generations of Air just couldn’t manage well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> comes built into this M4 MacBook, bringing AI capabilities directly into the operating system. The system helps with writing tasks, image generation, and intelligent assistance without requiring cloud processing for many features. The M4’s Neural Engine processes AI workloads locally and keeps your data private while delivering fast results.</p>



<p>It features a<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and sharp text</strong> for extended work sessions comfortable. This display features P3 wide color gamut for accurate color reproduction that photographers and designers require. This <strong>system comes with 500 nits of brightness</strong> for clear visibility in bright environments without struggling to see content. Bezels remain thin from all sides to retain maximum screen space within the compact chassis.</p>



<p>It’s a 12MP <em>Center Stage</em> camera that provides clear video calls with a<strong>utomatic framing that keeps you centered as you move</strong>. The camera tracks your position and adjusts the frame with optimal composition during video conferencing. That will work across FaceTime, Zoom, and other video applications without manually having to change anything.</p>
<p>Fanless design means <strong>this MacBook runs in complete silence, no matter the workload</strong>. The M4 chip creates such minimal heat that passive cooling takes over the thermal management without mechanical movement. You work in quiet environments such as libraries or late-night sessions without disturbing anyone with the fan noise. This silence is a real advantage compared to Pro models that immediately fire up their fans when doing resource-intensive work.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of typical mixed use</strong>. You can go through a whole day without searching for outlets or managing power settings. This is due to the M4 chip architecture, which brings performance with power-sipping efficiency.</p>
<p>We have Apple’s latest MacBook with an M4 chip and 16GB RAM for $749, which is a straight 25% discount off the original price and makes it half as expensive as entry-level models of the MacBook Pro. For Black Friday, this sale makes current-generation Apple Silicon accessible without compromise or having to settle for older models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-2000646445</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low.1361611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage speed dictates how fast your entire computer feels, from boot times to application launches to game loading. The<strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</strong> is the cutting edge of SSD technology and harnesses <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong> to deliver double the read speeds of previous generation drives.</p>
<p>This kind of performance transforms workflows for gamers, content creators and even professionals running AI workloads that require instant data access. Amazon slashes prices on all three capacities: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 1TB dropped from $199 to $134</a>, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">2TB dropped from $279 to $219</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 4TB dropped from $469 to $369</a>. That means <strong>every capacity hits record low pricing</strong> that makes next-generation storage genuinely accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>14,700 MB/s Read Speed Removes Every Bottleneck</h2>
<p>The resulting sequential <strong>read speed of 14,700 MB/s nearly doubles what the PCIe 4.0 drives</strong> offer and revolutionizes how fast data navigates your system. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch in real-time and large file transfers take place faster than it can process what’s going on. Games with DirectStorage support can load levels in moments rather than the loading screens that define current gaming experiences. What’s more, it actually <strong>far exceeds what most users can currently saturate</strong>&nbsp;which truly means the drive will stay relevant as software catches up to the hardware capability.</p>
<p>The <strong>sequential write speeds match the impressive read performance</strong>, handling large file creation and modifications without slowdowns like cheaper drives experience. To video editors working with 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains responsive, while exports complete in a fraction of the time. For content creators moving huge project files around between drives, transfers finish almost instantly.</p>



<p>The PCIe 5.0 x4 interface leverages four lanes of the latest PCIe standard to achieve these speeds on a compatible motherboard. Intel 13th and 14th generation platforms, along with AMD Ryzen 7000 series, support PCIe 5.0 natively. The M.2 2280 form factor fits standard slots without adapters or special mounting requirements. Older PCIe 4.0 systems run this drive at reduced speeds, still delivering excellent performance while leaving upgrade headroom when you eventually update your platform.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung’s thermal solution is also great and</strong> manages the heat generated by high-speed operation. Included in both the controller and NAND packages are heat spreaders for dissipating thermal energy during sustained transfers. Additional thermal management is provided by systems with dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions.</p>
<p>With this drive,<strong> AI computing workloads benefit considerably from its speed characteristics</strong>. Machine learning models load their training data much faster, and a lesser time is spent waiting for storage. Local AI inference runs more responsively when the models stream from the high-speed storage. In fact, the specifications target AI computing aside from gaming and professional workstations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With the Tales series Remaster Project, Bandai Namco is bringing back older entries in the series to modern consoles and PC, allowing more users to enjoy some solid JRPGs such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition/">Tales of Vesperia</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-the-power-of-friendship-enhanced-and-improved/">Tales of Graces f</a>, whose action-oriented combat systems continue to be among the best in the genre.</p>



<p>Series producer Yusuke Tomizawa recently confirmed that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> more remasters are planned</a>, shortly before the release of Tales of Xillia Remastered last month. He promised the next announcement would follow the October 2025 release. That promised announcement, Tales of Berseria Remastered for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch, has now arrived, to the disappointment of many fans, myself included.</p>



<p>As you may have noticed if you visit Wccftech daily, I didn't cover the announcement earlier this week, despite being a massive fan of the series. I was so disappointed by it that I didn't want my negative feelings to show in my report, because <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria is objectively one of the best entries in the series</a> and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, having played it for over 200 hours across the Japanese PlayStation 4 release and the global Steam release.</p>



<p>The game definitely deserves these new quality of life updates, including early access to the Grade Shop, destination icons, and the ability to toggle encounters. However, since the original released just in 2016 and is easily playable on other modern systems, a simple Nintendo Switch port would have served the same purpose.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Still, there are a few other Tales games that I wish Bandai Namco would have remastered before Tales of Berseria, to help the franchise stay relevant during its prolonged hiatus since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a> in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-hearts-r">Tales of Hearts R</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Hearts R doesn't deserve to remain stuck on PlayStation Vita</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although Tales of Hearts R was launched in 2014, only two years before Tales of Berseria, the game has a major issue that its successor does not: availability. Having been released exclusively on the PlayStation Vita, one of Sony's less successful gaming systems, very few players had the opportunity to experience Kor Meteor and his friends' journey across the world of Organica. With the very real possibility that the Vita digital store may eventually go offline, the game's access could become even more limited.</p>



<p>It would be a massive shame if Tales of Hearts R never gets remastered. Not only are the story and characters quite enjoyable, tied together by a mineral-based theme that suits the world rather well, but the combat system is, to date, one of the best 3D renditions of the series' Linear Motion Battle System, granting players the chance of performing some cool, intricate combos without being overly broken with the Chase Link system. Even better, Tales of Hearts R solved the recurring issue of unbalanced boss fights by introducing a combo-breaking mechanic for all enemies, which can be countered by the players with a timed button press, allowing expert players to keep up the pressure. All this, combined with the unique fighting styles of all playable characters, makes Tales of Hearts R a joy to play for action game fans.</p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss">Tales of the Abyss</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>While Tales of the Abyss would deserve a remake in my opinion, a remaster would be very welcome</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tales of the Abyss, much like Tales of Hearts R, has an availability issue that's made even worse by the fact that neither the original PS2 release nor the Nintendo 3DS ports are available for purchase digitally, forcing players to track down physical copies of the game, which can be both costly and challenging, or rely on emulation. This, coupled with the great story and characters and its enduring popularity among fans, would have made a remaster of the game far more preferable than Tales of Berseria Remastered (though something could already be brewing, judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.facebook.com/tales/posts/pfbid0AgTrWaitqVq48nF11pma2sKktjLkiUc462WG4hoTEqyto7fFg7iJPoJX4T9XeSZUl">a new image Bandai Namco shared on social media</a>).</p>



<p>While a remaster would quickly bring one of the series' best entries to a wider audience, I would personally prefer a full remake. Luke's compelling story and charming companions are exceptional, but some gameplay elements feel a little dated. Specifically, the combat system feels restrictive due to its reliance on the old Artes trees, forcing players to exploit glitches to get creative. Additionally, the overtuned Free Run mechanics make it too easy to negate powerful enemy attacks.</p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-rebirth">Tales of Rebirth</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Rebirth is a challenging game that takes a slightly different direction from the rest of the series in terms of combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Tales of Hearts R and Tales of the Abyss have been released in the West at some point, a few older entries in the series haven't, at least not officially. Among them is Tales of Rebirth, which is not only the last all-original mainline 2D entry in the series, but an excellent game in its own right that was made<a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/"> fully playable in English for the first time only last year.</a></p>



<p>While Veigue's story can be hit-and-miss (and involuntarily hilarious) sometimes, the game's battle system is one of the most articulate combat systems in the history of the series, featuring some very interesting mechanics such as battlefields being divided in three different planes instead of one and the Rage mechanics which can be manipulated on the fly to improve either offensive and defensive capabilities, making for a very dynamic system that makes battles engaging for its entire duration. The ability to enhance Artes with unique skills is the cherry on top of a combat system that is far from being the flashiest in the series, but is one of the most interesting nonetheless, attempting and succeeding at addressing the button-mashing criticism sometimes addressed to the series as a whole.</p>

<p>With Tales of Xillia Remastered already having been released, remastering Tales of Xillia 2 next would have been a given. Not only is the game already localized, it uses the same engine as its predecessor, and it's generally, in my opinion, a much better game, successfully addressing many of its criticisms, such as the empty fields that replaced a classic world map, pacing, and lack of optional content.</p>



<p>Although it recycles much of Tales of Xillia's locations, Tales of Xillia 2 succeeds at making the second venture through the united world of Rieze Maxia and Elympyos engaging with a very personal story, which is elevated by some of the dark implications of Ludger's alternate realities eradication. Things do get a little confusing at times, as it usually happens when multiple dimensions are involved, but ultimately, Tales of Xillia 2's story and main characters, amazing combat system, and stellar soundtrack make it a game worth experiencing. Hopefully, it won't take long for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> already confirmed remaster to come out.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-destiny-director-s-cut">Tales of Destiny Director's Cut</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Destiny Director's Cut is still today the best entry in the Tales series that most fans in the West haven't played</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While I haven't purposelly ranked which Tales game I would have liked to see remastered before Tales of Berseria on purpose since I would love to see all of them on modern consoles and PC, if I only had to chose one, it would be Tales of Destiny Director's Cut, and not only because the original PSX release was the first entry in the series I played, or because I have played the game for close to 500 hours back in the day when I had all the time in the world and loved every second of it.</p>



<p>Seventeen years after its release, the remake of the second entry in the series continues to be, in my opinion, the best Tales game ever released. Everything, from the story, which does a great job of making Stahn's journey both exciting and epic, to the charming cast of characters and gameplay, remains unmatched in the series to this day.</p>



<p>However, if I were to pick only one reason to remaster the game, it would be its combat system. Marking the debut of the Chain Capacity system which has been iterated upon by future entries in the series, the Tales of Destiny Director's Cut rendition of the franchise's Linear Motion Battle System is, simply put, amazing, combining deep strategic thinking with the Weakness system that increases damage when hitting the enemy with an element they are week to, with almost complete combo freedom, doing away with the Artes tree system employed by past games to deliver an extremely deep experience with tons of tech that would even put some traditional fighting games to shame.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">All of the Tales of Destiny Director's Cut mechanics come together really well to deliver the best combat system in the series, as showcased in the combo video above by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ssrai">donguri900</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even if we were to ignore the game's quality, remastering Tales of Destiny Director's Cut in the near future would be the best way to get the series out of the slump it has fallen into following the release of Tales of Arise. Although there are surely some technical challenges, such as source code issues and localizing the game in English for the first time, remastering the game ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series would give Western players what feels like a brand-new, excellent title that could revitalize a series that has been stuck on remasters for far too long. And with so many 2D titles finding success nowadays, there's really no reason not to make the game's beautifully detailed sprites shine at higher resolutions.</p>



<p>These are the Tales games I would have loved to see getting the remaster treatment before Tales of Berseria, but there are many other entries in the series still stuck on old consoles. Do you agree with my list, or would you like to see any other entry in the series getting remastered? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-bulky-smartwatches-oura-ring-4-is-not-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000646440</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

I don't usually go in for 'relic' effects on anything, but this looked a bit special. It felt artful and novel in a market where neon gamer gear dominates, screaming for attention, and 'cheapening' otherwise decent equipment. The Xbox face button layout, though, meant it wasn't specifically relevant to Switch owners.</p>
<p>Fast-forward several months, and there's <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/products/550-spyder-crush-controller-limited-edition-with-k-silver-tmr-joysticks">a new model</a> bearing Nintendo's classic button layout. Retailing for $79.99, this is the firm's familiar Crush pad but with '50s automotive stylings - specifically, it's celebrating the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_550">Porsche 550 Spyder</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gzoihr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There's no official licensing on this tribute, but the finish is beautiful, if you're into that sort of thing. The red light strip along the bottom edge (you can change the colour - more on that later) looks like a tail light, while the decals and details across the face, plus the silver paint job and the 'grille', faux-number plate, and red strips on the rear, give the feel of a quality piece of retro memorabilia. The burgundy trim of the D-pad and the shoulder buttons add to the classy, retro stylings, too.</p>

<p>Opinion among Team NL is divided — you'll need to be a classic car connoisseur or have a thing for mechanical engineering and retro design — but I love the look and feel. It's a niche aesthetic and the pad won't suit every gaming purpose, but there's a luxuriousness to the finish and the chrome accents that gets my motor running. You feel like you should be playing with leather driving gloves when you're handling this thing (and maybe I did).</p>
<p>In the hands, gloved or otherwise, this Crush pad feels like an old-school Xbox 360 controller, but weightier, and definitely glossier. The metal of the default sticks is just the beginning, and the slickness of the bodywork is probably a dealbreaker if you main games that give you sweaty palms.</p>
<p>Fingerprints were my immediate concern on taking the pad from its black and white case and removing the little foam collars around the sticks, but surprisingly, I haven't found them an issue. I assumed I'd need a microfiber cloth after every session, but it's been fine sitting on the side over the past couple of weeks, despite the dust on my TV shelf and my sticky gamer paws.</p>

<p>A braided USB-A to C cable is included for charging (the claimed 30-hour life feels accurate, although that'll depend on your lighting intensity), plus a dongle for 2.4G wireless connection and plastic/rubber sticks if you want to swap out the zinc alloy pair.</p>
<p>And honestly? If you're into your online shooters or just want to be competitive in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, you'll want to switch the stick covers; channel-hopping in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> was a dream, a tense shootout in Springfield less so. I had no issue racing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> or unleashing ninja skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, but chromed metal just doesn't offer enough grip for split-second, precision inputs.</p>
<p>The sticks themselves are the TMR variety, so power efficient and offering commensurate performance and protection against drift to Hall Effect. Obviously, it'll take a year or two of use to thoroughly test their resilience, but there's nothing to suggest they'll start wandering. They feel robust and responsive.</p>
<p>Changing the sticks involves removing the magnetic faceplate, which can be tricky if you don't have decent nails, but gripping the front housing up around the shoulder buttons while pressing down on the sticks with your thumbs will eventually prise the cover away. Swap out the metal ones, clip the caps into the plastic domes, pop the cover back on, and you're away.</p>

<p>PB sells other faceplates, although it would be weird to buy one of these and then ruin the aesthetic with a clear orange cover. Also worth noting is that the carry case's foam insert holds the two-part plastic sticks only, so you'll need to store the metal ones safely somewhere else.</p>
<p>Removing the chrome ones feels like sacrilege, though, like you've whacked some cheap rims on a vintage Jag. It functions well, with gyro controls, some very nice rumble (the growl it makes when it connects to the console feels, brilliantly, like a revving engine), and pleasingly springy analogue triggers. The D-pad felt fine for a blast through some NSO classics, and the whole controller has a premium-feeling heft to it.</p>
<p>Even the RGB lighting feels somehow sophisticated here. Holding down the 'T' (turbo) button and moving the left stick lets you pick the exact colour of the light strip, while the right stick changes the face and central Home buttons. You can tweak the intensity of the LEDs, too, and I appreciated that it's all there and selectable via the pad itself, no external software needed. You can't buy a lightbulb these days without downloading a bloody app.</p>

<p>Face button lighting presets are selectable, as well: Super Famicom-style is the default, but you've also got PlayStation blue with the customary hues of Sony's shapes, or Xbox green and corresponding button colours. There's also a Dreamcast-style option - at least I think that's what the orange home button and this colour layout are referencing. Obviously, the Nintendo ABYX labelling remains, but it's a neat nod to other platforms.</p>
<p>No clicky microswitches is a big plus, personally; all the face buttons feel nicely responsive without the irritating, cheap-sounding click that makes playing in a quiet space irritating. Toggling the switch on the top edge changes from 'S' (Switch) to 'X' (XInput), and everything functioned exactly as you'd expect when testing with Steam using the included dongle (or wired if you prefer) and iOS over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>While you get added turbo options via the aforementioned button, you don't get NFC reader for amiibo or a 'C' button for easy Switch 2 GameChat access. There's no headphone jack, either, so headset gamers should look elsewhere, and you don't get any fancy back buttons, either.</p>
<p>Another minor quirk is that '-' and '+' here are in the position of the Home and Capture buttons on Nintendo's controller, so prepare for some accidental screenshots at first. Also, you can't wake your Switch 2 up with this - not an issue for me as I always turn it on via the console, but some people really like the convenience of grabbing the pad down the side of the sofa and powering on.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of pad you'll leave jammed down the side of the sofa, though. For $80, there are functions missing that you might hope to have. If you only get one controller for Switch 2, look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's own option</a> or something from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8Bitdo</a>. You're really paying for the <em>style</em> here. The Crush 550 needs pairing with a high-backed, leather-studded chair and a glass of Margaux while enjoying a visual novel or a light puzzler. It's <em>not</em> what you want if you're in the midst of a nailbiting deathmatch, perspiring between frantic frags and Dorito downtime. You wouldn't want to rag this into the ground with twitch shooters.</p>

<p>It really depends what kind of gamer you are, then. I find this a pleasure to play with, and I'll be using it whenever a game doesn't demand more performance than it can manage. A classic car is a perfect comparison; this is a fair-weather pad, a beautiful Sunday driver you take out only when conditions allow. If you're in the market for something for the weekend and value-for-money is less important than sophistication, this will look and feel great in your showroom.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has announced "Teammates", an "AI experiment to change the game" and "deepen the player experience".</p>
<p>The developer/publisher said the project is "more than just talk" and will add "depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates" as you play a first-person shooter.</p>
<p>The reveal comes after Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told investors yesterday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">generative AI has been integrated across the entire company</a>, calling it a "revolution" for video games as big as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, Teammates is an experimental research project, albeit a playable one," Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps">explained</a>. "Built around the mechanics of a first-person shooter, players take on the role of a member of the resistance in a dystopian future, tasked with moving through an enemy base to locate five missing members of their team.</p><p>"In the short playable level, players must recover the final memories of those who were sent in previously to discover their fates, while fending off squads of enemies along their path. Besides the AI voice assistant – Jaspar – the player is accompanied by two NPC squad members – Pablo and Sofia – also featuring the new advanced capabilities."</p>
<p>AI assistant Jaspar can highlight enemies or objects, provide story and lore details, alter game settings "on the fly", or even pause the game, all through simple and natural vocal instructions.</p>
<p>"But more than this, he is a dynamic and responsive character within the story," the company added. "The underlying systems can process the information available within the Teammates experiment’s environment, and contextual cues, interpreting and adapting to the player’s vocal input and actions."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates.

<p>You can also directly command - or "chat with" - your NPC teammates, Sofia and Pablo.</p>
<p>"Our early experiments showed players were quickly connecting with the AI-driven NPCs and the voice assistant concept," director of gameplay GenAI Xavier Manzanares added.</p>
<p>"Jaspar was helping players when they got lost or weren’t sure what to do, he could access menus and settings, tell players more about the world and the story. We really started to like Jaspar and saw how a system like this could be interesting for many different kinds of games."</p><p>“This technology opens doors to new, personalised experiences,” added data &amp; AI director Rémi Labory. “Player input shapes character reactions in real time, something traditional development can’t achieve. We’re also delivering a full pipeline, with the experience taking players from onboarding to debrief, which is a first.”</p>
<p>The team said it was "aware of the criticisms around AI in games", but insisted the goal "is not to replace creatives, but rather to find ways to enhance it by combining the strengths of the technology and the human creativity and ingenuity that are crucial to making games".</p>
<p>"At first, I had the same concerns as many others," explained narrative director Virginie Mosser. "But I discovered that it’s the exact opposite of removing the human from the process. I still write the story and character personalities, but instead of fixed lines, we create these kinds of fences that let NPCs improvise within the world but stay within the boundaries of the lore and motivations we have given them. They can improvise, but we still set the rules and direct the story and characters."</p>
<p>Ubisoft finished by saying that "Teammates" has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. It will continue to test and develop the technology, "building the tools and gathering vital reactions and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand the systems they have built, all with a philosophy of human creativity, ingenuity, and curiosity at the heart of their work".</p>
<p>This news follows the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft later confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>
