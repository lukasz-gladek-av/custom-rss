		<p>There are a lot of Silent Hill things going on at the moment, so you may have forgotten that a sequel to 2006’s Silent Hill film is going to be released this year*. The movie makers have also forgotten something, mainly that there has already been a sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-revelations-3d/">2012’s Silent Hill: Revelations.</a></p>
<p>This new sequel is doing a <em>“James Cameron / Terminator”</em> thing as the 2006 movie director, Christopher Gans, is returning and pretending the 2012 movie does not exist. Return to Silent Hill is based on Silent Hill 2 and stars Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson. It also features <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9043183/?ref_=tt_cst_t_5">Pearse Egan</a> as Eddie Dombrowski, who featured in an indie film for which I wrote the dance music. Small world innit?</p>


<p>Pyramid Head, or “Red Pyramid” as he is known in the film despite not being red, can be seen at the end of the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jas34nN2IKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Return to Silent Hill brings the iconic horror franchise back to the screen. When James receives a mysterious letter from his lost love Mary, he is drawn to Silent Hill—a once-familiar town now consumed by darkness. As he searches for her, James faces monstrous creatures and unravels a terrifying truth that will push him to the edge of his sanity.”</p>

<p>I quit enjoyed both of the previous Silent Hill movies, they certainly stuck more to the themes of the games than all the Resident Evil movies did.</p>
<p><em>*Just to confuse things the trailer is dated for 2025, but other sources say the film will be out in January 2026.</em></p>

<p>Developer and publisher Tribute Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>) has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a> on Nintendo Switch, confirming the addition of two new playable characters.</p>
<p>So who might these playable characters be? Surely they're good guys like Wallace Wells or Knives Chau, right? Wrong. Say hello to Lucas Lee and Roxie Richter, two of Ramona Flowers' evil exes and minor antagonists from the original comic series.</p>
<p>With Toronto overrun with gangs, members of the band Sex Bob-Omb have been kidnapped, forcing Scott and Ramona to join forces with her former foes, each of which bring their own unique fighting style to the fray. Scott Pilgrim EX displays the same exceptional animation that Tribute Games is known for, while staying true to the original Ubisoft game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/scott_pilgrim_vs_the_world_the_game_-_complete_edition">Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</a>. Honestly, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Step into the shoes of seven fan-favorite fighters, each with their own distinct combat style.</p>
<p>- Venture out on epic quests and battle new enemies and bosses across interconnected levels in a new story by series creator Bryan Lee O’Malley that will appeal to longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>- Master creative combos, wield wacky weapons, use your surroundings to your advantage and conquer the chaos!</p>
<p>- Spend your hard-earned coins to customize your fighter! Equip special items and upgrade your stats to create a unique build for every playthrough!</p>
<p>- Known for their explosive blend of 8-bit energy and hyper-melodic rock, the band returns to their roots with all new music crafted for this Toronto-hopping adventure.</p>
<p>- Join forces with up to three friends, locally or online, with easy drop-in/drop-out co-op. Battle solo or hit the streets together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Pilgrim EX is currently scheduled to launch on the Switch in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-rebuilds-ship-building/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-voyagers-rebuilds-ship-building-in-massive-6-0-update.1281888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hello Games has just dropped another massive, and of course, free, update for No Man's Sky with the release of its Voyagers update, and version 6.0 of the game that first launched on PC and PS4 all the way back in 2016.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of this new update is how Hello Games has rebuilt the way ship building works in the game, as you can now build completely custom ships that you can walk around in, decorate how you like, filling each of the various rooms with your friends and fellow explorers, and jump out into space from to enjoy the vastness of the universe if you find yourself in a particularly pretty part of space.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Man's Sky Voyagers Trailer (Update 6.0)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>After recently releasing No Man's Sky on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massively-improved-switch-2-version-lets-you-be-a-towns-mayor/">Nintendo Switch 2,</a> Hello Games founder Sean Murray and the rest of the studio have made it clear they're seemingly nowhere done with updates for the game, with Voyagers now No Man's Sky's 39th named update since its historic launch. "<em></em><em>I can’t believe it’s been just over nine years since No Man’s Sky first launched</em>," Murray said in a press release. Frankly, considering how different, yet similar, the game looks, neither can we.</p>



<p>Murray continues by detailing some of what's possible with Voyagers and how players can approach ship building in this new update. "<em>We call them Corvettes, huge ships with hulls, wings, landing gear, cockpits, engine parts, thrusters and more - arranged to your own unique sci-fi design,"</em> he says. "<em>These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters. It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Adding bigger weapons to your Corvette increases your firepower. Add sleeping quarters and a mission radar, and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready to adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team. Or just a window… and suddenly there are these special moments, watching as the universe flies by outside at warp speed.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Man's Sky Voyagers Update - Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdkt2rDKnAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>He also reminds players, just in case they've forgotten, that all the tech Hello Games is building for No Man's Sky is also being built for <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/">Light No Fire,</a> the next ambitious project from the studio that, instead of giving you a whole universe to explore, will charge you with exploring one large, Earth-sized, detailed planet. It's a whole new kind of challenge, and it is one of the most anticipated titles in the video game landscape.</p>



<p>"<em>I can’t believe that in the past 12 months we released Worlds Part I, Worlds Part II, and Voyagers - all huge changes to this game we care about so much</em>," Murray added. "<em>Many thanks for any support you continue to provide our little game. It really helps us continue to do what we do.</em>"</p>



<p>Voyagers is now available for No Man's Sky players on all platforms.</p>

Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has gone on to sell more than </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><span>3.3 million copies</span></a><span> since its launch in April, and is a frontrunner as we head into Game of the Year talks in December. Naturally, Sandfall Interactive is looking to capitalize on all this by making </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>a full-blown franchise rather than a one-off, as director Guillaume Broche has hinted that it has more stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4"><span>MrMattyPlays</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>), Broche says that </span><i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>is “not the end” of the series, and that Sandfall Interactive hopes to release more games under the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>umbrella. Whether that means direct sequels to </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> or if Sandfall Interactive decides to go </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>the </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>route</span></a><span> and create an anthology of separate stories remains to be seen.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> is the franchise name,” Broche says. “</span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> franchise.”</span></p> <p><span>If a sequel is set in the same universe as </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, it’s unlikely that it would take place after the original game. Its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>branching endings</span></a><span> leave that world in two markedly different states, and neither of them screams “sequel bait.” Sandfall Interactive might explore any of the other numbered expeditions in a prequel, but we do know how all of those turned out based on the logs they left behind. There’s also the “outside world” storyline that is briefly touched on in Act 3 but never resolved. I’ll stay vague on that one to avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a lot of possibilities for the future of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is an easy contender for that coveted game of the year award, having been received incredibly well by critics and players alike. But as with any breakout success from a brand-new studio, there unfortunately comes an annoying question: What's next? Developer Sandfall Interactive is still staying mostly quiet on that front, but in a recent interview with game director Guillaume Broche, it has been at least confirmed that Expedition 33 will not be the only Clair Obscur game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to YouTuber MrMattyPlays (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>), Broche explained that "Clair Obscur is the franchise name. Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4ZEP5kjw-w4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Broche played it understandably coy here, as Expedition 33 only came out in April this year. With how long game development takes--and with Broche noting in this interview that he wants to keep the team relatively small going forward--we probably won't know what a potential sequel looks like. The game is quite notably inspired by the Final Fantasy series, which generally takes an anthological approach to its releases, so there are still questions over whether a Clair Obscur sequel would be a direct follow-up, or something new entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're yet to try out the game for yourself, and you're looking for a helping hand in figuring out if it's for you or not, then you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> for more.</p>

<p>Considering that even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-mobile-now-supports-60-fps-on-some-device/1100-6463504/" data-ref-id="1100-6463504">Fortnite on mobile is supported with 60 FPS</a>, bumping that up to 90 sounds impressive. Even in Destiny 2 for PS5 during Crucible runs, it can reach up to 120fps, but PvE typically drops to 60fps, which still looks great. As for players on Android, it seems it'll be 60fps, but at least the game features full cross-play between all mobile platforms.</p><p>Pre-download will be available today, with the game launching at 9 AM local time across four regional servers: North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.</p><p>Destiny: Rising is the latest installment in the Destiny franchise, expanding upon its well-established universe. Set in a solar system following a major collapse, the game chronicles the ongoing conflict between Guardians and emerging threats tied to a mysterious force known as The Shroud.</p><p>There have been over 10 million players who have pre-registered so far. Players can expect new subclasses, expanded gear customization, and a broader array of missions and world events.</p>

			<p>Kirby has always been a second-string Nintendo property in the West, relatively well known and appreciated, but never on the level of the likes of Mario or Zelda. In recent years, however, the little pink glutton has become far more recognised with the merchandising in particular being ubiquitous. Kirby’s appearances in Smash Bros were a big part of this, but his 3D platforming debut four years ago really put him on the radar. We loved it in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">our original review</a>, with Stefan praising the ‘vibrantly styled decaying world’ and the joy to be had in Kirby’s many transformations. This new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> Edition updates the performance and brings with it a host of new features and levels, but is it worth remembering for those who played the original?</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World – Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2h3bJ8tGrj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, Kirby and the Forgotten Land was already one of the most beautiful games on the Switch. The vivid colours, the visual design, and the variety in environments made it a standout. The Switch 2 version has all that and adds the up-to 4K resolution and performance improvements that are standard with such updates. I noticed no slowdown at all across my playthrough either in handheld or docked modes and the frame rate felt super smooth throughout, jumping from the original 30fps cap to 60fps and with improvements to distant enemy animation rates particularly noticeable. The new levels in the Star Crossed World content are even more visually striking with a crystallised effect transforming the returning environments.</p>


<p>The main added content here is the aforementioned Star Crossed World, a whole new set of levels that runs parallel to the main campaign. I originally played the main game on a different profile so had to restart here as the new levels are added after you beat each boss battle. This results in a drip feed effect that helps keep the new content fresh, but was a little frustrating having to play through the whole game again for this review. Obviously this won’t be the case for most returning players and will work perfectly as intended for newcomers. Having to play the whole story again did help remind me that the Forgotten Land is a pretty lengthy title already!</p>


<p>The Star Crossed World content begins with a mysterious meteor landing on a volcanic island just off the coast of the starting continent. Visiting it shows that a heart-shaped crystal has shattered, revealing a dark and threatening presence within. Kirby has to find all of the scattered pieces, known as Starries, and prevent whatever crashed down from getting loose. These Starries function pretty much identically to the Waddle-Dees from the original game, with some hidden across the levels and others a reward for reaching the end.</p>
<p>The similarity between Waddle-Dees and Starries highlights the fact that this is very much an expansion pack rather than a new game and as such it is worth considering the price. If you’ve already played the original game then £16.99 is not overly expensive for the new content, though it is worth remembering that there is no free upgrade for Nintendo Online subscribers, unlike the two Zelda games, or free performance boost patch. The full retail price is raised to be in line with other first party Switch 2 titles now, but there is plenty of game here for the money.</p>

<p>Alongside the Starries, the Star Crossed World brings several new Copy abilities and some extra secondary content, much of which I’ll leave for you to discover. The Copy abilities are welcome and add to the already stacked roster of skills. Spring Mode helps to increase the verticality of levels, Sign Mode adds in some downhill racing sections, and Gear Mode brings a new aspect to some complex platforming areas. As with all the original modes, however, these are strictly available as setpieces in levels and not freely accessible. Each is necessary to complete the requisite level and mastering them is essential if you want to reach all the secrets.</p>
<p>For completionist players there is a vast amount of optional side content here, with the returning minigames and gatcha unlocks offering almost endless playability. The latter I can take or leave, but there are even more models to collect if that’s your bag. In terms of the minigames these are mostly the same, but there is a new coliseum battle on offer here as well. The bosses throughout Star Crossed World are surprisingly challenging, with the new end fight reaching Dark Souls levels of dodging and counter attacking.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World is the definitive version of one of the Switch’s best games and this game in any form is practically an essential purchase. The new content is well worth the upgrade price too, but if you sold your copy of the Switch version then the full price to return is pretty steep.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This is a bit of a weird one, Ubisoft have sold five of their old games to Atari who will now re-publish them on new platforms. The games are Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. Atari seem to think that money can be made porting them over to the likes of PS5 and Switch 2, something Ubisoft either did not consider or did not think would be profitable.</p>
<p>“Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time,” said Deborah Papiernik, Vice President of New Business. “Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.”</p>


<p>Of those games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/i-am-alive/">I Am Alive</a> may be the most famous as it was in development for seven years and switched developers from Darkworks to Ubisoft Shanghai halfway through that period. Released on PS3 and Xbox 360 the game featured a distinctive colour scheme that was almost all grey. The survival adventure takes place after a cataclysmic disaster that has wiped out most of humanity and reduced cities to rubble, and it was one of the best-selling games of 2012.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Am Alive - Gameplay Trailer (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUfBJrnrPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cold Fear I had to Google and it’s a 2005 action game which Darkworks also developed. Set on a Russian whaling ship you play as &nbsp;Tom Hansen, a member of the&nbsp;United States Coast Guard, tasked with stop an alien parasite infection before the ship reaches land. That does some vaguely familiar I think I played that on PS2.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/child-of-eden/">Child of Eden</a> was developed by Q Entertainment back when Ubisoft dived head first in to any new hardware release, in this case Kinect and PlayStation Move. The on-the-rails shooter featured trippy visuals and an excellent electronic music score.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grow-home/">Grow Home</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grow-up/">Grow Up,</a> are the most recent titles to be released on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Both feature a robot named B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid) in an adveture platformer.</p>

<p>We had a wonderful time with the pink puffball's latest, with the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granting it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">our review</a> and calling it "easily one of the best and most polished 3D platformers on Switch or Switch 2".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186479 @ 1756303285 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with a review out there, so let's check out what some other outlets made of it, to highlight the full range of opinions — even if the options go from 'really good' to 'ever-so-slightly less good'.</p>
<p>Starting at the top, <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-105645-20250827">GAMINGbible</a> opted for a similarly positive 9/10, praising the new levels and the slight increase in challenge that they bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</em> takes an already stellar experience and expands upon almost every aspect that you know and love. A tad more enemy variety would have been nice but it’s hard to see <em>Star-Crossed World</em> as anything other than a must-play experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review">TechRadar</a> kept the good times going with a 4.5/5 review, giving a shout-out to the creativity of the new levels and the performance boost — even if it believes the visual bump should have come for free:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The added areas in <em>Star Crossed World</em> are some of the best yet, and I’d wager playing the game without them would now make the game feel incomplete in some ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropping down ever so slightly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-star-crossed-world/">VGC</a> awarded the game a 4/5, with the outlet enjoying the 12 new stages, though conceding that none of them feel all that revolutionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increase in resolution and switch to 60fps make it look and feel far more polished than before, and while the 12 new stages are essentially little more than an expansion pack, in this case more of the same thing isn't a negative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-review/">TheGamer</a> offered a 4/5, giving particular praise to the new Mouthful Modes while wishing there were more of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 edition is the best way to play an already excellent 3D platformer that finally gives the pink protagonist the level of respect he deserves in the genre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review">IGN</a> pivoted a bit lower and awarded Kirby's latest a 7/10, with the review noting that the bonus stages are fun, but not much of a proper expansion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of cool new enemies, funny Mouthful Mode transformations, and clever ideas put its 12 stages in the top half of the heap overall, but with little beyond that, this comes across less like a proper expansion and more like a DLC level pack to invite you to come back for a weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/08/27/kirby-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review-extra-suck-24010224/">Metro</a> went with the same score and reviewed The Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World a 7/10, calling the bonuses fun but insignificant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is undoubtedly a superior version of Kirby And The Forgotten Land but the problem is that nothing it adds is of any particular significance and £17 is quite a lot for just four hours or so of entertainment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/herman-hulst-says-playstation-is-trying-to-learn-from-live-service-failures-like-concord.1281825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Herman Hulst, once the studio head of Guerilla Games, then president of PlayStation Studios, and now chief executive officer of Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Group, spoke to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">Financial Times (paywalled)</a> about Sony's live service efforts. Following Sony's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-admits-live-service-push-isnt-going-smoothly/">admission of the obvious, that things aren't going great</a>, Hulst says the company is trying to learn from its failures like Concord, adding that if there will be failures, he'd rather they come "<em>early, and cheaply</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I don't want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,</em>" Hulst said. "<em>We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in many different ways. The advantage of every failure</em> <em>[...] is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is</em>."</p>



<p>When PlayStation first began its live service push that Hulst and former Sony Interactive Entertainmnet boss Jim Ryan championed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">Sony wanted to have released 10 live service games by March 2026</a>. Not only is that not going to happen, but most of those projects have been cancelled at this point. Regarding that fact, Hulst is seemingly unbothered, saying that the "<em>number of [live services releases] is not so important</em>."</p>



<p>What's more important to him is "<em>having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities,"</em> and a key aspect of achieving that goal for Hulst is making original IPs, like how Concord was a new IP.</p>



<p>"<em>We take a very intentional approach to IP creation […] understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then become a franchise for people beyond gaming."</em> </p>



<p>Concord, as everyone who does not live under a rock and plays video games today knows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">was a massive failure</a> that did not come as "<em>early and cheaply</em>" as Hulst would prefer. Instead, it made it all the way to launch, lived for two weeks, and died a very costly death. Firewalk Studios was shuttered, and it remains a moment in time that PlayStation fans won't soon forget whenever Sony's live service ambitions crop up.</p>



<p>On those ambitions, we recently had a scare that Fairgames, the upcoming live service title from Haven Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">had been cancelled, though that was quickly refuted</a>. Still, it doesn't look great for that game since Haven Studio's founder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/">Jade Raymond, departed the studio</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of games that don't look like they're in great shape, Bungie is trying to pick up the pieces of Marathon <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">that weren't plagiarized</a>, after delaying the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">without providing a new release date this past June</a>.</p>



<p>To say things could have been going "<em>smoother</em>" is an understatement. Hulst says that PlayStation is trying to learn from its mistakes, which is a good thing, but learning what went wrong is only half the battle. Actually avoiding the error the next time shows the lesson sunk in, and so far, we've no proof from PlayStation that it has learned the lessons taught by its live service push thus far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2's second month on the market was another explosive one, at least in the U.S., where it surpassed 2 million units sold life-to-date, putting it 75% ahead of the unit sales pace set by the Nintendo Switch 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to monthly data from Circana, whose analysis was shared with IGN by Mat Piscatella. Nintendo Switch 2 sales in July were so strong that July hardware spending reached $384 million, the highest July hardware spend since July 2008. The Switch 2 was the best-selling console for the month of July, and unshockingly is the best-selling console in the U.S. year-to date in terms of both unit and dollar sales, surpassing the PlayStation 5. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is now the best-selling accessory of the year in both dollar and unit sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">Already last month</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 became the fastest-selling game console of all time in the U.S., surpassing the PlayStation 4. When we asked Piscatella at the time if that meant the Switch 2 could outsell the Switch 1, he offered a cautious take:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.<p>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the software charts, July was dominated by new releases. EA Sports College Football 26 debuted at No.1 for July and is already the third best-selling game of the year so far in terms of dollar sales. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26, followed it at No.2 for July and No.12 for the year-to-date. Donkey Kong Bananza debuted at No.3 for the month of July and No.20 for the year so far on Circana's rankings, despite Nintendo not sharing digital sales data. And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 debuted at No.4 for the month of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox was also well-represented again on July's monthly charts. Aside from Tony Hawk, Forza Horizon 5 once again made an appearance thanks to its PlayStation release, this time appearing at No.7. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at No.5, and Grounded 2 debuted at No.8. For Grounded 2, its appearance seems largely based on its PC release, as it was the best-selling PC game of the month in dollar sales. However, it's nowhere to be found on Xbox's console rankings, likely due to its Game Pass inclusion and more people choosing to use that subscription for the console version. Microsoft also published four of the top-selling games on both PC (Grounded 2, Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Minecraft) and PlayStation (Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, Forza, and Minecraft) this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds remains the best-selling game of the year so far, and is still followed by the Oblivion remaster. Overall software spending was up 4% year-over-year to $4.5 billion thanks to growth in both mobile and non-mobile subscriptions, offsetting a drop in console software spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Total games spending for the month of July was up 5% year-over-year to $5.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">July 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>EA Sports College Football 26 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports MVP Bundle (2025) (NEW)</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza* (NEW)</li><li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Grounded 2 (NEW)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>MLB The Show 25*</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>F1 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It often takes a sequel to unlock an idea’s full potential. Just look at Assassin’s Creed 2, Mass Effect 2, or Batman: Arkham City – games which erased the imperfections of their predecessors and elevated rough diamonds to all-time-classic status. Based on a new demo I played at gamescom 2025, I’m betting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is about to join that club. Obsidian’s first trip across its satirical galaxy back in 2019 had plenty going for it, but often felt constricted in scope or fell flat in its delivery. Those are flaws that a second attempt (plus a nice chunk of change from Microsoft’s wallet) could rectify, and it seems that’s exactly what has happened, if The Outer Worlds 2’s hour-long prologue is anything to go by. Its gleaming polish, branching pathways, and rich role-playing opportunities suggest this is the game I’d hoped the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds">Outer Worlds</a> had been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prologue demo – and thus The Outer Worlds 2 itself – opens on a gorgeous CGI cinematic that introduces the Earth Directorate, a task force that hops around the galaxy taking on corrupt corporations, corrupt governments, and the ultra-corrupt alliances of corporations and governments. More importantly, it is your employer, and your job in all this is to investigate the production of Skip Drives – engines that enable interstellar travel, but rip dangerous holes in the fabric of space with each FTL jump. In this first mission, you’re dispatched to the Arcadian System to infiltrate a lab and work out the Directorate’s next steps in bringing the company behind these hazardous machines to justice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within minutes of landing at the lab’s dock, the prologue offers up a multitude of ways to handle its first problem. Unlocking the bulkhead doors to the lab activates the area’s defences, and now you need to get past a small army of combat robots and automated turrets. You could, of course, shoot your way through them, or drop into a crouch and sneak past them, weaving through their sightlines. But those are just your base, vanilla choices. The Outer Worlds 2 also provides a much more interesting set of opportunities thanks to its RPG foundations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, the security booth in which this escapade begins is the final resting place of Cadet Robin Mowry, and rifling through his pockets will reward you with his personnel ID. When the defenses are triggered, you can phone another cadet working elsewhere in the station, impersonate Mowry, and ask for the defences to be shut down. Your new "colleague" will comply… but only if you can navigate a conversation about “mental refreshment.” You see, Mowry recently underwent a chemical lobotomy as punishment for a work misdemeanor, and so you’ll need to perform your verbal coercion without coming across as ungrateful for your life-correcting treatment. A response enabled by using Speech, one of 12 core skills you can build your character around, is the final key to unlocking a safe route to the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not good with words? Well, maybe you’ve built a character who knows how to breach security software. There’s a service duct that leads out of the security booth and towards the mechanic’s control bay, inside of which you can use the Hack skill to disable the area’s defences. And so, in a single objective alone, I was able to identify four different approaches. This is a prologue, of course, and so they are all easily achieved, but it feels like a statement of intent: each challenge will have multiple methods of approach, with unique pathways catering for a variety of specialised character builds. If Obsidian has been able to deliver on this across the entire length and breadth of the campaign, then that’s something to be very excited about.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The approach to choice differed throughout the demo. While that first area was about demonstrating the multiple methods of solving a single problem, later I was presented with quite literally a branching pathway, with each route leading to an area designed to cater to a specific play style. Heading left to Security Ops would take me to a map built around stealth and silent kills, while turning right and progressing through Central Dispatch led to a showcase for conflict and gunplay. I initially opted for the former and soon found myself in an office complex clearly built on the foundational tenets of Deus Ex. Ventilation ducts provided alternate pathways that led to helpful vantage points, while a knife and throwable distraction devices found hidden behind floor panels allowed me to sneakily dispatch the area’s staff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Security Ops’ main pathway is designed to cater to simple stealth mechanics, but poking around revealed further opportunities that were much more enticing than a basic backstab. In one office, I was able to use my Hack skill to obtain a key card for the Pump Room, a locked building that provided an alternative route to my final objective in the Skip Drive lab. Built into the walls of that area was another set of ducts, which not only allowed me to bypass a guard patrol but also led to a set of switches that enabled the building’s automatic turrets, which happily poked holes in my enemies following a single button press. The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries, especially this early in its campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the original Outer Worlds was never under scrutiny for a lack of role-playing opportunities. It did, however, receive fair criticism for its soft and mushy shooting. Choosing Central Dispatch on a second playthrough of the prologue was an opportunity to see just how far Obsidian has improved its once-damp weapons, and the good news is that the two on offer in this demo – a pistol and rifle pairing with early 1900s detailing – feel fantastic. The pistol is snappy, with a light kick and a satisfying reload, while the repeating rifle packs a much bigger punch at the cost of a long, lever-action cycle between shots. That latter aspect helps cement The Outer Worlds 2’s vintage-futuristic aesthetic, but more importantly demands use of the Tactical Time Dilation Device, which slows time to a crawl so you can more easily score headshots. Back in 2019, this feature admittedly felt like a knock-off of Fallout’s VATS, but with the improved gunfeel of this sequel, TTDD now comes across more like a genuine bullet time system. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the stealthy, opportunity-filled Security Ops pathway, Central Dispatch was much more limited with what it had to offer. A conversation with the cadet I had fooled with my impersonation of his colleague at the start of the demo turned sour, and he set a squadron of heavy Dragoon robots on me. This did push the combat intensity a little further, but did not come coupled with any inventive approaches that I could identify. Still, the heavier damage the robots inflicted forced me to repeatedly use the Medical Inhaler – a health kit that builds a toxicity meter with every huff. Max out that gauge and you’re forced to wait a duration until you can use it again. It’s a fun riff on Fallout’s drug addiction system, but one that works as a battle constraint rather than a stat impact. It demands you think tactically about when you ingest those HP-restoring chemicals, and while I imagine it could cause a few frustrating deaths in the fiercest battles, I think it’s at the very least an interesting idea worth experimenting with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m always going to take the sneakier or more creative option when it comes to RPGs, and I’ll admit I had a lot more fun in Security Ops than Central Dispatch. But I will say that those short shootouts convinced me that I’ll actually enjoy it when the guns are drawn, something I can’t say about the original game’s underwhelming combat. Like its fantasy sibling Avowed, much of its newfound punch is down to visual polish, and the same level of detail can be felt across the entire prologue. There are bespoke animations for almost every skill – lockpicking sees your character’s hand align a set of pins on a Mag-Pick, hacking sees you arrange the dials on a Bypass Shunt probe before jamming it into a computer terminal, and applying the Engineering skill to a maintenance panel sees you rub your hands in anticipation before twisting and tightening an arrangement of steampunk valves. It feels expensive, but more importantly it connects and anchors you into this fantastical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it’s not clear by now, I’m really into what Obsidian is doing with The Outer Worlds 2. The prologue features so many cool opportunities, particularly when it comes to non-combat or combat-adjacent approaches, and I hope that they are all being served up in this opening hour as something of an establishment of the rules – “<em>This </em>is how you can use your character, and similar opportunities await.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I appreciated Obsidian’s prior attempt at this universe, I never totally fell for it, but what the studio has achieved here in this prologue is exactly what I’d hoped for the first time around. And that’s exactly why I’m willing to bet that The Outer Worlds 2 will be one of <em>those </em>sequels. The ones that finally take an idea all the way to greatness. Hopefully, I’ll pass that “prediction” check with a critical success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s “game + add-on” rereleases have been hard to predict based on that label alone. Super Mario 3D World’s jump to Switch 1 came with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Bowser’s Fury</a>, which was essentially an entirely new game, while the more recent Super Mario Party rolled onto Switch 2 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">Jamboree TV expansion</a> that was simultaneously the same as the base game but also totally separate and different in a few odd ways. Now it’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s turn, and its Star-Crossed World add-on is a Kirby-sized gulp of fresh air simply because of how easy it is to explain: it’s just a regular ol’ modestly-sized DLC. It might be packaged as an upgrade, but this small collection of fun new levels isn’t anything more complicated than a good excuse to hop back onto the warp star for a few hours, even if there’s not much to it overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get the boring business talk out of the way first: The only ways to access Star-Crossed World are to either pay $20 to upgrade your Switch 1 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land to the Switch 2 Edition (which also comes with some welcome but inessential performance improvements) or buy the Switch 2 version fresh for $80. You could also buy the Switch 1 version for $60 and skip the added content, but there’s no way to get the Switch 2 enhancements without it. Because those enhancements aren’t very significant, this really does just feel like DLC in a very traditional sense, and as such this review is going to focus on Star-Crossed World alone rather than the bundle it’s being marketed as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other reason that makes the most sense to me is because my review of Kirby and the Forgotten Land still holds up exactly the same as when I wrote it, three-and-a-half years ago. I won’t be recapping the basics here, so I encourage you to go read or watch that review if you’ve never played it (a game I still heartily recommend on its own), and then come back when you are considering the DLC itself. Here is what I said at the time: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star-Crossed World weaves a little side story nicely into Forgotten Land’s existing campaign. Immediately after you complete the first world (or just as soon as you load it up if you already have a save beyond that), a mysterious meteor crashes into the ocean and sends chunks of blue crystal all across the map. The story, which is not the reason you are here at all, is predictably thin as a Waddle Dee with a cool beret sends you out to collect the “Starries” that have been scattered across the land in order to reseal the evil being inside the meteor that is <em>prophecized to end all existence.</em> Ya know, normal Kirby stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What that means, practically speaking, is that 12 new “Starry Stages” have been added to the map, two in each of the six worlds from the base game. These borrow locations and themes from the levels they are next to, adding crystal flowers that alter the landscape when you touch them. There are also some brand-new enemies, challenges, and even awesome background songs. I was initially concerned that these stages would <em>just</em> be remixes, but that proved not to be the case – they are made up of almost entirely new areas, and the handful of times you do revisit spots like in the excellent mall level or exciting amusement park, it feels entertainingly referential rather than like a cheap rehash. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There aren’t really any misses across the 12 new Starry Stages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren’t really any misses across these dozen dungeons, with clever twists put on existing mechanics and plenty of interesting new ones to tease your brain. One standout had me hopping between moving platforms that were coming toward the screen, frantically trying to find the right path to the next one before getting pushed off the edge. Another revisits the very silly “pipe” Mouthful Mode transformation to send you rolling down a roller coaster track that you need to reveal extra pieces of in real time. None of them put up too serious of a fight, since this <em>is</em> a Kirby game, but they are a bit more challenging than the rest of Forbidden Land across the board, making them a nice additional “post-game” option to keep you playing, even though they actually unlock in tandem with the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mouthful transformations, there are three new ones introduced in Star-Crossed World: a spring that lets you bounce up high and then slam down hard, a gear that allows you to roll along walls, and a sign that essentially turns Kirby into a sled for a few high-speed downhill sections. All of them are used to great effect, opening the door to some clever new puzzle ideas – I particularly liked how you’re asked to launch yourself between separated sections of wall as the gear, which is a little bit more mechanically nuanced than I expected from such a simple item. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the existing transformations are revisited in smart ways as well, with options like the stalwart traffic cone getting multiple sections that prove there is more than a little gas left in the tanks. Even the stairs transformation, which in the main game I thought was… well, pretty dumb, is actually used in interesting ways here: there’s a short section where you have to leave your stairs on a moving conveyor belt then hop up elsewhere to complete a task before it falls off a ledge. Neat! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Kirby’s more traditional transformations didn’t get the same attention – there are no new ones and no new upgrades for any of the existing set. Perhaps more importantly, if you have already beaten Forgotten Land and are returning to this DLC years later like I did, having a maxed-out toolset already can make some of the beefed-up enemies a bit too easy to shred. One new enemy type in particular acts as a fun little recurring miniboss, calling down meteors that you have to dodge as you break away progressive layers of crystal armor – but a charged-up attack from a fully upgraded copy ability can trivialize that otherwise-interesting encounter from the jump. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby and the Forgotten Land: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, the failures of Star-Crossed World are less about what it does and more about what it doesn’t. It took me about three hours to finish what’s here, and while the stages themselves are all top notch, it feels slight as an actual expansion beyond that. There are no boss fights across those 12 levels, no new Treasure Road bonus stages (which were a big highlight of the original) even for the new Mouthful options, and nothing really changes back at your Waddle Dee village – although there is a little bit more to see beyond the Starry Stages that I can’t get into here. Even the new star-based currency you collect became fairly uninteresting once I realized that its <em>only</em> use was unlocking a new set of gacha figurines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not like there’s nothing worthwhile here, and it’s not like I got 100% completion across those 12 stages right away – just like the base game, I didn’t usually make it to the end with every single collectible on my first try, so there’s plenty more secrets left for me to sniff out. But Star-Crossed World can’t help but feel like a drop in the bucket when you compare it to everything that was already available. The levels it adds are great, but that single afternoon of fresh platforming is pretty close to the entire package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition changes don’t do much to entice you, either. You’ll no longer see NPCs in the distance moving at comically low frame rates, but that’s the only change that really jumped out at me. Don’t get me wrong, the higher FPS and resolution are welcome, and it all looks quite nice… but it didn’t really look bad to begin with. Forgotten Land was such a stylized game already, one without any of the real performance issues other Switch 1 games were able to fix in the jump to Switch 2, so the ceiling on how much better it could look without a more substantial overhaul wasn’t too high in my eyes. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-outer-worlds-review-fall-deeply-into-the-best-fallout-like-game-in-years/">nearly six years now</a> since <em>The Outer Worlds</em> threw players into the deep end, forcing them to acclimate to the game's far-future, ultra-corporate intergalactic dystopia amid lots of <em>Fallout</em>-style shooting and questing. The prologue for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>—which I got to play as part of a preview build ahead of the game's planned October 29 launch—throws players into a different kind of deep end, asking them to fill the shoes of an agent in the storied semi-militarized police force of the Earth Directorate.</p>
<p>The over-the-top propaganda that leads the game off suggests the Earth Directorate is here to protect colonists from out-of-control corporations and tyrannical governments. But your first mission goes in a different direction, sending you on a secret mission to the "out of jurisdiction" Arcadian system, a secretive dictatorship where all the skip drives that power interstellar travel are supposedly manufactured. You've been asked to help expropriate a rare, "unsealed" skip drive core, which can then be opened up, studied, and maybe even copied without the risk of catastrophic explosion (the "right to repair" folks in the audience might be nodding their heads sagely at this point).</p>
<h2>Choose your choice</h2>
<p>I won't spoil things by discussing just how the mission goes off the rails or talking about the somewhat vague twist that closes out the playable prologue. But I will gush a bit about how the first game's mix of retro-futuristic set-dressing and sardonic, cynical writing style immediately shine through, even with the change in perspective. A mix of strong voice acting and motion capture immediately drew me back into the <em>Outer Worlds</em> universe, even when the characters were delivering ridiculous lines like "You’re not just a cog in the machine. You’re THE cog!"</p>

<p>Before you set out, you can customize your character's look and background, down to a wide variety of fetching prosthetic limbs. Instead of the explicit D&amp;D-style attribute points from the first game, though, the sequel lets you choose instead from a selection of broad skills and traits (both positive and negative) that offer percentage-based modifiers to everything from base health and melee damage to companion ability charge time.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is pretty up front about showing you how these choices matter in more than just a statistical sense. A malfunctioning door early in the game can be opened directly by a "brawny" character's strength or an engineer's ingenuity, for instance, while everyone else has to figure out a way to crawl around the problem through some nearby ductwork. And while UI tooltips note which traits you need for many choices, certain gameplay paths and options at points seem completely hidden from characters without the right traits.</p>

      </figure>

<p>The sequel's early moments also seem to go out of their way to craft custom lines for NPCs to fit your chosen background, in ways I didn't really notice until I replayed the prologue with different characters. When I played an agent with a "Heroic" background, for instance, my mission briefing focused on how important the skip drive was to "the imposition of righteousness" throughout the galaxy. My "Professor" character (described in game as an Indiana Jones-style "full contact archaeologist) got sold on the "propagation of knowledge" the drive enables.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Then there's the way the game stresses a number of early dialogue choices, telling you how your fellow agents will remember when you choose to treat them with eager support or stern rebuke at key moments. Without getting too much into early game spoilers, I'll say that the medium-term consequences of these kinds of decisions are not always obvious; concerned players might want to keep a few save files handy for gaming out the "best" outcomes from their choices.</p>
<h2>Bang bang</h2>
<p>The early moment-to-moment gameplay in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be broadly familiar to those who played the original game, right down to the Tactical Time Dilation device that slows down enemies enough for you to line up a perfect headshot (though not enough for <em>Max Payne-</em>style acrobatics, unfortunately). But I did find myself missing the first game's zippy double-jump-style dodging system, which doesn't seem to be available in the prologue of the sequel, at least.</p>

<p>The game's first action setpiece lets you explicitly choose whether to go in guns blazing or focus on stealth and sneak attacks, but characters that invest in conversational skills might find they're able to talk their way past some of the early encounters. When it comes time to engage in a firefight, thus far I've found the "Normal" difficulty to be laughably easy, while the "Hard" difficulty is a bit too punishing, making me wish for more fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The prologue stops before I was able to engage with important elements like the leveling system or the allied computer-controlled companions, making it a rather incomplete picture of the full game. Still, it was enough to whet my appetite for what seems set to be another tongue-in-cheek take on the space adventure genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Herdling is as much of an experience as it is a game. There is gameplay as you gather and herd goat-like animals through the world, but it’s there to further your emotional travels with these creatures. It’s a game for dreamers, for the innocent, for those who delighted in floating around in Thatgamecompany’s Journey.</p>
<p><iframe title="Herdling - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohjV5xwMuxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game opens with the unnamed and silent protagonist waking up in an underpass and walking into a decaying urban sprawl. Here they meet their first Calicorn, shaggy horned creatures that come in different shapes and sizes, from stately elders who sit on their hindquarters and tower above our hero, to small bundles of fluff and feathers who gamble about like excited rabbits. A few button presses later, and you can start herding your tame Calicorn through the city and out to pastures new.</p>


<p>As you progress through the various biomes, you can pick up more Calicorns and soon have a fairly large herd to move around, an act that does become a little frustrating due to the control mechanism. You can direct the Calicorns only if you are behind one of them, and then use the joystick to move a flowery cursor to indicate where the Calicorns should move next. However, as you have to do this when the Calicorns are moving, sometimes at speed, and the cursor can dance across the world as the distance and angle between yourself and the Calicorns constantly changes. It feels like a control system designed for a mouse that had to be deployed into a console game, which uses less precise controllers.</p>


<p>The Calicorns can be powered up by flowers; Wade through a patch of blue blooms and you gain a speed boost to use when you wish, while red will extend the boost. These are used when you need to climb up slippery rock slopes or crash through tough bushes, but are also liberally spread throughout meadows. Here you can gallop across wide areas, the wind racing, the music soaring as you do, and it’s moment of pure delight.</p>
<p>There are some very simple puzzles, most of which involve finding a path to a stranded Calicorn or pushing a switch or lever, and you can lose a Calicron in a couple of sections. The first way for one to die is if it wanders off a crumbling cliff and plummets like a lemming, but the second comes from the skies. The chapters near the end of the game include monstrous bird creatures which sit on ledges and watch your fluffy friends as you wander through the land. The birds are activated by trampling into specific rock formations, and areas of the game are littered with these, meaning you have to carefully manage the herd and use precise instructions, something that becomes increasingly difficult as your herd grows.</p>

<p>Each chapter ends with a campfire where you can bond more with your horned friends. You can assign each one a name of your choice, pet them, groom them, and later play fetch. While these activities are pleasant, they are fairly limited, and once you have performed each action a couple of times, there appears to be no apparent incentive to do them again. You herd can also get injured, their coats becoming red with blood but this does not seem to affect them in any other way. Video game logic applies here and feeding the beasts fruit that can be harvested from convenient bushes quickly heals all injuries, your Calicorn will be happy bundle of fluff within seconds.&nbsp; You can also pick up additional adornments for the Calicorns and while it is a nice idea, they do end up looking like badly dressed Christmas trees.</p>
<p>Like Journey there is no dialogue and the story is told through imagery, starting with a billboard in the city that shows Calicorns in their native home. There are also murals to discover and images in dreams that hint at a larger story, but how you interpret these is up to you. Music &nbsp;from composer Joel Schoch plays a huge part, with calming flutes in the quieter moments and rambunctious trills&nbsp; when racing through fields, and when the music does quieten there are emotive sounds of winds and forests to immerse you, it is a great game to play using headphones.</p>

<p>Your enjoyment of Herdling will depend entirely if you can connect with the Calicorns, do you care about their future? For the first three of the roughly four hours of game time, I did. I rescued them from wrecked trains, fed them, named them after my pets and happily ran through forests watching the smaller Calicorn tails bobbing up and down like bunnies. However, as the herd grew and become more unwieldly I started to lose my patience with the control mechanic and started consciously sacrificing Calicorns just so I could plough through another Bird monster area, While it might not have been quite so much like real life herding, a simpler mechanic, such as direct line from the protagonist to the spot you want the herd to move to, without having to be behind the Calicorns, would have removed all my frustrations from the game and all the Calicrons would be alive. In other words I am blaming the developers for the casual murder of the fluffballs, shame on them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for July 2026. That marks the second-straight year that EA Sports College Football took the top spot the month it was released.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, College Football 26 takes the top spot over from Elden Ring: Nightreign, which led the way in May and June. For July, Nightreign finds itself at 16th.</p>



<p>Following College Football 26 comes, well, College Football 26 again. At least, in a way. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both College Football 26 and Madden 26, came in second in sales. That was followed up by Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As far as new games finding themselves in the Top 20, there were 5 games joining the fray. Four of the new releases all were in the Top 5, while the other new release, Grounded 2, came in eighth.</p>



<p>With five new releases in the Top 20, as well as a return of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, that means six games fell out of the list. Leaving the Top 20 were Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Mario Kart World, and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>Check out the full list of the best-selling video games for July 2025 below, and let us know what games in the top 20 you’ve played in the comments and over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Lucas takes a break from Hollywood stardom to lay the smack down on any baddies standing in his way, with grappling prowess and a fully-weaponized skateboard (meaning he hits people with it).

Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and other unlikely allies including Lucas and Roxie must bash their way across the city, from its streets to its beaches and maybe even back in time to save the band, the city and the world. A total of seven playable fighters will be featured, with Scott and Ramona set to gain more confirmed allies ahead of <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>‘s release.</p><p>Battle it out across a wild, video game warped Toronto with bursting colors and deep-cut Scott Pilgrim references, completing quests while defeating the gangs that rule over different parts of the city. Enemies can be dispatched with each character’s unique, upgradable toolkit, or with different items found in the game’s highly interactable environment, from baseball bats to demonic rods, turnips and more. Featuring a brand-new storyline co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games, as well as all-new music from Scott Pilgrim alumni Anamanaguchi, <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> delivers a bold new chapter in the franchise for longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p></blockquote><p><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,808 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,585 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,296 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, Switch, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640950/Scott_Pilgrim_EX/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in early 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>When you think Ubisoft, you usually think about its tentpole franchises like Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six Siege, but the company has also released several great small-scale games across PC, console, and mobile. Some of these IP have been dormant for years, but Atari has inked a new deal to acquire five Ubisoft classics and bring them to modern platforms.</p><p>As part of the deal, Atari has purchased the IP for Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Grow Home, Grow Up, and Child of Eden. These were all one-off games (save for Grow Home and Grow Up) published by Ubisoft and developed by numerous teams, but in terms of console releases, most of them remained locked to Xbox 360 and PS3. Aside from their PC, Xbox 360, and PC releases.</p><p>"Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for longtime players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time," Ubisoft VP of New Business Deborah Papiernik said in a press statement (via <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BusinessWire</a>). "Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, and we're excited to see how they'll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways."</p><p>Atari has picked a solid collection of games, as I Am Alive offered a tense survival experience in a post-apocalyptic world, Cold Fear played like The Thing meets Resident Evil, and the Grow games are delightful platformers. Child of Eden is the real draw here, as the 2011 game from Tetris Effect director Tetsuya Mizuguchi was a music-powered rail-shooter that appealed to fans of the developer's previous work on Rez and Lumines.</p><p>Meanwhile, Atari has been on a strategic tear lately with acquisitions. It recently became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-creator-acquired-by-atari-in-5-million-deal/1100-6533517/" data-ref-id="1100-6533517">the majority owner of Thunderful Group</a>--the company behind the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steamworld-build/">SteamWorld games</a>--and the last couple of years saw it double down on its retro focus by acquiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-buys-studio-that-makes-very-good-atari-games-and-remasters/1100-6518773/">Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse</a>, both of which specialize in remasters of classic games.

                <p dir="ltr">We're about a month out from the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" data-ref-id="5000-654978">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and later this week Sega is offering up another opportunity for you to try out the game through its latest Open Network Test--and an opportunity to see if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-still-doesnt-feel-like-it-has-an-identity-of-its-own/1100-6534251/" data-ref-id="1100-6534251">come away from it feeling better than us</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A new trailer shared on the official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel provided a nice overview of what you can expect from this latest beta test for the game, including how long it's running, and what kind of customization options will be available.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LX_P9EkIbU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6LX_P9EkIbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3 dir="ltr">When does the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test start?</h3><p dir="ltr">The exact dates the network test kicks off depends on where exactly you're located. In the US, for those in a PT timezone, it's running from August 28 to September 1, whereas in the ET timezone, the UK, and Japan, it's running from August 29 to September 1--it's all at the same time; the dates just differ because of timezone differences.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Start Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">August 28, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">August 29, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">End Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">September 1, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">September 2, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">How can I sign up to the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">All you need to do is head to your platform of choice, which includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0177-PPSA30664_00-SONICRACINGCWONT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9PGDMMC6QGGP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/sonic-racing-crossworlds-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-7aec63" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic</a>, and download the Open Network Test through their respective storefronts. After that, you'll be able to play! You can already preload the test ahead of its start time this week.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What's included in the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">There's quite a lot available in the test, notably nine whole courses to choose from and zip through like Metal Harbour, Mystic Jungle, and Colorful Mall. Amongst all of those there are also seven CrossWorlds to get transported to while you're racing, such as Magma Planet and Holoska.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll have 12 characters to play as, obviously including Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow, and on August 31 you'll also be able to play as Persona 5's Joker--more on that in a moment. The test will feature 21 vehicles across five different types, and you'll have 42 gadgets to modify your playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of modes, there's the standard Grand Prix, which typically contains four races in one cup, World Match--which sees you racing online against 11 other players and features a World Rank you can increase--and Time Trials, a mode that lets you race for the best time on various tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the Joker Festival, which starts August 31 and runs for 24 hours from 12:01 AM ET. The event sees players split into three different teams, where you can earn points and Persona-themed titles. Whichever team comes out on top at the end of the event will also win an exclusive title. It is probably worth noting that save data does not carry over to the full game, however.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the technical details, you also don't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass subscription to play online, though to play the World Match and Festival modes on Nintendo Switch you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Cross-play is also enabled for the network test.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out September 25, and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

Plenty of games like Build A Rocket Boy's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Mindseye</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will land a sweet spot in a highly-watched showcase and still struggle to stick the landing. Succeeding in an event like Gamescom Opening Night Live, the Future Games Show or an Xbox Showcase takes strategy and a ton of forethought.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what can a developer do besides "make a good trailer?" And how do they make their game appealing to showcase curators like Xbox, The Game Awards, or Future? According to Xbox head of premiere broadcasts Tina Amini, the answer to both question comes down to one word: "surprise."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In conversations after this year's Xbox Showcase, Amini and other developers from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-spins-up-new-fighting-game-studio-quarter-up">Quarter Up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dungeons-of-hinterberg-shows-how-all-games-can-feel-like-vacations-">Microbird Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinecreekgames.com/">Pine Creek Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> explained how exploring that surprise factor helps developers succeed in broadcasts like this year's Xbox Showcase (this conversation took place before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Microsoft laid off 9,000 employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, among them hundreds of game developers at companies like King, Zenimax, Activision Blizzard, and beyond).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just about sticking a "world reveal" tag in front of your trailer—it's using those critical moment in the months before launch to show curators and players why they can't look away from your game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/steam-defaults-to-language-specific-review-scores-to-provide-a-better-indication-of-user-sentiment-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Steam defaults to language-specific review scores to provide 'a better indication of user sentiment'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating contrast between your game and big first-party hits">Creating contrast between your game and big first-party hits</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While other organizations may only run one or two livestreaming broadcasts per year, Amini explained her job is to produce nine events across a 12-month cycle. These include high-profile streams like the SGF and Gamescom-aligned showcases, and more curated affairs like the January Developer Direct.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini and her Xbox colleagues plan these events around major Xbox marketing beats like this year's reveal of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-first-xbox-handhelds-have-finally-arrived">ROG Xbox Ally,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or major game unveilings like Obsidian Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/f_MpCHtM6U0?si=0jgYuo1vOTlB86T1">Grounded 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but then take a broad look at developers at third-party developers (often ones with some kind of relationship with Microsoft) to fill out the show.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For the June showcase in particular, we start talking internally by the end of the [prior] year, but it's not until January where conversations really start solidifying," Amini said in regards to picking games to show off. Developers can sometimes pitch as little as a slide deck or as much as a development build to get her team's attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to get representation across the industry...because we know our audience is diverse too," she said, pointing to player reactions for the reveal of indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/u68h-Af1HiA">There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from developer Friday Sundae.

Pine Creek Games CEO Benjamin Salqvist explained that when his studio's game Winter Burrow debuted in the 2023 Xbox Showcase, the "hand-drawn comic book art style" proved to be a distinct differentiator</span></p><p>Image via Pine Creek Games/Noodlecake.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was selected this year as part of what Amini described as a "business message" of promoting Xbox Play Anywhere, selling the different kinds of games that might be appropriate across the wide range of devices that can support Xbox Game Pass. But no matter what Xbox's business message is, Amini's old journalism instincts still guide her to look for the "news factor" of the games they select.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news factor doesn't have to be a world premiere or a big launch date announcement (though those are both fine options if that's your pitch to Xbox). If you previously announced a game and players haven't heard from it in a while, it showing up with a fresh new trailer can be the news factor. Shadow dropping a game can be a news factor. Even a presentation of the development team can be the news factor.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Balatro publisher Playstack delivered a marketing masterclass</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here Amini referred to Sandfall Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/o9KQ4rlymEQ">which made its debut</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the 2024 Xbox Showcase (the game made its debut on Xbox Game Pass as well as PC and PlayStation 5).

"It's a multi-step process," he explained. "After getting invited to apply, you'll send a storyboard, then an animatic, and so on. At each of these stages there's a good chance your game will be eliminated because let's face it, there are so many great games out there competing for these spots."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini said in this part of the process her "writers room" of producers and marketers uses the team's different tastes to pick games that represent different genres, eventually "putting a bet" down on games that they think will resonate with players because it resonates with them.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What follows isn't so much a process of "just send us your trailer," it's effectively a rapid marketing consultation project as developers prepare storyboards and animatics of what they'll display in the show. She said she regularly helps developers tweak their trailers at the earliest possibility for a maximum return, and she regularly sees players react to showcased games in a way that validates her feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Great trailers show you something interesting every couple of seconds—a great vista, an unusual gameplay mechanic or some action that builds upon it, an intriguing piece of dialogue, or something mysterious, epic, or funny," observed Microbird's other cofounder Regina Reisinger.</span></p><p>Image via Quarter Up/Skybound.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amini also said her team sometimes selects games that can quickly drive "intrigue" among players. She pointed to 2025 Showcase participant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/skybound-spins-up-new-fighting-game-studio-quarter-up">Quarter Up</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which is owned by Skybound) as a case study of this strategy. "You'll see a name—it might be a studio name—and there might be intrigue from the audience," Amini said. "They'll go 'what is Skybound doing with this new studio?'" She described these players as the ones who will "investigate" what they see, and learn details like how Quarter Up was founded for the specific purpose of making the Invincible-themed fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Invincible VS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quarter Up executive producer Chris Paulson explained that in its run-up appearance to the showcase, the team worked carefully to ensure preparing assets and a demo build for the Showcase didn't eat too much into the game's development.

"The Xbox showcase casts a very wide net," he said, while Wholesome Direct put the dungeon crawling vacation simulator in front of a "smaller audience" very focused on its niche. After revealing the game and launching its Steam page in a 2023 Xbox showcase, the game racked up 19,000 wishlists during the event.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Salqvist told Game Developer that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winter Burrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> landed 10k Steam wishlists after its appearance in the same event. Quarter Up declined to share any wishlist statistics for their reveal—but if you're looking for a decent marketing benchmark, it shared that the team racked up over 92,000 followers across its social media platform in the 72 hours after the reveal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Succeeding in a streaming showcase at any scale is still more of an art than a science.

<p>Part of the ship, part of the crew</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hello Games is introducing the first major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> update since the game launched on Switch 2, and it looks like a cool one.</p>
<p>The big new addition in the 'Voyagers' update is the chance to design and build your very own spaceship. These ships ('Corvettes') can be as big or as small as you'd like, with real interiors packing in med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters and more for you to waltz around even mid-flight.</p>
<p>To really hammer home the space captain vibes, you can bring aboard friends as your crew, letting them help with designs and travel across the universe with you. What's more, you can pop the hatch on your Corvette and head out for a space walk, gliding around your rig or hopping to another nearby ship.</p>
<p>For design inspiration purposes, here's a closer look at some of these Corvettes in action:</p>

<p>With so many additional moving parts (spaceships being redesigned while planets are rendered in the distance is no small task), we'll be interested to see how the little Switch version holds up. Fortunately, the beefier Switch 2 edition — which we described as "an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — should offer a smoother ride.</p>

			<p>When Xbox PR reached out about a digital preview for The Outer Worlds 2, I literally beamed at the opportunity. They had done exactly the same for Avowed a couple of months ahead of that Obsidian RPG's launch, and that demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did a lot to get me even more hyped for the final game</a>. It was an extensive demo that provided more or less free rein to roam Avowed's first region of Dawnshore, explore it, and get a proper taste of what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full game would be all about</a>. It also included companions, who are always a big part of Obsidian's roleplaying games, as fans of the Irvine-based studio know all too well.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the demo that was shared for The Outer Worlds 2 is much more limited. It starts at what appears to be the very beginning of the game; in that regard, it's akin to Avowed. However, whereas the latter game's demo went much further than the tutorial mission, this one does not. I learned afterward that it was the same demo available at Gamescom 2025, and it would have made sense there given the one-hour slot limit, but for a digital preview, it is a thorough disappointment. </p>



<p>The demo doesn't even provide access to companions, so you're completely on your own for the mission. Moreover, it does not include any explorable zone like the aforementioned Dawnshore from Avowed. This <span>straightforward mission doesn't really showcase the '<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/" target="_blank">much more expansive worlds</a>' touted by the developer in recent The Outer Worlds 2 media blasts, or the many new cool gadgets&nbsp;</span>showcased in previous videos.</p>



<p>Sure, there were a couple of different paths to take while going through the mission. You can, for example, use the Eloquence skill (provided that you've picked it up when creating your character) to convince an NPC to disable the automated security and get you into the facility without having to fight the robots. You can also use other skills like Hacking or Engineering or Lockpicking to unlock specific doors. But all those features were already in the first The Outer Worlds game. I hoped to get a peek at what's new and improved, but this build didn't have much of that.</p>



<p>It did have the option to play in third-person view, which was completely absent from the previous installment. You will have to select it from the game's options, and there are two choices: a close third-person camera and a far one. Honestly, though, just like with Avowed, I believe they are there more for accessibility reasons than a genuine alternative. It's fine if you just cannot stomach first-person due to health concerns like motion sickness, but otherwise, you're much better off with first-person; the animations do not look nearly as good in third-person.</p>



<p>Another thing that Obsidian said it improved in The Outer Worlds 2 is the shooting part, which was refined based on feedback from Halo Studios and the analysis of Bungie's Destiny. The improvements are definitely there; shooting feels more solid, but still not quite as good as a top-notch shooter. Melee combat, unfortunately, still doesn't appear to be as in-depth as Avowed, and the lack of a dodge button certainly does not help.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The combat gameplay relies heavily on the 'Tactical Time Dilation' device (which also returns from the original title). This device allows the player to slow down time, which is essential if you want to survive against multiple foes at higher difficulty levels. The sequel does add destructible cover, but again, this was not featured in the demo build.</p>



<p>Lastly, from a technical standpoint, The Outer Worlds 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Unreal Engine 4. The visual improvement compared to the original is noticeable but perhaps slightly less significant than I would have hoped, even with ray traced lighting, shadows, and reflections enabled. The game also already supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, although the implementation might still need some tweaking. </p>



<p>On PC, the graphics settings already offer plenty of options for users to tinker with, including a built-in frame rate limiter, five upscaling options (TAA, TSR, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS, the only one to support Frame Generation), a slider for Field of View, and a toggle for Chromatic Aberration. On my RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the demo ran smoothly without any stuttering, but like I said, it was a small level. The real test will be on those larger open-ended areas. Given that the game will launch simultaneously on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, I hoped to see support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and/or adaptive triggers, but there seems to be only regular rumble.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite the fairly disappointed tone of this preview, I am still confident that Obsidian will deliver a meaty, fun, and enjoyable roleplaying game with The Outer Worlds 2. It's just that the demo they provided did not give us much of an opportunity to discover its new features and improvements.</p>



<p>Still, the full game is just two months away from being released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Look forward to our review ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned October 29 launch</a>. </p>
