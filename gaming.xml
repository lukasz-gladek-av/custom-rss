			<p><a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/">Enotria: The Last Song</a>, the soulslike developed by Jyamma Games released earlier this year on PC and PlayStation 5, will launch very soon on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Today, it has been confirmed the game will be released on Microsoft's current generation consoles tomorrow, December 12th. Besides being able to explore the sunny game world inspired by Italian landscapes, Xbox players will be able to enjoy the experience complete with all the improvements that have been introduced on PC and PlayStation 5 over the months, such as improved weapon menu interface that now displays average damage of weapons and rarity value, improved fast travel menu and much more.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song was originally supposed to be released on Xbox consoles at the same time as on PC and PlayStation 5, but the game was delayed shortly before launch due to communication issues with Microsoft that prevented the certification process from proceeding as intended. Once the issue had become public, however, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-apologises-to-enotria-the-last-song-developers/">apologized</a> to Jyamma Games and started working closely with them to get the issues sorted out and release the game on Xbox Series X and S as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. The game will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S tomorrow, December 12th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/possible-new-bend-studio-ip-in-development-after-screenshots-surface/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that there is a new IP being developed by Bend Studio, the developers behind Days Gone and the Syphon Filter franchise. There are already plenty of great games in development from Sony-owned studios, with games like Ghost of Yotei and Marathon being announced to be in development. Despite that, these games don't yet have a release date, and we all know that PlayStation loves to keep its secrets. However, it seems that one of the secrets has accidentally surfaced online and has potentially been revealed before it was supposed to.</p>
<p>This project is a new game from Bend Studio, who created Days Gone in 2019. Although Days Gone was highly successful, with many fans wanting a sequel, it seems that they have chosen to avoid that route and have instead decided to work on a new IP, presumably with Sony's blessing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-seemingly-working-on-playstation-live-service-game/">Several job listings have surfaced online</a>, suggesting that Bend Studio's new IP will be a live-service title with the makings of the open-world systems that appeared in Days Gone. However, other than the job listings and some screenshots, there hasn't been much information to go on. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dkxvre/sony_bend_days_gone_studio_already_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported in 2019</a> that Studio Bend was already in pre-production for its next game, roughly six months after Days Gone had been released.</p>
<p>Since this information was covered, a new discovery has been made of an online portfolio of a UI designer who worked at Bend Studio from 2022 until March 2024. Their name has been protected, but their portfolio shows that they were working on an unannounced Bend Studio project and had several images in their portfolio that were seemingly concepts from the Bend project.</p>

<p>These images have been <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded to MP1st</a>, which showcases a Military style game, with a futuristic sci-fi feel to it. Admittedly, the images don't reveal much other than some of the UI elements, and weaponry that players would be able to access. There were some images of the overworld, but it wasn't fully developed yet, and didn't really show off anything that could be seen as significant.</p>
<p>As it's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-bend-studio-next-game-multiplayer-open-world-systems/">confirmed by Bend Studio</a> that there are going to be multiplayer elements and an open-world, the theme of a Military style game has potential, especially as it could play relatively similar to Days Gone, just without the zombies.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all speculation at the moment, and it could be that this information isn't relevant at all to the supposed new game in development. While The Game Awards will be taking place this weekend, it's hard to say whether a game like this will make an appearance.</p>

Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu also say that the agents can also “tap into Google Search to connect you with the wealth of gaming knowledge on the web.”</p><p>Google is testing the agents’ “ability to interpret rules and challenges” in games like <em>Clash of Clans</em> and <em>Hay Day </em>from Supercell<em>, </em>according to Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu.</p><p>I’m not surprised Google is chasing these ideas: in theory, an AI agent coaching you through a strategy or puzzle could be useful. It sounds like this work is very early, though, and I have many questions about whether or not these agents actually give sound advice.</p><p>Google is also investing in video games and AI in another way: creating playable virtual worlds on the fly from a prompt image using a “foundation world model” called Genie 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313409/a-google-ai-model-can-create-playable-virtual-worlds-on-the-fly">that it showed off last week</a>. That work seems early, too: Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for “up to a minute,” <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">Google says</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A player found a secret Balatro quest in Cyberpunk 2077, added in the game’s latest update 2.2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/balatro by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1hb9o5d/new_cyberpunk_2077_update_adds_balatro_sidequest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dirtygoodking</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/cyberpunk-2077-2/221017/news/cyberpunk-2077-players-discover-secret-quest-based-on-hit-indie-game-added-with-patch-22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the new Balatro quest for Cyberpunk 2077 will begin through a message from Jim B. This character will inform V about “a gang of rogue jokers” that have invaded Night City and are plotting and scheming to seize the city’s gambling scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as you get this message, the players are sent on a collection quest to round up all the Jokers across the city. Once you complete the hidden Balatro quest from Cyberpunk 2077’s patch 2.2, you will be rewarded with a new Joker shirt, and a set of Balatro cards will be displayed at your apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radek Grabowski, the Global PR director at CD Projekt Red, provided <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866824502988185901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">additional information</a> on the quest. Grabowski stated that he had already discussed with the quest design team at CDPR about bringing Balatro cards to Cyberpunk 2077. This was made possible thanks to the help of quest designer Maria Mazur and in-house artist <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866853584077459647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olgierd Ciszak</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles developer Monolith Soft is now a wholly-owned subsidy of Nintendo. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/company/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently acquired</a> the final outstanding shares of Monolith Soft. This comes 17 years after the company first purchased 80% of the shares from Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Prior to the full share purchase, Nintendo owned 96% percent of the shares. The first 80% came in 2007 while another 16% was purchased from Bandai Namco in 2011. The outstanding 4% were owned by company founders Hirohide Sugiura, Tetsuya Takahashi and Yasuyuki Honne.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when this transaction took place. However, as of <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/media/2024/02/monolithsoft_brochure2024-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">February 2024</a>, Sugiura, Takahashi, and Honne still owned 4% of the company. That means it clearly happened within the last handful of months.</p>



<p>As far as the future goes, it’s not expected that anything will change. Nintendo has had a controlling stake in the studio for years, and will likely continue on business as usual. What it means, though, is that for the first time since the company was founded in 1999, the original founders will have no official stake in it.</p>



<p>In addition to work on the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise, Monolith has provided support development to games such as Animal  Crossing: New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red is reciprocating the love Balatro showed Cyberpunk 2077 a couple of months ago by adding a quest based on the roguelike card game.

That led to CD Projekt Red global PR director Radek Grabowski revealing that the collaboration is official and part of a new in-game quest.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: "You liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro? What if we had Balatro cards in Cyberpunk 2077?"

                <p>Actor Rob Wiethoff famously portrayed John Marston in Rockstar's acclaimed 2010 Red Dead Redemption, and now he's starting a new project that is completely different and unexpected. Wiethoff, 48, has launched an OnlyFans, but it's not <em>that kind </em>of OnlyFans. After fans discovered he had an OnlyFans set up, Wietoff released a video responding to what he described as "panic" surrounding this.</p><p>"I have an OnlyFans page. I do," Wietoff told his 200,000 followers on Instagram in a video address. It costs $5/month to subscribe. Wiethoff's OnlyFans account will be focused on his own personal health journey as he looks to get lean and ripped.</p><p>"There will be nothing but me trying to get in shape. If you want to be part of that, you are welcome to join," he said. "I know what OnlyFans is. Not everything on there has to be that kind of content. That is not what my content is going to be. If you want to get ripped with an old-timer, sign up; that's it."</p><p>In addition to voicing John Marston in the original Red Dead, Wiethoff came back to play the character once again in Red Dead Redemption II, which is a prequel to the first game.</p><p>In other Red Dead news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-solid-pc-port-shows-how-red-dead-still-holds-up-in-2024/1100-6527663/" data-ref-id="1100-6527663">original game finally came to PC earlier this year with its Undead Nightmare expansion.</a> Rockstar Games is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is set for release in Fall 2025.

            <p>The Pokémon Company is teaming up with Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman for a "special project" due in 2027.</p>
<p>Though it's unclear exactly what the project will be, Aardman will be bringing its "unique style of storytelling to the Pokémon universe in brand-new adventures" - presumably a film or TV series.</p>
<p>Aardman is best known for its stop-motion Wallace and Gromit films, but has also dabbled in video games with Shaun the Sheep and Chicken Run spin-offs, as well as the BAFTA-nominated 11-11: Memories Retold set in WW1.</p>

<p>"This is a dream partnership for Pokémon," said Taito Okiura, VP of marketing and media at The Pokémon Company. "Aardman are masters of their craft, and we have been blown away by their talent and creativity. What we have been working on together ensures our global Pokémon fans are in for a treat!"</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour to be working with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokémon Company International</a> - we feel sincerely privileged to be trusted with bringing their characters and world to life in a brand-new way," added Sean Clarke, managing director of Aardman.</p>
<p>"Bringing together Pokémon, the world's biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting. Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world."</p><div>

            <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year, and the lovely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> lot are embracing the festive season and gifting us all with a Winter Wonder update.</p>
<p>This is a gift, so the update will be free for those who have completed Astro Bot. In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/?sf275746168=1">PlayStation blog</a> update, developer Team Asobi said it was the studio's way of saying thank you for all the kind words and support since Astro Bot's release back in September.</p>
<p>As for what is actually included, this update adds a new level for players to platform their way through, and yes, it has a wintery theme. Team Asobi is keeping further detail pretty schtum for now, as it says it wants to keep things as much of a surprise as possible. However, the developer has said to expect its snowy level to be filled  with "shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew".</p>

That's 2am on 13th December, for those of us on the chilly shores of Blighty (where I live, it was -8C last night and I am still defrosting).</p>
<p>Again, to access this Winter Wonder update, players will need to have completed Astro Bot. An internet connection is also required.</p>

			<p>ASTRO BOT is a game that took the world by storm when it was released, giving plenty of fun nods to the expansive history of PlayStation while you get to play as ASTRO BOT, who first made an appearance in The Playroom, with ASTRO BOT being a sequel to Astro's Playroom. It's now been confirmed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team ASOBI that a new free update will be released for ASTRO BOT on December 12 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET, which adds a little bit of content to the game. There will be a brand-new level for players to explore, as well as new special bots for you to rescue, much like you had to in the previous levels.</p>
<p>However, to be able to access this update, you need to have completed the game first. "Since we want it to remain a little surprise, we will not say too much, but you should expect a fun-filled level with shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew!" says Studio Director Nicolas Doucet.</p>
<p>While the update isn't as big as the previous one they added to the game, it's nice to see that they are still adding content to the game, especially due to how beloved it is. Across multiple award ceremonies, ASTRO BOT has been the receiver of awards and many nominations, with the game already winning five awards. The Game Awards will be taking place on Friday, where they are nominated for a whopping seven awards this year.</p>
<p>When it comes to the audience they had in mind for this update, it's been confirmed by Doucet that there is no sort of trickery and challenges involved, and it's just meant to be a good time had by all.</p>
<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike. So, no hair-pulling challenge this time! We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p>
<p>For more details about the update, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> post, which is where they announced the new content coming to the game.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golf-with-your-friends-2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golf-with-your-friends-2-brings-more-golf-madness-next-year.1057887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golf-with-your-friends-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 has announced&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 multiplayer minigolf game&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends</em>, and it's due out sometime next year.</p>

<p>While the first game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, development work on the sequel will be handled by UK-based developer Radical Forge. As you'd expect from a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses, new gameplay mechanics, and more.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/GolfWYF/status/1866845983797022820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on social media platform X</a>, Team17 and Radical Forge say the game will introduce cross-platform multiplayer, so you'll be able to play it with your friends no matter where they're playing, as well as a "cross-platform level editor" to help you share your crazy golf creations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=seuMr0kW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=_QwGfoK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses and more next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these features,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>&nbsp;will also bring a new "hazardous weather system" that sounds like it'll throw a spanner in the works, as well as "improved physics" and more. It sounds like this'll be exactly the kind of sequel you've been expecting if you're a fan of the first game.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new customization options for your golf balls, as well as rewards you can accrue through the game's XP system. It doesn't sound like it'll be a live-service game, though, so it's unlikely you'll need to pay real money to unlock anything.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give much away, but it should get you hyped to play another installment in this franchise.</p>




<p>If you want to check out the original&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends&nbsp;</em>ahead of the sequel's release, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431240/Golf_With_Your_Friends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/235061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/golf-with-your-friends/9N14G09PWG74" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/golf-with-your-friends-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

In <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Aardman-Team-Up-for-Exciting-Collaboration-Coming-2027">a press release</a> about the collaboration, TCP marketing and media VP Taito Okiura described it as “a dream partnership for Pokémon.” Aardman’s managing director Sean Clarke added that it was both a huge honor and privilege to be tasked with presenting the Pokémon world in a new way.</p><p>“Bringing together Pokémon, the world’s biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting,” Clarke said. “Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world.”</p><p>Aside from the projected release year, there aren’t all that many details about what the collaboration is or how we’ll be able to consume it. Clearly, stop-motion claymation will be involved, but what’s less obvious is whether this will end up being a movie, a series, or perhaps a game — which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">wouldn’t be a first for Aardman</a>. This sort of team-up makes a lot of sense for TCPi after the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a><em> </em>and surprise delights like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24017505/pokemon-concierge-review-netflix"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em>. </em>And the closer we get to 2027, it’s feels like there’s a very strong chance this will be something that has people buzzing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’re helping your team, sure. But who cares about them?! You’re about to drop a Hellstorm missile on the enemy position!</p><p>Of course, you can only equip three of the best scorestreaks in <em>Black Ops 6,</em> and choosing which selection out of the game’s arsenal proves difficult at first glance. Do you go loud with a rainstorm of missiles? Do you call in air support to watch your six? It’s a gamble!</p><p><br>So, let’s go over <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s best streaks to help you choose the best ones.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cef89c2cc908ac0109500c22e0c4fe53" data-recommend-id="image://cef89c2cc908ac0109500c22e0c4fe53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The A.G.R.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another season, another TOTY. The EA community picks their favorite eleven players for the men’s and women’s professional games each season, culminating in the best promo each game. EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo beckons, and we have everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ea-sports-fc-25-tactics-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 25</a> has a ton of promos each game. Gone are the days when Team of the Week is the main course from which to pull cards. Now, EA’s soccer titles have a new promo almost every week. But it doesn’t matter how cool the designs get or how special the cards are, there’s one promotion to rule them all—Team of the Year. </p>



<p>We are fast closing in on 2025, and TOTY kickstarts the year off with a bang. It doesn’t matter if this is your first TOTY or your tenth, check out the latest details regarding the promo.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ea-fc-25-toty-release-date">Do we Know the EA FC 25 TOTY Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>EA FC 24 was stacked. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is no official start date for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo; however, if we look at FIFA 23 and FC 24’s TOTY start dates, the first round of cards go into packs on the <strong>third Friday of January</strong>—although there are five Fridays in January 2025. So, you can probably expect to start your TOTY card hunt on either <strong>Friday, Jan. 17, 2025, or Friday, Jan. 24, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Goalkeeper and Defenders, Midfielders, or Attackers are released for a couple of days, then another position gets 48 hours to shine, and the final set of players goes last. After everyone gets their turn, it’s time for a week-long pack hunt as the entire Team of the Year is put into packs and crashes the market.</p>







<p>We expect the EA FC site to have a <strong>dedicated Team of the Year Promo Vote page</strong>—like every year—<strong>allowing you to vote for the eleven players you feel have earned their spot in the best XI</strong>.</p>



<p>A ton of nominees are decided before the official TOTY announcement. You have the difficult choice of choosing one player for every position, and this is done for the Men’s and Women’s TOTY. The winners are eventually announced, showing you who earned the much sought-after spots.</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-ea-fc-25-toty-nominees">Potential EA FC 25 TOTY Nominees</h2>



<p>It’s been another year of incredible football around Europe and the rest of the world. EA FC 25’s TOTY vote is expected to be fiercely contested, and this is only fair when you’re dealing with potential game-breaking cards rated 95, 96, 97, and maybe higher!</p>



<p>Here are our predictions for who we think is in contention for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toem-2-promises-more-monochrome-photography-shenanigans.1057851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish studio Something We Made has announced&nbsp;<em>Toem 2</em>, a followup to its 2021 monochromatic photography puzzler, and it's currently in the very early stages of development.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the game right now, but Something We Made is promising a "brand new adventure" that's all about "documenting the world's little wonders", so it sounds very much like the sequel will be following in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/toem" rel="nofollow">the original game</a>'s footsteps.</p>

<p>It looks like <i>Toem 2</i>'s visual style will also be an upgrade over the original; while it'll sport the same monochromatic color scheme, the graphics seem to have been improved, and it seems as though the new game will adopt a more traditional 3D perspective as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=BFcetWiX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=-z3YFmQt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>looks like it's taking a slightly different visual direction to the original.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "uncovering little details" in the game's world, and you'll also be "helping friends along the way", so it sounds like you'll be taking on photography requests just like in&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>yet; Something We Made says the game is in very early development right now, so it could be a few years before we hear from this one again.</p>

<p>While you wait, you can check out the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It shows off what the game's art style will be like, but (understandably given the game's stage of development) it doesn't give too much away beyond that.</p>




<p>If you didn't check out the original&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>, it was a low-key cozy photography game in which you took on a variety of tasks given to you by a range of quirky characters.</p>

<p>The original game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM_A_Photo_Adventure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/toem/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/toem/9n7zcllr01b3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/toem-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

But another thing it is, on PC at least, is buggy. I’ve had a bunch of freezes, which suck, but worst was the moment when companion Gina just refused to follow her script, and my game—which offers no way to manually save—was softlocked. But, it turns out, there’s a rather hidden feature that got me out of trouble!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Searching around on the worldwide information superhighway, I know I’m not alone in hitting an issue with Gina’s AI in the Collapsed Hall section within Gizeh. While I’ve seen posts from others reporting it occurring in slightly different sections of the level, the problem remains the same: she just refuses to budge, and therefore doesn’t trigger an obligatory sequence of dialogue that’s required to let you continue. And that sucks too. </p><p>It sucks even more that without a quicksave, nor even a manual save (why? <em>why?!</em>), the bug was locked in already at the point the game had last saved for me. Jumping into a pit caused Gina to wake from her stupor and wail at my demise, but then she was back, catatonic, staring at a wall when I miraculously revived. I felt completely stuck, no way to get out of this pickle. Until I saw mention of a “rollback” option.

The standard pause screen has an option to “Restart Checkpoint,” which is useless if you’re in a similar situation. However, if you instead choose the bizarrely titled “Quit Game,” which does in fact <em>not</em> quit the game but takes you back to the main menu, you’ll see an option called “Game Slots.”</p><p>Yes, I know, that’s the section for picking which of the three concurrent versions of the game you want to play in, and yet, yes, this is where the secret is hidden. It’s like finding an ancient artefact in a mysterious tomb! Because tucked away at the bottom-left of the screen is text that opaquely says, “Save Rollback.” </p><p>This odd terminology hides a little menu that contains the three previous checkpoint saves that occurred before the current one (there’s no clear explanation of this, but none of them is the most recent), letting you jump back in time to an earlier moment. The times they’re labeled with are not clock times, but rather indicate how long you’d been playing, so you’ll be able to see how many minutes of progress you’re about to lament repeating—in my particular case it was only about five minutes, although it involved solving a boring mirror puzzle for a second time, complete with unskippable cutscenes.</p><hr><p>I’m so relieved this feature is in the game, given otherwise I’d have lost 10 hours of progress and likely never bothered playing again. But it remains a mystery greater than any Indy ever investigated why you can’t just manually save for yourself.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the souls-like game from Nexon, has had its release date leaked by the reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-de-nouvelles-informations-sur-le-jeu-the-first-berserker-khazan-59763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>According to the leaker, the game will be released on March 27, 2025. He also said that the official announcement will be made tomorrow at The Game Awards 2024. Pre-orders will start immediately after the event.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the game will be sold 10 dollars lower than usual, going for U$60. I had the opportunity to test a closed beta of the game and I had the impression that the title was ready for release.</p>



<p>During my playthrough, all I got was the feeling that it needs some slight balancing adjustments, given that some enemies can destroy the protagonist with two hits. The bosses, even the initial ones, were extremely challenging, and I’m a veteran of the genre. It’s a similar feeling to the first NiOh, with the first demo on the beach.</p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is set in the DNF universe. As the subtitle suggests, the game stars Khazan, a legendary general who ended up being betrayed by the Empire. The narrative sets the general on a journey of revenge.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled for release on PS5, PC and Xbox Series. Unlike other Nexon games, this title will be single-player focused.</p>

                <p>Pokemon and Aardman are teaming up for... something.

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now on PC and Xbox, but could MachineGames come back for a sequel or a different Indiana Jones game in the future?

He stopped short of saying if MachineGames or another studio could make a new Indiana Jones game, however.</p><p>"Right now, we're focused on getting this one to the public and getting to the DLC and making this as successful as we can," Reilly said of the game and its upcoming The Order of Giants expansion. "I think we're always looking for great stories.

Crusade, in the year 1937. Players take on the iconic role of Indiana Jones as they try to stop evil forces from obtaining a power known as The Great Circle.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_video_games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lots of Indiana Jones video games over the years</a>, and The Great Circle is the first title for console since Lego Indiana Jones 2 in 2011.</p><p>Also in the interview, Reilly shared more insight on how Lucasfilm interacts with game developers working on its properties. "We don't tell the teams how to run development. We don't tell them how to run their day-to-day of the business," he said.</p><p>For The Great Circle, Lucasfilm was involved in making sure the game "looks, feels, [and] sounds like Indiana Jones," and that included approving the casting of Troy Baker as Indiana Jones himself.</p><p>"Between the work MachineGames did in representing him physically and the absolutely stunning work Troy has done voicing the character, you forget it's not Harrison when you play it. He's that good," Reilly said.</p><p>Whether or not another Indiana Jones game from MachineGames or anyone else gets made likely has to do, in part, with the commercial success of The Great Circle. Microsoft doesn't typically announce sales numbers, and the fact that The Great Circle is also on Game Pass doesn't make it easy to understand how the game is performing. On Steam, The Great Circle is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as a top-seller </a>and has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2677660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached 12,000 concurrent players there</a>. It is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/top-paid/games/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not inside the top 500 games on Xbox's top paid games list</a>, but there are plenty of reasons for why this could be.</p><p>The Great Circle began development prior to Microsoft's acquisition of MachineGames via its buyout of parent company ZeniMax. Making The Great Circle exclusive to Xbox at launch is expected to amount to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost sales</a>, Microsoft has said. The Great Circle is scheduled to come to PS5 in Spring 2025.</p>

			<p>A new Donkey Kong Country Returns HD trailer has been released by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-series-developer-monolith-soft-is-now-fully-owned-by-nintendo/">Nintendo</a>, and it showcases some of the content that players can expect from this nostalgic journey. This game was originally released on both the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo 3DS, with the 3DS having extra levels. In this new visually-enhanced version of the game, those levels will be included, and as a result, there are 80 levels across nine different worlds for players to explore. For those interested in getting this game, it will be available on Nintendo Switch on January 16, 2025. For a glimpse into what's to come, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="A barrelful of details on Donkey Kong Country Returns HD! (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skNFOPOiyYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game has lots of fun details for those who are completionists, as there are secrets and collectibles to gather, as well as a Time Attack medal, which will require the player to be quick on their feet, especially when it comes to facing off against the boss battles at the end of each world.</p>
<p>Much like many other Donkey Kong games, players will also be able to play this game in local co-ops, allowing you to play with a friend or family member, where your teammate can play as Diddy Kong and give you a helping hand.&nbsp; By having Diddy Kong help you out, you will be able to utilize his jet pack, which can be used for some of the more challenging jumps in the game, as well as to fight off enemies using his peanut popgun.</p>
<p>When the game was first released for the Nintendo Wii, it was proven to be quite challenging. In this remastered version of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, you will have the option to choose between Classic Mode, which is the difficulty it was at originally, or playing using Modern Mode if you need a bit of a helping hand and want an easier experience.</p>
<p>Of course, it's completely up to you whether you play this game solo or with a friend, and you are still able to succeed just using Donkey Kong's Ground Pound and Barrel Roll.</p>
<p>For those interested, you<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooFtowm_VZ2XeH0f79at3njXQb3iRlhA9zoLIZEmBbGY991JSvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> can currently pre-order the game</a> now for a price of $59.99, with the game set to release on January 16, 2025.</p>
