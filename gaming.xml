<hr>
<p>Did you know there was a U-turn jump in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>? I just realised this morning! He does a roll jump (that can be chained into another air roll) and lands with a sonar splash. I'm not exactly sure how useful it is but it's an expressive delight just to discover and do, and really that's the whole game?</p>
<p>Other things I’ve only realised in the post-game: Kong Bananza's charge punch sends a shockwave projectile that tunnels through stone with <strong>Dragon Ball</strong>-ish delight; You get more airtime with the spin jump when holding a chunk in hand, helicoptering down like a sycamore seed; You can turn off Pauline's singing for the Bananzas in the settings, which I'm a little torn on - it's a relief to maintain Level Vibes Unbroken without those noisy earworms, but I do also love getting to get to the elephant’s middle eight (shake your, shake your body!).</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4zpgjkh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Also, it turns out you can be so Bananza-pilled that you get oddly excited by the wet clumps of sand in the construction site next to your gym?</p>
<p>And now that we’ve all had a chance to bed into Bananza, shall we stop with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> comparisons? Now we have both! The poise and solidity of Odyssey and the freeform painterly pulverising of DK. Both games revel in the music of movement - and how brilliant this new instrument is.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think the game is like eating. For Donkey Kong it literally is, as he munches through ever more crystal Banandium. But also for us, as we punch through the world just for the tactile pleasure of it. It feels less like depleting the environment so much as tasting its textures, like the just-so powdery snow or the <em>thwunk</em> of cracking through coloured concrete to sapphire glinting beneath. I’m a big fan of the light plectrum <em>twang</em> in the pad as you climb metallic surfaces, and surely everyone loves the summer squelch of tunnelling through watermelons in the Resort Layer.</p>
<p>The game just says 'Yes' to everything! Bejewelled Zebras happily carry on chatting in a pit you’ve carved below the village they were just in. A fractone butler’s pieces punch away with xylophone notes. And of all the sounds in the game, that <em>thwack</em> of the slap as you high-five one of the burrowing eels? It’s practically physical. Surely no other game has doubled down so much on breaks and cracks and grabbing and grasping as a sort of mode of engagement? Like that unthinking pinching as you walk through TK Maxx just testing the feel of the fabrics. Like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">ICO</a>’s Yorda hand-hold, but the whole darn level. And with more punching.</p>
<p>Then you combine this with <em>ridiculous</em> flow and fluidity. The roll jump leads into that big lolopping leap, the ground-grab happens seamlessly without missing a beat, and the plunging plummet punch can be released into a featherlight landing. For a big boy, DK can be outstandingly nimble, making for a brilliantly unique gameflow where the whole game becomes DK Artist, moving and doodling through the environments leaving scuffs and patches in your wake. Then punching a purple shark that curves away in a rainbow arc.</p>
<figure><a title="Finding this place made me unreasonably happy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/922d068da16a3/finding-this-place-made-me-unreasonably-happy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Finding this place made me unreasonably happy — <em>Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, back to Odyssey. I get all the comparisons, it’s from the same team after all. And it's a useful way to compare and contrast to better see what Bananza is doing differently - an understood lingua franca (because basically everyone loves Odyssey).</p>
<p>But Bananza takes longer to hit its stride, then sprints, then flies. I thought it was peaking with a dig-down shanty town, but <em>then</em> there were sunlight fights in shatter-glass corridors (you’ll know it when you get to it). And it turns out it hadn’t even gotten <em>crazy</em> crazy. And now I’m loving the post-game and all its teachings about moves and Bananzas I thought I knew.</p>
<p>But even that’s not the point. Like Odyssey before it, I'll probably have Bananza installed for most of my Switch 2's life, even having gobbled through the outrageously moreish campaign (well done Nintendo for the enjambment of chucking my Bananas down the next hole!), even when I’ve rinsed the post-game for all its trinkets. Because I really love the post-post game, where the game’s earned your affection and now all the play and messing about is just doing reps of delight. When it’s just a texture of play that you have at hand for when you fancy.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’ll fancy Odyssey’s move-chaining and pinpoint precision, the spring off a car in New Donk City or the squeak of an Uproot jump in Wooded Kingdom - its very <em>definite</em> gamefeel in general. Other times, I’ll load up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> for that weightier momentum and rocketing triple jump. And now I’ve got Bananza for when I want this mad, Dubai-Chocolate game of gaudiness and gold and crunch and chunks, where walls and floors aren’t obstacles but just the sea in which DK swims (punches).</p>
<p>Which is the level I’ll most come back to in Bananza, I wonder? At first I thought it’d be the Jungle Layer with its dark-green and jungle drums, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> vibes, and that brilliant feeling of throwing a seed and jumping early just as air turns to vine.</p>
<p>But then it just got better.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a new turn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/715299/itchio-games-delisting-payment-processor-paypal">in the itch.io story</a>. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">In a forum post</a>, itch.io creator and founder Leaf Corcoran has notified users that the company has begun the process of restoring thousands of NSFW pages that were deindexed — that is, content that has been removed from search results and recommendation lists. The catch is that in order for deindexed content to be restored, it has to be listed as free. This is ostensibly because there can be no objection from payment processors if there are no payments being processed for prohibited material.</p><p>“Today, we are re-indexing free adult NSFW content,” Corcoran wrote. He went on to explain that the company is actively working to restore paid NSFW content, but that will take some time. “We are still in ongoing discussions with payment processors and will be re-introducing paid content slowly to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term.”</p><p>The itch.io adult content ban began last week, with the indie storefront announcing that it had <a href="https://itch.io./updates/update-on-nsfw-content">mass deindexed all content labeled as “NSFW” or “adult”</a> in the face of mounting pressure from the site’s payment processors. That pressure, Corcoran said, is what caused the rather abrupt and disruptive action that resulted in over 20,000 pages containing games, books, comics, artwork, and more being deindexed virtually overnight and with no advance communication.</p><p>“To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance,” Corcoran wrote in the original announcement.</p><p>Since then, itch.io creators and more have mounted <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal">a massive pushback campaign</a>, calling up payment processors like Visa and Mastercard demanding they let itch.io conduct business as usual. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Mastercard’s senior vice president of communications, Seth Eisen, denied allegations that it is essentially censoring its client, writing:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations. Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.”</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>“Visa does not discriminate against legal transactions. Some merchants, such as adult content or gambling sites that operate legally, face an elevated risk of illegal activity, and we require enhanced safeguards for acquirers supporting merchants in these industries.”</p></blockquote></div><p>In the meantime, Corcoran said that Stripe, one of itch.io’s payment processors for over 10 years, will not support NSFW content at all, but added that itch.io is working to find new business partners.</p><p>“We are in the process of talking with other payment partners to accept card payments that Stripe is unable to process,” Corcoran wrote. “Our long-term plan is to implement one or more new processors to avoid putting the platform at risk.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/717393/itchio-adult-content-ban-restoring-free-nsfw-pages]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124"><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i></a> has a sizable roster of skaters to choose from. Whether you choose from the 29 that are immediately available or go with an unlockable skater like <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Magera</a>, each one feels different thanks to a unique layout of stats.</p> <p>That might be a problem if someone you like doesn’t play as comfortably as you want. Fortunately, collectible Stat points in each level can be used to upgrade everyone on the roster. So let’s go over every stat’s purpose and which ones you should invest in first.</p> <h2>What each stat means</h2> <p>Anyone new to this series is bound to feel a little lost from the onslaught of terms and actions. There is a lot to remember from the tutorial, and ten skater stats don’t help in that regard. Here’s an explanation for what each stat determines:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Air:</b> The maximum height you get from jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hangtime:</b> How long you can stay in the air after jumping off a half pipe</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Ollie:</b> How high you jump while on flat ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Speed:</b> The maximum speed you can reach on the ground</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Spin:</b> How fast you spin while in the air</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Switch:</b> Affects how well you skate in the alternate stance</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Flip Speed:</b> How quickly flip tricks turn</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rail Balance:</b> The stability of the grinding rail meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Lip Balance:</b> The stability of the Lip Trick meter</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Manual Balance:</b> The stability of the Manual meter</li> </ul> <h2>What are the best stats to prioritize?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614382"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614382">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With such a wide variety of tricks and options, every player will skate a bit differently. This is more apparent once we factor in all of the different maps. Nevertheless, some stats are more useful when you’re starting out.</p> <p><b>If you’re unsure what stats to prioritize putting points into, we suggest focusing on Air, Speed, and Rail Balance.</b> Being able to move faster and jump higher off half pipes will make a huge difference on their own, but we can’t discount how nice it feels to grind rails more easily. Manual Balance and Hangtime are some great alternate choices if the Skater you’re using already has high values in the other stats.</p>

 <p>Something else worth pointing out is that point allocation isn’t set in stone. You can remove any added points and redistribute them to your heart’s content. All you need to do is pause the game, switch over to the Skater tab with R1/RB, and then select the Stats box to edit them. This can even be done in the middle of a run, which is great if you need to readjust for a competition level or need a bit more Speed to get a Secret Tape.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Just weeks after the very successful release of College Football 26, EA Sports is coming right back to professional football with Madden 26, and its release date is rapidly approaching. There's a lot to know about the next Madden game, as EA has made some crucial changes to core elements of the gameplay experience. These include alterations to Franchise Mode, improved mechanics, and overall quality-of-life changes that fans have been asking for.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you officially get your hands on Madden 26, though, there are a few important pieces of information you'll want to know. After all, how are you going to play if you don't know when the game is launching or what editions are being offered? Below, you can see the early access and worldwide release date for Madden 26, how to preorder one of its editions,, and some of the key changes EA has made in its latest installment of the famed franchise.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Madden_26_be_released_">When will Madden 26 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, you don't have to wait too much longer to boot up EA's newest football game. After being formally announced in April, Madden 26 is officially launching on August 14. However, if you preorder a specific edition of the game, then you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-madden-nfl-26-a-full-7-days-early/1100-6533480/">receive up to seven days of early access. </a></p><p dir="ltr">The early access release date allows players who are willing to spend a little extra money to gain a headstart. The entire game is open and playable during the early access period, including Madden Ultimate Team. Early access players will also be able to complete special Early Access Solo Challenges, which aren't available to other players.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1324331004" data-promo-id="0"

you can start playing right when the game launches, you'll want to preorder an edition. Preordering allows you to pre-download Madden 26 before it releases, and as mentioned, can get you early access if you preorder the correct version.</p><p dir="ltr">On any platform, you can preorder Madden 26 by going to your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, EA App). You can also visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official Madden 26 website</a> and place your preorder by following the steps on the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to preorder, you'll need to pick an edition to buy. For lots more, be sure to consult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-preorder-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-xbox-series-x-amazon-walmart/1100-6531099/">GameSpot's Madden 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">If you already own College Football 26, you'll want to stick with the Madden 26 Deluxe Edition, as the main draw of the MVP Bundle is that it also includes a copy of CFB 26. You can also preorder the Madden 26 Standard Edition for some extra content, but you won't get early access with your purchase.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_Madden_26_trailer_here">Watch the Madden 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about seeing some gameplay of Madden 26 before you decide to make a purchase, or to just build your hype a bit, you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ">official trailer</a> for the game below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer, which was released on June 4, showcases some of the new content coming to the game, including cover athlete Saquon Barkley's backwards jump mechanic. However, if you're interested in Franchise Mode, we recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV4VXk6CG98&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">Franchise Deep Dive trailer</a> for Madden 26. This offers an in-depth look at all of the changes EA has made to the mode.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Madden_26_platforms">Madden 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Madden 26 is arriving on all major platforms that one might expect in 2025. You can play the football game on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time that a Madden game has arrived on a Nintendo Switch console. With the recent release of the Switch 2, EA is making use of the upgraded technology of the console to make Madden 26 playable. If you want to see how Madden 26 plays on the Switch 2, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/">early preview of the game on the console</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're going to play on PC, you have the option of playing on Steam, Epic Games, or the EA App for Windows. The PC platform you use doesn't make a huge difference, so pick whichever one you're more comfortable with. However, the EA App often discounts the Madden games before and after they are released, so going through that platform could mean a slight price reduction for you.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Madden_26_gameplay_changes">Madden 26 gameplay changes</h2><p dir="ltr">As you might expect with a new Madden game, the core gameplay experience is remaining the same in Madden 26. Franchise Mode, Madden Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode, and Quick Play are all coming back to give you a variety of different ways to play. All 32 NFL teams and all of the players on those teams will be included and playable, just like any other year, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Madden 26 is changing up its game modes in several ways and has also added some new gameplay mechanics. The highlight of these mechanics is the backwards jump made famous by Eagles running back Saquon Barkley in a 2024 regular season game. Player movement as a whole has also been changed in Madden 26, offering a snappier and more explosive feel. Be careful not to get trucked, though, as EA has added more physics-based interactions to make collisions more realistic.</p><p dir="ltr">On the field in Madden 26, you'll see more team- and fan-specific elements than ever. These include special team art, fan traditions, and special stadium anthems to make you feel like you're really attending an NFL game. All 32 NFL teams have been taken into account, so no matter where you play, you'll see some kind of unique element.</p><p dir="ltr">Franchise Mode has been updated in a few major ways in Madden 26. You can now choose one of four Coach Archetypes before starting the mode if you create your own coach, which is something College Football 26 fans are familiar with. These Coach Archetypes can then be upgraded with new abilities as you progress with your Franchise. Abilities change how your coach operates and what strengths they have access to. You can customize all aspects of your coaching style with these abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Franchise Mode still offers the chance to take control of your favorite NFL head coach if you want their specific strengths. NFL head coaches still have access to the new abilities, but now, your coordinators matter more than ever. If you design or pick an offensive-minded head coach, you'll want more input from a good defensive coordinator on a week-to-week basis. Speaking of which, Franchise Mode now offers Weekly Gameplans, which can be used to meticulously plan for an upcoming opponent. You can read <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/madden-26-gridiron-notes-franchise-deep-dive" rel="nofollow ">EA's Franchise Deep Dive blog</a> for more details on the mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542040-screenshot2025-08-01at8.51.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542040" data-ratio="0.56155143338954" data-width="1186" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542040-screenshot2025-08-01at8.51.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542040"></a><figcaption>Madden NFL 26 is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542040-screenshot2025-08-01at8.51.45am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Finally, Madden 26 is once again changing some parts about its Superstar Mode, which acts as the "story" mode in Madden 26 and allows you to create your own player and rise through the ranks of the NFL. Like last year, Madden 26 allows you the ability to transfer your College Football 26 Road to Glory players into Superstar Mode, giving you the chance to continue using your created players.</p><p dir="ltr">Superstar Mode also now features Career Chapters for more progression and added consequences to your actions. You can use the Sphere of Influence in conjunction with the Career Chapters to see how your player is performing in the eyes of the coaches and fans. It all seems very intuitive and should provide Superstar players with added layers of depth during their playthroughs. You can read more about those systems and the other changes in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/madden-26-gridiron-notes-superstar-deep-dive" rel="nofollow ">Superstar Mode in EA's blog</a>.</p>

<p>Set in the world of the popular tabletop role-playing game, Starfinder, this new adventure includes new characters, each with their own unique story lines, and brings Starfinder's second edition ruleset to the digital world for the first time.</p>



<p>Epictellers Entertainment will be working in collaboration with Starfinder's creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathfinder-kingmaker-crpg-chris-avellone/">Paizo</a>, on the project, but Epictellers will be the ones both publishing and leading development on the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re thrilled to unveil Starfinder: Afterlight in partnership with Paizo,</em>" said Epictellers Entertainment co-founder and chief executive officer, Ricard Pillosu, in a press release. "<em>This marks the beginning of a journey we want to take alongside Starfinder fans everywhere. We can’t wait to share more about the ragtag crew navigating the Pact Worlds, full of danger and adventure."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>For Paizo's part, publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, added, "<em>Starfinder’s universe is rich, vast, and beloved</em>. <em>Epictellers Entertainment's vision aligns perfectly with the essence of our galaxy. We believe they’re the ideal team to bring this next chapter of the franchise to life.</em>"</p>

<p>Afterlight will have you assemble six companions for your journey, each fitting into one of six categories for the turn-based fights: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. You'll travel to multiple locations in the universe and engage in a narrative-focused adventure where the choices you make will impact the outcome of the game.</p>



<p>Another interesting tidbit is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Neil Newbon</a>, the actor who many will know from <a href="https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and most recently from Surgent Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/">Dead Take</a>, is directing the voice cast.</p>



<p>Today's announcement and screenshots have provided a good foundation for what Afterlight could become, but the real test is always the first view of live gameplay. Hopefully, we'll be able to check some gameplay footage before the end of the year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/improve-your-rimworld-odyssey-experience-with-these-excellent-quality-of-life-mods.1259820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>RimWorld </i>has come a long way since its initial launch in November of 2013. Back then, a lot of what made the game great today was simple and barebones. Through regular content updates and multiple expansions, the team at Ludeon Studios has crafted one of the greatest story-generating colony sim games in this niche genre. But it’s the modding community that carries the torch forward. They’ve introduced the community to total overhauls, eyebrow-raising inclusions, and, of course, the ever-beloved quality of life mods. Let’s explore a few of those that many of us long-time players can’t do without!</p> <h2>Neat Storage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614367">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / seobungzu</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the earliest rooms you’ll construct for your base—or, at the very least, that you should construct—is a storage room for everything you brought in the crash landing. If left outside in the weather and the fauna, your packaged food will quickly deteriorate. But no one wants to walk over junk on the floor, right?</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416243474&amp;searchtext=neat+storage">Neat Storage</a> enables clean, aesthetically pleasing storage solutions for everything from raw resources to clothing to weapons to body parts. The shelves are simply, <i>mwah</i>, gorgeous to look at.</p>

 <h2>Character Editor</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614368">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / VOID</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll encounter a wide variety of pawns during the creation process, most of which feature an abundance of quirks, high and low skills, passions, and even injuries. It’s random, and you could very easily get screwed over by the in-game character generator.</p> <p>If you’d rather have a little more agency over your colony, a tool like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874644848&amp;searchtext=character+editor">Character Editor</a> will allow you to completely resculpt a pawn into anything you desire. From a pyromaniac god-like character with maxed out abilities to a child warrior turned scientist incapable of cleaning or menial labor, it’s all up to you now!</p>

 <h2>Smarter Construction</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614369">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / Hultis</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s be honest with ourselves, pawns in <i>RimWorld </i>aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. Sure, they’ll satiate their basic needs if left to their own devices, but for everything else, you need to take an active hand in ordering them about. If you want something built, it’s up to your planning expertise. Need a food source, yep, it’s up to you.</p> <p>Pawns tend to construct entire structures randomly, sometimes leading to roof collapses that wipe out whole colonies or trapping a pawn inside an airless room. With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773&amp;searchtext=smarter+construction">Smarter Construction</a>, those mishaps are a thing of the past. They’ll build smart, leaving paths open for trapped pawns, and construct walls and supports in such a way that solidifies the building.</p>

 <h2>Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614370">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / FrozenSnowFox</figcaption></figure> <p>Occasionally, as in rarely, I’ll play a peaceful colony that focuses on farming, ranching, or selling crafted resources like a merchant. But more often than not, <i>RimWorld </i>devolves into its usual dangerous, destructive planetary war as always. When a fight happens, all the blood, mud, and scorch marks remain until you send out your pawns to clean the place.</p> <p>But not anymore! With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791&amp;searchtext=filth+vanishes+with+rain+and+time">Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</a>, the next time those rain clouds appear overhead, they’ll help cleanse the land and leave your settlers feeling content and devoid of dirty, germ-ridden thoughts.</p> <h2>Color Coded Mood Bar</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614371">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / CrashM / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every minor and major incident in the game affects your pawn’s disposition. From a lack of food to too few recreational devices to a raid to discovering an underground network of tunnels leading to the ultimate bug hive beneath your base, your pawns will either roll with the punches or roll on the floor. But you can’t take steps to help them overcome such challenges with a clear head if you don’t understand their mood better.</p>

 <p>Sure, you could just go into the mood tab of their character HUD, but who has time for that? With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006605356">Color Coded Mood Bar</a>, a glance at the top of the screen will tell you everything you need to know. If your pawn’s portrait is red, look out!</p>  <hr> <p><i>RimWorld </i>is available now on Windows PCs, and its latest expansion, <i>Odyssey</i>, launched on July 11.</p>

		<p>Nintendo have announced that the price of the original Switch consoles and accessories will be changing this weekend in the United States. While they do not explicitly state that the price is going to increase, if the price was to be reduced they would be shouting about it, so it’s easy to read between the lines and this is a price hike.</p>
<p>Here’s the text from Nintendo.</p>


<p><em>“Pricing for the original Nintendo Switch™ family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.”</em></p>
<p>I have been writing video games news for a very long and I think this is the first time a legacy console has had a price increase, rather than a decrease. Some US retailers have already changed their prices, adding $40-$50 to the price of a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>As for why the prices are being increased, it’s fairly obvious. The consoles are made outside the US and that means <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cpqvdxzwv22t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tarrifs.</a></p>
<p>The price increase may have little impact as everyone seems to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-huge-new-console-sales-record-in-its-first-month/">buying a Switch 2.&nbsp;</a>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process – they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles,</p>

<p>Onto hardware now, and it's a pretty familiar picture. The Switch 2 is once again head and shoulders above the competition, despite numbers falling a little since last week. Nintendo's latest put up an additional 92,013 sales this time, with the regional total edging ever closer to the big two milly.</p>
<p>The Switch OLED and Lite models have outsold the PS5 once again, though the numbers pale in comparison to those from the successor as more and more people decide to make the switch to Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be raising the prices of all of the original Nintendo Switch models, plus certain accessories for the console, this weekend.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official Nintendo website, prices for all three console models will be raised "based on market conditions". Just as a reminder, that includes the original Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite, plus "select Nintendo Switch accessories", although Nintendo doesn't specify which ones.</p>

<p>Additionally, "certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo" will also see price increases. Nintendo hasn't revealed by how much the prices for these products will rise, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-price-hike-alarmo.jpg?itok=ytnZPRqS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-price-hike-alarmo.jpg?itok=8_Bg-V9b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just the Switch that's getting a price hike.</figcaption></figure><p>Intriguingly, the Switch 2 won't be hit with the same price rise. It's likely that since the console has just been released, Nintendo wants to build up a larger player base before it ratchets up the price of the new machine.</p>

<p>The company does, however, say that it may be necessary to adjust Switch 2 prices in future. I'd imagine that whether this happens or not is contingent on whether President Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l6g13rlwko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">increases tariffs or introduces new ones</a>, and since these things can be unpredictable at the best of times, Nintendo is playing its cards close to its chest for now.</p>

<p>While Nintendo doesn't overtly state that it's raising Switch prices due to tariffs, it's almost certainly the reason behind the hike. Nintendo has moved a lot of its manufacturing to Vietnam, a country that's just had 20% tariffs imposed on its exports to the US, and (as is often the way of tariffs) the company is likely passing that cost on to the consumer for its older console.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the original announcement of sweeping tariffs on a number of countries delayed the Switch 2's pre-order date <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">a couple of months ago</a>. Various industry bodies, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">the ESA</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">Game Manufacturers Association</a> (on the tabletop side), have decried the introduction of tariffs, claiming that they'll have a hugely detrimental impact on the gaming industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Itch.io, the indie gaming store<a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841"> that recently pulled all NSFW games from its site</a>, is beginning the process of “re-indexing” adult games. At the moment, this is only affecting free games, and the site is still in discussions with payment providers over how it can return paid-for NSFW games without facing penalization.</p> <p>This all came about after an Australian anti-porn pressure group, Collective Shout, campaigned payment providers to stop working with gaming stores that sold games of which it did not approve. First, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391">Valve removed hundreds of adult games from Steam</a>, while introducing new and incredibly ambiguous rules about what was acceptable. Then soon after, Itch followed suit, but in a far more dramatic fashion, de-listing any game marked as “adult” or “not safe for work” from the store’s searchable pages. In the process, large numbers of games that in no way contravened even the most broad notions of acceptability were caught in the crossfire, and inevitably many of them were representing LGBTQ+ subjects.</p> <p>Now, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">has released a statement</a> saying the store is bringing back free NSFW games, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors,” meaning paid games will be reintroduced “slowly.”</p> <p>To get an NSFW game back on Itch today, developers must check the “No payments” box on their dashboard, making their game not only free, but also unable to accept optional payments from customers. Itch’s excellent systems usually allows customers to pay the asking price for a game, or opt to pay more if they wish. That allows developers to price their games as free but still receive payments from those who want to. That’s currently unavailable for any adult games.</p> <p>Leaf’s post explains that Itch spoke with its primary payment provider Stripe, with which it’s worked for a decade, and has been told they will “not be able to” take payments for “content designed for sexual gratification.” That ludicrously ambiguous phrase is helpful to precisely no one, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34">Rule 34</a> and the infinite reaches of kink. However, Stripe does seem to be making some progressive noises. The company asked Itch to share a statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>Itch says as a result of this it’s now speaking to other payment processors to try to find a company that can cover what Stripe will not. In the meantime, NSFW games that do not violate Stripe’s current definition of unacceptability will be reviewed and possibly re-listed.</p> <p>The situation, no matter anyone’s opinion on the nature of the games being disallowed, remains deeply concerning. We are seeing multiple stores explaining to customers that their actions are now dependent upon what payment processors will tolerate, given any online store can be held to ransom by these corporations. If you cannot process a payment, you can’t sell a game, and it’s all or nothing. Thanks to the efforts of these ideologically driven pressure groups, companies like Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and the rest fear being associated with controversial adult content, and will simply refuse to work with stores that don’t adhere to their unclear and ever-changing limits. In other words, the moralities of a pressure group dictate the nature of what can be sold on a gaming store, because of the pusillanimous nature of the corporations in the middle.</p>

<p>While this anti-cheat software has proven to be particularly effective, it's not foolproof and it's only a matter of time before cheat-makers find a way around it. Respawn Entertainment CEO and Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella acknowledged this issue, comparing it to an "arms race" as developers are constantly working on improving their anti-cheat technology while cheat-makers continue to discover exploits in games.</p><p>"It's a weird one because you don't want to talk about what you're doing as it gives people who are trying to cheat a headstart against you," Zampella said to <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q" rel="nofollow ">Gaming Interviews</a>. "It's a huge thing in the industry; in gaming, it's a constant arms race that we're always putting a lot of effort into. It is something that we would stamp out completely if we could. To the day we die, we will be fighting it."</p><p>Players looking to try out an early slice of the game won't have to wait long, as the Battlefield 6 limited access open beta kicks off on August 7 and then opens up to everyone else starting August 9.

That's a lot of consoles in a short time. As such, the company noted that "demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers." Nintendo aims to "strengthen our production and supply systems" to address the issue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In May, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">believed Switch 2 supply would meet demand in the US</a>. This was obviously weeks before the console launched but echoed Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa's thoughts that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/">price point would be a bigger factor in early hardware sales</a>. For comparison, Microsoft and Sony struggled with Xbox Series X and PS5 supply for almost a year after launch. However, those systems also came out in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">But then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 became the fastest-selling home console ever</a>, moving 3.5 million units in four days. The system helped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-helps-shatter-a-us-hardware-june-sales-record-that-stood-for-17-years-circana/1100-6533373/">shatter a US hardware June sales record</a> that stood for almost two decades, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/">original Switch family of systems will be seeing price increases</a> in the US in a matter of days. Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch Online memberships won't be affected at this time, but that could change in the future. Certain Switch 2 accessories will cost more, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo announced this morning that a number of its products' prices are changing beginning August 3. Specifically, the OLED Switch model, standard Switch model, Switch Lite, Switch accessories, certain Switch 2 accessories, some Amiibo, and Alarmo will be receiving price changes.</p><p>In its statement, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">which you can read in full here</a>, Nintendo never specifically says prices will go up, but it is safe to assume that will be the case. If the prices were going down, the announcement would have been celebratory and probably appeared on the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/future-nintendo-and-switch-2-news-will-arrive-via-new-nintendo-today-app">Nintendo Today app</a>. It wouldn't have been a no-frills post buried on its news website.</p><p>However, the statement does specify that the Switch 2 console, physical and digital Switch and Switch 2 games, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships will all remain consistent "at this time." That's good news given that Nintendo had already <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories</a> before taking pre-orders in the US due to the economic environment stemming from US tariffs.&nbsp;</p><p>The price adjustment news comes on the heels of Nintendo sharing a separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">three-month earnings report statement</a>. In it, Nintendo reiterated that it had sold 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the four days following the launch, and has reached over <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">6 million units</a> in the seven weeks after release day. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 5.63 million units. Though mentioned in its report as one of Switch 2's launch games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour/homework-the-video-game">Welcome Tour's</a> sales numbers were not specified.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-changing-but-not-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection is the latest retrospective compilation by <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration/a-half-century-of-gaming-history-stuffed-into-an">Atari 50</a> and The Making of Karateka developer, Digital Eclipse. Bundling the earliest MK titles across arcade, console, and handheld, it’s shaping up to be a robust offering for diehard fans. During EVO 2025, the fan-favorite Mortal Kombat Trilogy was also confirmed for the title.</p><p>Mortal Kombat Trilogy was released in 1996 and is the final version of Mortal Kombat 3 (following Ultimate MK 3) that boasted every character and stage from previous games up to that point. Trilogy introduced Brutalities, a combo-focused alternative to Fatalities that has only resurfaced in the modern MK games, and the short-lived Aggressor Bar, which grants fighters increased speed and damage when filled. Trilogy was available on PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, PC, and even Tiger's R-Zone headset/handheld, but Digital Eclipse has not yet confirmed which version(s) of the game will be included in Legacy Kollection.&nbsp;</p><p>Trilogy joins the growing list of games in the Kollection, which includes multiple versions of Mortal Kombat 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as handheld entries, such as the Game Boy Advance titles. Several games now boast online multiplayer with rollback netcode. The Legacy Kollection also features a new interactive documentary (a Digital Eclipse trademark) detailing MK's history with over 25 interview subjects, including creators Ed Boon and John Tobias.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital Eclipse also announced that Legacy Kollection will be released in physical editions for consoles and PC. This will come in three forms: Standard, Deluxe, and Kollector’s Edition.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> ($59.99) consists of the base game. Those who pre-order also receive one of four exclusive ninja-themed slipcovers based on Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Smoke. The physical Standard Edition is available for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and Switch. It will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> ($79.99) packs in a steelbook case, magnet, poster, lenticular card, arcade flyers, mini-marquees, and arcade cabinet cards. This edition is only available for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Switch and will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the <strong>Kollector’s Edition </strong>($149.99) includes all the previous goodies plus a Goro controller holder statue, a commemorative arcade token, a hardcover art and lore book, and a Scorpion/Sub-Zero pin set. This edition is available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC. There is currently no shipping date for the Kollector's Edition.&nbsp;</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection still doesn’t have a release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans won't have to worry about a deluge of out-of-place cosmetics and crossover skins, according to head of Respawn and Battlefield Studios Vince Zampelli and general manager Byron Beede.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Zampelli discussed the importance of sticking to the core visual identity of Battlefield as far as cosmetics are concerned.</p>
<p>"I think for us, that's what we've been focused on," he said. "We want to be true to Battlefield, we want this fantasy to feel like you'd expect of Battlefield, so that's what we've been focused on."</p>

<p>Beede, who previously led the Call of Duty franchise before jumping over to work as general manager for Battlefield, when asked about the "Fortnitifaction" of modern FPS games, stated: "That's a hard one to answer right? You kinda have to do things to let people differentiate themselves and be unique, so it's how you do that in a way that doesn't go too far. We don't have to worry about that right now."</p>
<p>When Eurogamer followed up by saying there was a distinct difference between different variations of military cosmetics and American Dad characters (as an example), Beede replied "there probably is a difference, yeah". Beede refused to speak on the topic further.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">having just revealed its multiplayer mode and a global release date</a>, is clearly looking to blast a big hole in the current AAA FPS ecosystem. Whereas other series - like Call of Duty - have been swamped with a deluge of crossover skins and promotional items, there is clearly an appetite for a shooter less eager to throw immersion out the window. Battlefield 6 is positioned to land large on most core FPS platforms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">Not the Switch 2 though, that's safe for now</a>.</p>

			<p>Starfield will reportedly launch on PlayStation 5 sometime next year, along with the game's second expansion and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>According to what unspecified sources have <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told MP1st</a>, the Xbox Series X|S console exclusive from Bethesda will not launch this year on PlayStation 5 as previously rumored, but only in 2026, in part due to the low sales of the first expansion, Shattered Space. At this time, Microsoft is leaning toward releasing Starfield during Spring 2026, together with the second yet-to-be-revealed expansion and some quality of life improvements. The announcement timeline also doesn't seem to be clear, but it's unlikely the new version of the game will be revealed later this month during this year's Gamescom, nor will it be shadowdropped like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Oblivion Remastered</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>It's not really surprising to learn that Starfield: Shattered Space isn't selling well. While the expansion's tight narrative elements and its atmosphere that borders space horror are very well done, the expansion doesn't offer anything different from the base game. The asking price also doesn't help, as it is too high for what the expansion has to offer, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the base game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 01/08/2025:</strong> Though Nintendo stated it would wait until Sunday, August 3, 2025, to unveil the new prices for the Nintendo Switch and a few specific Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, it seems that the US retailer Target has let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-switch-in-the-us-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, according to <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=nintendo+switch&amp;ignoreBrandExactness=true&amp;Nao=0&amp;facetedValue=551qz">Target's website</a>, the new prices for Nintendo Switch consoles have all increased by at least $30. The new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $339.99 USD ($40 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $229 USD ($30 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $399 USD ($50 up from previous price)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Following a similar announcement at the end of June for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorKwcamh1Em9gwHD9rlcQ7-SZ-YwKnhp8OmOX208TEZnYW1R9bQ">Canada</a>, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">announced </a>that it will change the price of the Nintendo Switch and its "<em>family of systems and products</em>," including the base Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and accessories. Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, will stay the same for now, as will pricing for its peripherals and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced the news on its official website, with a short message that doesn't specifically say how the prices will be altered, but it's unfortunately doubtful that the prices will be decreased. Just as Nintendo did for its Canada announcement, Nintendo says these changes are being made "<em>based on market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>It's also clearly a price increase because while the US price changes will be announced in just a few days on August 3, 2025, Canadians had to wait from June 30, 2025, until today, to find out what the new prices would be. To no one's surprise, they're all price increases.</p>



<p>Before today, the price of a Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite in Canada was:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $399 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $259 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $449 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, everything has been bumped up by at least $20, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/hardware/">the new prices are</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $419 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $279 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $489 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>So expect the cost of getting a Nintendo Switch console in the US to be a little more expensive when these prices go live in a few days. As a reminder, here's what the Nintendo Switch family of systems costs in the US today, before the price increases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $299 USD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $199 USD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $349 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>Nintendo also clarified that while the Nintendo Switch 2 console and most of its peripherals would not be getting a price alteration, some Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like the Alarmo clock and certain Amiibo, will get price adjustments. </p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't getting a price change now, it's a little concerning that the previous generation is getting a price bump. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling extremely</a> well so far, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs</a> potentially behind these price increases, and the Switch 2 proving that players are hungry to jump from their eight-year-old Nintendo Switch console, it makes you wonder when Nintendo will pull the lever on increasing prices for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>In its statement on price changes coming after this weekend, after stipulating that Switch 2 prices are not impacted in the changes announced today, Nintendo says, "<em>However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</em></p>
