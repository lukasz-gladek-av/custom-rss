                <p>Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has spoken up to assure people that the Switch 2 should be in stock through the holiday. Appearing on CBS Mornings, Bowser said Nintendo has a "steady supply of manufacturing" for the Switch 2 that should continue to make its way to retailers.</p><p>"We believe we'll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer... and on into the holiday period," Bowser said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xHJ1SlyDys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3xHJ1SlyDys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Switch 2's initial preorders sold through, and the console is still not in regular supply for anyone who wants one. You can consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 buying guide</a> to help secure a console for yourself.</p><h2><strong>"Fluid and complex situation"</strong></h2><p>Also in the interview, Bowser addressed the ongoing tariff situation and how it impacts the Switch 2. The executive clarified that Switch 2 consoles for the US are primarily manufactured in the US, while Nintendo also makes Switch 2 consoles in China and Cambodia for other parts of the world.</p><p>Bowser acknowledged that it's a "fluid and complex situation" as it relates to tariffs. And while Nintendo did not raise prices on the Switch 2 console, it did raise prices on some accessories due to tariffs. Looking ahead, Bowser said Nintendo is "looking at various scenarios" to help ensure the Switch 2 can stay at $450 for the base model and $500 for the Mario Kart 2 bundle.</p><p>US President Donald Trump announced a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/xi-visit-vietnam-china-us-trade-d7046613bff2c9ef31162ae8dd436263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">46% tariff on products from Vietnam</a>, but it was paused and is now not expected to go into effect until July. Specifically, the pause is in effect until July 9. A 46% tariff rate is significant, but it's unclear how Nintendo would react if tariffs at that level are implemented.</p>

<figure><a title="nms mp issues" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/511d39d642ab6/nms-mp-issues.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, the big new Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of Hello Games' ever-evolving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> is now in the wild, and it's certainly looking like a much slicker, smoother experience on Nintendo's powered-up platform. Indeed, we're planning a full review in due course, so sit tight on that while we work our way through the launch games.</p>
<p>However! It appears all is not well with this new version of the game. We guess bugs are to be expected with titles of this size on platforms this new, though this is quite a biggie. Indeed, as of right now, the multiplayer aspect of the game, which includes playing online with pals, as well as being tied to other in-game discovery elements, seems to be completely broken.</p>
<figure><a title="nms mp issues" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac064ccdbaa0a/nms-mp-issues.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After seeing reports online, we jumped in and ran into the issue ourselves, with our game telling us that it has no connection to any matchmaking services, as shown in our pic above. As it turns out, it's been a whole thing since the game dropped a few days ago, with players taking to various forums and social media to voice their concerns having run into the exact same issue.</p>


<p>The woes continue, too, as it seems cross-saves are also causing issues, although this one is easier to explain, as it's due to various platforms running on different numbered versions of the game. So, we'll need to wait for the Switch 2 version to be brought in line, it seems, to fix that one.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Hello Games about the issues, and will update you as soon as we hear anything. We do reckon they'll be getting this snafu sorted fairly quick-smart, though, given it's quite a serious one.</p>

While he wasn't a core part of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bccf8de0-f24d-4021-9f80-f175dae84092" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dying-light-2-stay-human-review" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2</a>'s</em> story, only being mentioned by name, he's back again in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>a smaller adventure set after the events of <em>Dying Light 2 </em>that pick up with Crane looking to find and get revenge on the Baron for what he got put through.</p>

<h2>Catching Up With Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Since we last saw Kyle Crane, more has been understood about how he's simultaneously infected but also able to retain his humanity. He spent time offscreen trapped by The Baron, and now that he has been able to get out, he's wanting revenge. While we don't know much about what The Baron put Crane through, we know that he was experimenting on him for thirteen years.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down and get my hands on an hour of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. This gameplay demo gave me a chance to explore the open world, make a safe house, hide from volatiles in the dark, take on an armed militia, and lastly take on a massive Chimera creature.</p>

<p>Sitting down with Aaron Telty, QA Analyst at Techland, I loaded into the world. Immediately, I was hit with just how gorgeous <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>looks. Starting in a courtyard of derelict buildings with an afternoon sun shining warm orange light across the world… I was immediately beset by zombies.</p>

<p>After getting familiar with the controls, I headed out into the world. Much like previous <em>Dying Light </em>titles the world of <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>is a parkour playground. I was hopping from light post to dangling rope, through a building (doing a bit of looting along the way), and launching off zombies to attain higher ground.</p>

<p>Starting with just a crowbar, it wasn't too long (with the assistance of a guiding QA hand) that I stumbled upon an Axe lodged into a poor human in the back of a truck. Swapping between weapons was an easy process and there was clear indications as to just how powerful everything was in comparison.</p>

<p>An interesting gameplay mechanic I learned early, when I horribly misjudged a jump and ended up staring at a game over screen, was that in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>when you die you'll lost a portion of your gained experience for the level. While not a lot it's an interesting balance between stat progression, risking your time outside (especially at night), and wanting to progress in levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Improvements To <em>Dying Light 2 </em>That Have Carried Over<br>
An interesting aspect that kept coming up while playing <em>The Beast </em>was that since I last played <em>Dying Light 2 </em>at time of review and release there are a lot of systems including weapon, gore, and movement mechancs that have been improved over time that I didn't experience in 2, that I now could as part of The Beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I continued my path to a safe house the sun began to set on the world. With that Volatiles, incredibly dangerous zombies began appearing. With a quick scan of the environment Crane is able to directly spot them, glowing with red skeletons in the night.</p>

Crouching down and switching off my flashlight I quietly navigated through tall grass to reach the safe house. It was reinforced that the stage of the game I was playing it was definitely more important to remain stealthed but that later on in the game, after leveling up and unlocking additional abilities you'd be able to hold your own much better in the night sections.</p>

<h2>Playing Your Way</h2>

<p>A key theme of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was how it's up to the player to decide how they want to approach each new obstacle in the game. I got to see this a number of times. Initially, it was in securing the safe house. Descending into the basement to return power to the small apartment I snuck through a room of unconscious zombies. There were at least a dozen in this small room.</p>

<p>Creeping around I was able to obtain a fuse and power up the generator, waking the zombies in the process. Knowing I had limited durability on my weapons, and I wasn't likely going to get much out of killing the zombies in this room I simply left, jumping back into the vent I had entered the room in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=28Ba4wjl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=5-WTLU3I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This kind of difference in approach came up again shortly after, reaching a facility that was being guarded by a small militia. Ascending to the roof it was recommended that I approach this with stealth where I can… unfortunately I was already charging forward and had prepared to dropkick the nearest guard clean off the roof.</p>

<p>With a variety of quiet and loud combat options, stealth sections, and even open world driving I was impressed with just how quickly you might have one plan, that immediately becomes something else.</p>

<h2>Unleash The Beast</h2>

<p>A unique gameplay aspect of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is in Kyle Crane's infected genetics. As you deal and take melee damage you'll be slowly increasing a rage meter in the lower left of your screen.</p>

<p>Once that meter has reached it's peak you can click in with both thumbsticks to tap into a more menacing kind of combat. Putting away his weapons Crane bares his fists to grab, smack, punch, and even tear off zombies limbs as he goes fully feral.</p>

<p>While in this mode I also seemed to notice that Crane ran faster, possible a good ability to have in your back pocket in case a situation is about to go sideways.</p>

<h2>Investigate The World As Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Another neat aspect of the demo experience (after I dropkicked way too many guards off roofs) was entering a facility where I needed to do some sleuthing. Standing next to a cage that something had broken out of, interesting machinery, and suspicious piping Crane was able to analyse each to get an idea of what creature had been contained, a Chimera, and what he could do to lure it back and kill it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=EzUV1AxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=5Bi85aCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Entering another zombie infested area and obtaining a flamethrower I then got gas to attract the Chimera and engaged in a massive battle. This creature, at least 12 feet tall even with a hunched over stance, was a beast that while humanoid in shape had clearly been stretched to the limits of it's form.</p>

<p>The Chimera, with exposed muscle tendons glistening in the light crashed through a car yard. This boss battle was hard, and not just in the way that I was rusty with the controls, but that where Crane was in the story just two attacks connecting from this creature would put me in the dust.</p>

<p>Through (alot) of trial and error I was able to coordinate dodging shockwave attacks, rocks getting hurled at me, and sliding out of the way of a charging attack defeating him. For Crane upgrades to movement and attacks are through natural experience and progressions, but it's only in defeating the Chimera and possibly other advanced infected that Crane is able to level up his infected abilities.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Dying Light </em>and <em>Dying Light 2</em> the experience for The Beast is more linear. This is in essence part of how the game came about, initially as DLC for Dying Light 2 before getting spun off. It's total runtime will also be shorter, but will still likely be around the 20 hours space.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Dying Light </em>there's really no reason to not be looking forward to <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's not only an evolution on the basic formula but with a more linear approach to the narrative there is a lot more chance to really get invested in the world and it's characters.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I walked out of my Summer Game Fest 2025 demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mixtape/" data-ref-id="5000-631968">Mixtape</a> beaming like an idiot, a smile stuck on my face. I can't think of a game that has ever vibed as hard as Mixtape does. Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's debut, The Artful Escape, was a vibes game, too. Light on traditional gameplay mechanics and basically lacking any fail states, it instead leaned into aesthetics, mood, and tone. It was more of a feeling than a traditional game, but I loved it for that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are lots of vibes games, like Unpacking, Night in the Woods, and Firewatch, to name a few. I love a good vibes game, and Mixtape, the next game from the team behind The Artful Escape, feels like it could be the ultimate example. I played about 30 minutes of Mixtape and saw what you might call a few levels of the game, which plays like a '90s-set coming-of-age story but is meant to feel "sorta like channel-surfing [old-school] MTV at 3 AM," developer Johnny Galvatron told me.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Mixtape, you play a group of three high-school pals on the cusp of graduating and looking to make it to a party on the beach to cap off their childhood. The party is going to rule if they can just get there, and each figurative step toward that end goal is played out to a different song that collectively makes up one of the best licensed soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Joy Division, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins, and many more bring so much life to this game. Something about the joining of gaming and music has always been incredibly powerful to me, and Mixtape's way of bringing these things together sincerely blew my mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that the gameplay side of Mixtape is especially intricate. But it's always changing. The main mechanic seems like it'll be what you may have seen in the trailer: coasting downhill in a skateboard, dodging cars, flipping off cops, and stopping to sneak a couple of beers out of your house. But the game toys with not just this format--like a later level in which I led the police on a high-speed chase in a careening shopping cart--but also cleverly gamifies the group's friendship and experiences in other ways. I laughed out loud when I was hit with a French-kissing minigame, where each joystick controlled one tongue, and I was free to mash and swirl the tongues together in what is sure to become a viral moment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later scene, the teens were driving to a fast food restaurant and blasting music along the way, turning the moment into an interactive headbanging mechanic in which you'd move to the music and rock out with your buddies. There's no penalty for doing it poorly, and seemingly no demand you do it at all. Mixtape is largely on rails in a sense, in that it's paced to play out nearly the same no matter how much you toy with the world in these fleeting but emotionally impactful ways. For instance, you do need to French kiss for a bit, but even then, you can keep it going much longer if you want to, long after the prompt tells you "that's enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Mixtape is a hard game to describe. If you're not one to find music especially moving or important, you surely won't find the gameplay moments carry you through to having the same euphoric experience I and many others had at SGF--I've been hearing a lot of people call it their game of the show. However, if you're like me, and you have some mushy nostalgia for the '90s, a romantic view of bands like The Cure, and a willingness to let an experience be something quite unlike a traditional video game, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I have: Mixtape is transcendent.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Obviously, it's personal preference, but Nintendo GameCube has one of the most smile-inducing system startup sequences with its purple cubes rolling around to a catchy tune. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> owners can experience this delightful moment every time they open the GameCube app with one simple trick: holding the left stick in any direction.</p><p dir="ltr">The GameCube library is new to the Nintendo Classics collection with the introduction of Switch 2, though accessing it does require subscribing to the premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier ($50 annually for an individual, $80 for a family). As such, the regular bootup for the app just showcases the purple GameCube controller overlaid on a red background, similar to the Nintendo 64 or NES apps.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania.1213641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We must admit, when Atari announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> over the weekend, it took us a good couple of minutes to realise it was officially linked to the classic 2600 game <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the trailer, the overall look and feel of the game didn't really form any connections in our mind, but then the title came up and we thought <em>"heh, Adventure of Samsara from Atari, that's kinda like the original Adventure"</em>. Slumped in chairs after caning the Switch 2 for a few days, the penny finally dropped.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Adventure of Samsara is, according to Atari, a completely new game set in the world of Adventure. In other words, then, it's neither a sequel not a remake. It is, however, a metroidvania, kinda like what the company did with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yars_rising">Yars Rising</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by indie studio Ilex Games, Adventure of Samsara will see you traverse 10 unique biomes with gameplay reminiscent of classic Prince of Persia titles. And, of course, for those who recovered the Enchanted Chalice and perhaps discovered Warren Robinett's hidden room in the original 1980 game, there will be plenty of curious easter eggs to discover.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</p>
<p>- <strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.</p>
<p>- <strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</p>
<p>- <strong>Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</p>
<p>- <strong>Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no date for Adventure of Samsara yet beyond the current 2025 window, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's PC Gaming Show 2025, Aspyr Media unveiled Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition, the definitive version of 2002's classic roleplaying game made by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>
<p>Aspyr Media promised smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI. Indeed, the game is coming to consoles for the first time (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), although it's also available on PC (Steam and GOG), of course. Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition will debut on all these platforms on July 15 for $29.99, but a 10% discount is available until launch.</p>
<p>The game supports crossplay between all platforms when in co-op multiplayer mode (up to four players). Moreover, this version includes the base game and the three expansions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mask of the Betrayer:</strong> Cursed with an insatiable hunger only quelled by devouring spirits, the Shard-Bearer must travel to the Shadow Realm to unearth the cause of this dark affliction.</li>
<li><strong>Storm of Zehir:</strong> You and your crew are shipwrecked on the shores of a hostile jungle nation. Fighting your way back to civilization, you uncover a plot threatening to change Faerûn forever.</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries of Westgate:</strong> Beware the city of Westgate, where anything goes and everything has a price. Explore and expose the secrets hidden deep in the city’s underbelly before they consume you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition also fully supports Steam Workshop, providing access to a wealth of adventures and modules. Moreover, this version still allows the player to become a Dungeon Master and craft their own adventures to share with other players. The original game was renowned for its deep but complex modding tools.</p>
<p>If you want to go all-in on the series, there's also a&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/53494/Neverwinter_Nights_1__2_Enhanced_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neverwinter Nights 1 + 2 Enhanced Collection</a> that includes the previously released <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition</a>.</p>

After the initial title's success, the ChromaGun is back once again to test players with their memory of basic color matching.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>ChromaGun </em>at Summer Game Fest. The demo opened with the standard fair for anyone familiar with these kinds of portal-like titles. In a testing facility you’ll be enticed to pick up the <em>ChromaGun</em>, getting just a single color at first your aim.</p>

The main way you progress is by successfully moving floating spheres around rooms. The way that you move them is by creating wall and ceiling panels of the same color.</p>

<p>A yellow sphere will be attracted to a yellow wall tile. This works when the switch you need the sphere to be on is located right under a tile. If the switch is between wall tiles then you may need to daisy chain it between two, in that case the sphere will move to an equidistant location between the two tiles.</p>

<h2>How Do You Make Purple Again?</h2>

<p>Adding further complication, different wall tiles and spheres will not just come in the primary colors – yellow, blue, and red – but also in Secondary colors. Forcing you to have to remember something basic like if you want your Blue Sphere to head towards the Purple wall tile then you’ll have to shoot your Sphere with the color Red.</p>

While there was no strict tutorial,&nbsp;<em>ChromaGun 2</em> did a good job to slowly layer mechanics.</p>

<p>A core theme within <em>ChromaGun 2</em>, something I learned as I leapt from a ledge straight into a portal was that ChromaGun’s ‘worlds’ are all based on alternate realities where you might trade out the sterile white walls and right angles, for curved structures, a visual filter that makes it look like you’re playing the game as a classic comic book, and the last ‘world’ I entered before I finished my time was a barnyard settings.</p>

<h2>Weird Worlds</h2>

<p>Each zone has a unique style that makes it easy to check where you are at any point, but didn’t vary too much in terms of gameplay. Regardless, it was an interesting reskin of what you’d expect to see in a game about completing tests.</p>

<p>Each zone additionally has a different robotic/AI voice as your tested who is confused upon your arrival, but interacts with you with a different personality.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the original ChromaGun title, or you’re into the idea of a puzzle game that leans heavily into color shifting and matching then this will likely be a title that you’ll want to keep an eye on. There’s a lot of times where you see a game attempt to totally reinvent itself between iterations, but if you’re good at what you do is that totally necessary?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been a massive fan of Supermassive games since <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b369c29-3d2f-4f8f-ae11-ac3c77f5e39e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> and with every new title iterating on gameplay, scares, and ways to experience the horror with my friends, I was very excited to sit down and get my hands on a small portion of <em>Directive 8020</em> and talk with Executive Producer Dan McDonald.</p>

<p>My gameplay demo began with a tense but hopeful conversation between a new astronaut Young talking with her mission direction Stafford. During the conversation there are hints about the declining state of the world, how Young's father died four years prior, and that they would be ready to head to the stars once again to visit a planet that could inhabit life.</p>

<p>McDonald explained to me that this mission is one to visit and gather information about this new planet and how it might be habitable. The plan is to just fly by, but one thing leads to another and the crew needed to land.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=0XygnpiC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=CdMIy7TV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After watching the cutscene, a discussion that McDonald said would continue to be flashed back to over the course of the story, the gameplay demo leapt ahead to Chapter 6 of the 8 Chapter story.</p>

<h2>Friends Or Enemies You Can't Trust</h2>

<p>Two Astronauts, Sermon and Stafford, were in the hydroponics lab aboard the spaceship. Canisters were broken and a strange organism was growing over them. From the darkness a humanoid figure steps forward, a perfect clone of one of the Astronauts until his face ripples unsettlingly.</p>

<p>Attacked by not just one, but two clones (one of which shapeshifts into a horrific alien creature), I was in control. Playing as Sermon, I was skulking around the service tunnels underneeth the main hydroponics area. The giant hunter seeking me out, I was able to try to crouch walking by it to make my escape.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=Yee7Fz8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=VF41BBmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Failing that I was thrown into a QTE, quickly mashing the X button I was able to turn my stun baton on the creature and get away while it writhed in pain. The Stun Baton was a multi-use weapon with a brief recharge (luckily, it charged again in time before I needed it once more).</p>

<p>In these tunnels, there were also other options to distract or make my way past the creature. Running was an option, but McDonald also showed me that there were a variety of interactable objects that could take the Hunter's attention as well as a radar system that allows the player to briefly see the creature through walls.</p>

<p>Shortly after escaping, the two astronauts returned to the rest of the crew with a new fear that one of the party members was not what they seemed.</p>

<p>While the horror of other Dark Pictures games from Supermassive have been about a very recognizable foe, the thought of an enemy that could be one of the players (even one being played by a character) is a fantastic approach to horror. As well as being inspired by <em>The Thing</em> McDonald highlighted other sources such as <em>Event Horizon, Alien</em>, and specifically called out the purples and greens to add that eerie <em>Color Out Of Space</em> vibe to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=hxF3x39z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=xTUXMC1m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I didn't see too much, what I did see spoke wonders about the game. After getting to play through the game and understand more of the tense nature of the plot I got to talk with McDonald more about gameplay elements, multiplayer, and how the shift away from only walking and reactions to active stealth and combat will remain accessible to all skill levels.</p>

<h2>An Overall Upgrade</h2>

<p>In terms of gameplay all of the movement has been overhauled to align with a more traditional 3rd person horror title. McDonald highlighted the experiences working on <em>Devil In Me</em>, specifically the clamber mechanic, with how they could continue to reshape their movement.</p>

<p>It's not just movement related to stealth that's been improved either as changes have also been made to allow for more puzzle systems to be used in the game.</p>

<p>Highlighting a few of the choices that were made over the course of gameplay McDonald pulled up a detailed path showing where events you encounter are intended, and where they can split. He explained that with every choice you make you can then easily revert back to the choice right before.</p>

<p>They wanted to make sure that anyone playing the game could play it in a linear fashion, or they could go back through and retry choices over and over again to get the whole scope of the game without needing to replay it from scratch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=HNamyInN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=2bwgkU8c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another important change was that instead of building the game for a three act structure, like a movie, instead each chapter followed the structure of a TV show episode. Understanding that as their games were becoming larger and more involved, it would be harder for players to complete them in a single sitting. By swapping to an episodic structure there are more places for players to conclude a single session, but be excited to pick up when the story continues.</p>

<h2>Accessible To Everyone, No Matter Your Skill Level</h2>

<p>The last important piece of information that I got about <em>Directive 8020</em> was that Movie Night mode is not only returning but has been improved. Movie Night, a mode where each character in the story can be assigned to a different player in your party, now functions not only with local play but over the internet, creating a fun group experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the game was becoming more mechanically complex in Movie Night mode you can adjust the difficulty and accessibility per player. This means someone who is familiar with video games and the Dark Pictures games can have normal QTE timing and stealth modes, while the senses of the Hunter can be turned down for a player less familiar with the controls.</p>

<p>As a game series that I love to play with friends of all different skill levels I was so happy to hear that a custom experience could be created to allow for everyone to have just as fun a time.</p>

<p><em>Directive 8020</em> is certainly one of the most anticipated releases for me coming out to Summer Game Fest and with the developments to the gameplay, and the understanding of the audience and wanting to include as many players as possible the team at Supermassive have really demonstrated an understanding for fans of their games.</p>

We see less than two minutes of the upcoming vehicular carnage, but we learn a bit more about what to expect from the new season and how closely it may connect to the video game franchise.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even in the short clip, we get some (literal) blasts from <em>Twisted Metal</em> past. Roach Coach’s exterminator van from <em>Twisted Metal 4</em> is seen firing bullets from under a giant roach atop its roof. After last season’s finale showed a tournament photo of Mr. Grimm, one of the longest-running characters in <em>Twisted Metal</em> history, we finally get to see the soul-stealing biker in action, weaving around missiles being launched at him by a sadistically euphoric Sweet Tooth (brought to life with the physicality of Joe Seanoa, aka Samoa Joe, and the voice of Will Arnett). But, for me, none of those appearances elicit more nostalgia than seeing just quick glimpses of the half-man, half-murder vehicle, Axel, appearing in War Wheel form. There are no close-ups of the fan-favorite killing machine, but we do see him navigating those gigantic wheels around in ways we haven’t seen since <em>Twisted Metal</em>’s heyday.</p><p>According to the video’s description, John (Anthony Mackie) will reunite with his long-lost sister, Dollface (Tiana Okoye), who, in the first season, we learn is the leader of a group of female vigilantes known as “The Dolls.” Unfortunately, the reunion isn’t featured in this short clip of the new season, so we’ll have to wait for that show-shifting meeting when the second season of <em>Twisted Metal</em> premieres July 31.</p><p>Until then, rewatch the clip and rejoice in the fact that this is probably not even a fraction of the action we’ll likely be blessed with in less than a month.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a matter of fact, <strong>you can use any USB-C camera on the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which means that you may already have a perfectly viable webcam lying around your house! But if you’ve been looking around the net, you’ve probably noticed two very popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras have been getting a lot of attention: The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the HORI Piranha Plant camera.</p><h2 id="h227210"><a id=""></a>Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</h2><p>It’s not all that surprising that one of the best camera options for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes directly from Nintendo itself. The aptly-titled Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a feature-filled choice at a fairly reasonable price of $55, and it’s probably the overall smartest choice of camera for the console for most folks.</p><p>The Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera offers a sleek form factor, a wide viewing range that can accommodate multiple people in one room, and an all-black aesthetic that helps it blend into an entertainment space. There’s even a privacy shutter for safety when the camera is not in use. </p><p>Toss in a moderately crisp 1080p resolution, and you’ve got yourself a somewhat modern-feeling camera to use during GameChat sessions. While a modern high-end webcam is undeniably going to offer better video quality, this little guy is likely cheaper while still being more than enough for casual chats and Mario Party fun!</p><h2 id="h227211"><a id=""></a>HORI Piranha Plant Camera</h2><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera is actually licensed by Nintendo, which explains why it’s rocking such a cool piranha plant aesthetic. Unlike the more low-key, professional vibe of the official camera, this awesome-looking piece of tech plays into the universal love of Nintendo.</p><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera kind of manages to make itself fun to use. For instance, it’s genuinely cool that you can bend the piranha plant’s neck to get the right angle you need, blending functionality and cuteness into a single feature. Oh, and its privacy shutter is achieved by literally closing the mouth. Quirky!</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, while the intriguing visual design and versatility of this device are excellent, its 480p resolution is shockingly poor for a camera in 2025</strong>. As such, <strong>it’s honestly best suited for kids or non-enthusiasts who don’t care as much about picture quality</strong>. It’s kind of a bummer, too, because it sure is a cool little device.</p><h2 id="h227212"><a id=""></a>Which should you buy?</h2><p>As you can see, each of these two popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras offers its own pros and cons. The one you should buy depends on what you need for GameChat. If you’re an older enthusiast who plans to spend a lot of time in GameChat sessions with friends and wants a camera with solid video quality and a slim, sleek form factor, the Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is your best bet. If you’re a younger gamer, or video quality is secondary to you, the fun and silly nature of the HORI Piranha Plant Camera is undeniably appealing. </p><p>Whichever one you pick, remember to use the privacy shutter when you pick your nose. Or don’t. I don’t really care what you do. How you deal with your rhinotillexomania is your business.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-lets-you-channel-your-inner-john-hammond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I never stopped thinking about wanting to repeat all of John Hammond's mistakes since the first time I saw him make them in 1993's Jurassic Park. And I've had many opportunities to do so in various park-builder games in the decades since, ranging all the way from pretty disappointing to pretty great. The latest, Jurassic World Evolution 3, is looking to deliver more features than we've ever seen in a dinosaur park management game before. And at least for my part, you had me at [insert signature T-Rex roar in your mind's eye here].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that's always bugged me about the previous Jurassic World Evolution games is that they seemed a bit stripped-down compared to what Frontier has shown us is possible with their sister franchises, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. So the thing I'm most excited about with Evolution 3 is that it seems like we're finally getting the full Frontier feature set in a Jurassic game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can build your own hotels, gift shops, and staff buildings by snapping together tons of resizable and re-colorable props. You can reshape the terrain at will, make your own functional waterfalls, and even create dinosaur enclosures that use natural rock formations instead of electric fences as part of the perimeter. The devs want everything you build to feel like it still belongs in the Jurassic franchise, so the props and such are a bit more grounded-looking than what you might see in Planet Coaster 2. But for the first time, it doesn't feel like they're compromising at all on the sandbox elements that make their other games great for the sake of being a licensed game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>LIFE FINDS A WAY</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major addition here is the inclusion of dinosaur breeding and baby dinosaurs for the first time. While the previous games in the series relied on artificial fertilization and incubation of eggs, Evolution 3 will actually allow you to clone fertile dinosaurs, place dinosaur nests, and even selectively crossbreed for specific skins, stats, and personality traits. And this, of course, comes with the addition of juvenile models for all of the more than 80 species included in the base game. On top of this, adult males and females will now exhibit varying levels of sexual dimorphism, like male triceratops having larger frills, meaning there will be more than 240 distinct dino and prehistoric reptile models in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will introduce new challenges to manage within your enclosures, too. For instance, Frontier told us a male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other. This will vary somewhat from species to species, as they have different social dynamics with each other and with other species. It even matters for breeding, since some species will only nest if they're out of view of pesky humans and don't have any other species around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3 will also be taking us to a variety of different worldwide locations that are new to the series, including the mountains of Japan and the Mediterranean island of Malta. They not only feature their own distinct plant life and terrain, but also building sets and props that can add a little bit of global flair to your park. The ones we saw included an East Asian-themed set, an Alpine European-themed set, a set based on the original Jurassic Park films with a kitschy jungle aesthetic, and one based on the newer Jurassic World films that looks more modern and shiny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we won't be fighting with the climate in different biomes the same way as in Planet Zoo, each one will feature different clients in the campaign mode that want you to focus on different objectives. Some might be interested in simply selling as many tickets and luxury hotel rooms as possible, while others lean more into conservation and science.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>CHANGING WORLD</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while we'll be working with the Dinosaur Integration Network, or DIN. To be honest, the newer films are mostly just a big mushy blob in my head, but I think the idea is that dinosaurs just live in the wild now and we're trying to learn how to coexist with them instead of putting them back in cages. It's whatever. The originals are still the ones that matter to me, and it sounds like we'll be fully able to build a dinosaur theme park in the spirit of the original films.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there also seems to be something sinister going on with a secretive group who doesn't like DIN and might cause trouble at your park, based on an ominous moment in the trailer. And that could be interesting, too. In previous games, tropical storms and equipment malfunctions could lead to dinosaurs breaking out and running rampant. But the first book and film were about a human saboteur causing a massive disaster, so that feels in the spirit of the franchise for me as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are worried about your dinos going for a stroll and choosing to have the kind of snack that's going to require you to pay out millions to their family, there are some new tools for that as well. You won't be warned automatically, for instance, if a fence is in poor shape or being attacked by a hangry carnotaurus. For that, you'll need security cameras with full coverage along the length of the fence, allowing you to be notified as soon as there's a problem. And if the cameras go down, well, I hope you have good lawyers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>OPEN FOR BUSINESS</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, you don't have to work particularly hard to get me excited about a new dinosaur park management game. Especially one with the in-depth customization tools Frontier has become known for. Watching a baby triceratops play in the grass is adorable. I don't care who you are. And the breeding mechanics open up a lot of long-term possibilities for making not just the parks I want, but the kinds of dinosaurs I want, too. As a paleontology nerd who's a bit bummed the designs in the Jurassic franchise are a bit stuck in the 90s, I asked if I could breed my raptors to have feathers, but the devs were a bit tight-lipped about that. I guess we can hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be coming to Playstation 5, Xbox, and PC on October 21.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-director-ninja-turtle-ign-live-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-director-ninja-turtle-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake, more classic games in the beloved franchise are set to get revamped with the impending release of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4. At IGN Live, the game’s director, Kurt Tillmanns, was on hand to talk about what this collection has to offer in terms of mixing new and old elements - including one bright green new inclusion in the form of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's resident party dude, Michaelangelo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said Tillmans, about including such an offbeat and notable new skater on the roster, “It was awesome working with Nickelodeon on getting Mikey in here. We were super passionate. Everyone who gets an opportunity to be part of a Tony Hawk game is just incredibly gracious and excited to be a part of it. They're wonderful collaborators. You know, we took great pride in building him for the game. He's also got three turtle-themed special tricks in the game that you can get when you unlock him, and you can equip those onto any other skater in the game. So, that's a ton of fun by itself!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it came to adding a two-minute timer element to this version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Tillmans remarked, “We’re rebuilding two of the best games of all time from the ground up. And we wanted this to be one game. It's got the concept from two awesome games, but it really is one game. So that means that Tony Hawk 3 is going to get some features and things that Tony Hawk 4 had and Tony Hawk 4, along with the classic goals that you remember, is going to be able to be played with a two-minute timer. That timer can actually be extended up to an hour for people who want to play more at their own pace. We've also got all of the classic game modes returning, so you can skate around in the four parks and free skate single session or speed run and continue to do things at your own pace in those modes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tillmans said he was excited by the online play aspect of the game because he felt, for Iron Galaxy, “That is the heritage of our studio. So, we are extremely excited to be bringing this game to seven platforms. We’ve got both PlayStations, both Xboxes, both Switches, and three PC stores. And not only that, we are going to feature cross-play across every single platform. So that's huge. This game is coming to the widest audience, to the widest player base that any Tony Hawk game has ever had."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked about developing the Switch 2 version of the game, Tillmans laughed, “I mean, honestly, what's one other platform when we’re already doing six, right? As soon as we knew that we were going to be in the window and it was going to be possible for us to be able to support it, we just jumped at the opportunity.” As for the performance of the game on the new console, he noted, “We're going to run at 60 FPS on Switch 2 on every park, so it's going to be amazing performance.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The soundtracks have always been a big part of the Tony Hawk games, and Tillmans said that for the remake of Pro Skater 3 + 4, “We have a ton of people who are just super passionate about the soundtrack. Obviously, when you start making a Tony Hawk game, that's one of the things that people are most excited about. We take it very seriously. Tony Hawk himself has a lot of opinions about the soundtrack and he probably knows more about the music that skaters are listening to than anyone else in the world, so we obviously hold his opinion in high esteem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what it was like working with Hawk himself, Tillmans said, “He’s an awesome collaborator. He's great to work with. He takes this being kind of the lexicon for skating very seriously. He plays the game frequently and he will often tell us, ‘Hey, think this trick name is now called something else. Let me check with some people.’ And he will make sure that the trick list, which has been updated from 1 + 2, represents the language and the verbiage that skaters are using today."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the new skate parks the game includes, Tillmans said, “It’s a huge honor for us to be able to add, for the first time in over 10 years, three brand new parks into a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game. The game is going to feature the water park, the movie studio, and the pinball park. And the pinball park is super exciting. It fits in with that kind of park, like Roswell or Area 51 and Skater Heaven, where only Tony Hawk games could really take the skater into these fantastical places..” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tillmans explained, “When we come up with ideas for these parks, we think about the types of things that might be a forbidden place for a skater to go and skate, like a shut down water park that really fulfills that skater fantasy. And also those fantastic places, like a pinball park where the skater is actually like the size of a pinball in the machine skating around. The ball will ping pong around everywhere and wipe you out. And if you look up, there's actually a giant Tony Hawk playing the pinball machine that you're in. Then he'll react when you bail and cover his eyes. It's great."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, now that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1-4 have gotten the remake treatment, should we expect the fifth game, Tony Hawk’s Underground, next? When asked that question, Tillmans remained mostly tightlipped, but he let it be known the interest is certainly there, replying “We’re focused on shipping [3 + 4]. I'm getting text messages right now from people working on the game. So we want to ship this game. We can't wait to get 3 + 4 out to the audience. Beyond that, we would absolutely love to keep working on this.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Before and After Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on July 11, 2025, and you can check <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-first-impressions-of-the-remake">our first impressions of the remake right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Remakes and remasters are very much an 'in' thing at the moment, and while it's no surprise that we would eventually see what are arguably two of the best entries in the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series make their way to modern platforms, I definitely didn't expect this package to be as robust of a remake as it's shaping up to be," Our previewer, Nick Maillet said.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next Call of Duty installment was announced over the weekend, along with its release platforms: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 is slated to debut across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's omission of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release (at least presently) from the launch platform line-up has raised some eyebrows due to the fact that, back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">Microsoft announced a deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its platforms</a> on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity".</p>
<p>However, while for now there is no word of a Switch 2 release for Black Ops 7, the team is "committed" to bringing the Call of Duty series to Nintendo, Activision has told Eurogamer.</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Activision confirmed: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>On its release, Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. It stars Heroes and Gilmore Girls' Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason.</p>
<p>We can expect further details on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this summer, the team has said, so stay tuned for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="usb-c" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01cca1554615b/usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, I'm not entirely sure how much you take and use screenshots on your Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles, but let me tell you, I take tons and I use even more. So connecting to a Switch to my laptop via USB has become my go-to way to get my game shots up and ready for scrutiny where I need them.</p>
<p>So, you'll understand, I'm sure, my sadness in finding that you can only transfer data such as screenshots betwixt Switch 2 and PC using the bottom of two USB-C connections whilst using this option. What this leads to, dear friends, is a tragic situation, as you can see in my (terrible) photos, where the Switch 2 needs to be set lying down at an angle as it can no longer sit upright properly. The horror.</p>
<p>Indeed, using the top slot sees you greeted with an easy-to-miss message that, no, you'll need to use the bottom slot.</p>

<p>We're sure there's a perfectly valid reason. It's a shame, though, as if the top USB-C allowed it, I could look approximately 76% tidier (and thusly cooler) being able to do all this with my Switch 2 on its stand all nice and proper. But oh no. Well, not yet, anyway. Maybe Mario or one of those Nintendo big shots will see this and get it sorted.</p>
<p>Of course, there <em>are</em> easier ways to get your pics off your Switch, especially by just uploading screens to your phone, which works fine in most cases, so it's not a big issue. Simply open up your album, choose a shot and upload to your phone. But if I did it this way, well, I wouldn't have anything to complain about, would I?</p>
<p>You can also, if you are hip and trendy, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch-2/How-to-Upload-Screenshots-and-Videos-from-Nintendo-Switch-2-to-the-Nintendo-Switch-App-2843767.html#:~:text=You%20can%20set%20up%20your,enable%20or%20disable%20this%20feature.">use the Nintendo Switch app to automatically upload all of your screenshots</a>, without the need to stress at all. Again, where would I be for articles if I used these more modern techniques, I ask you?</p>
<p>In this case, all you need to do (besides having the app installed) is to go to your Album, select the cog on the bottom left of the screen, then select your user icon to head into Upload settings and turn on auto uploads. Hey, it turns out I <em>was</em> doing it a really dumb way, after all.</p>

<p>It's an ancient art form, though, this unnecessary grumbling about new things, you understand. Surely you've noticed something about the console that's irked you? Magnets too strong? Screen too big? Games too good? Come on, there must be something!</p>

Meanwhile, the rest of WBD’s corpse—mostly made up of TV and cable assets—will be split off into Global Networks and run by WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. </p><p>The separation is expected to be finished sometime in 2026. Oh, and most of the WBD’s debt, which is nearing $40 billion, will be dumped on the Widenfels TV company, perhaps revealing the actual reason this is happening.</p><p>“By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-debt-billions-to-tv-networks-company-1236259848/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-debt-billions-to-tv-networks-company-1236259848/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zaslav said in a statement</a></span> that sounds like he was trying to win a bet to include as many empty buzzwords as possible. </p><p>Personally, I think one company is more optimized than two companies, but I’m not a genius business guru like Zaslav, a man who gets so uncomfortable watching sex scenes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/david-zaslav-is-angling-to-become-americas-king-of-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/david-zaslav-is-angling-to-become-americas-king-of-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he makes people in the room stare forward and not look at one another until they’re over</a></span>.</p><p>Global Networks and Streaming &amp; Studios are the current names of the newly formed companies.
