<figure data-uuid="c1f0558e8cf02"><a title="Braid: Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1f0558e8cf02/braid-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Thekla</em></figcaption></figure><p>If, on a random Wednesday afternoon, you were considering picking up or replaying Braid on your Switch,then we've got good news for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/braid_anniversary_edition">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> has received a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and it's out today.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/braid-anniversary-edition-just-got-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Everything</a>, at the time of writing, the game is available on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000117066">the Japanese eShop</a>, with other territories surely following suit very soon. It costs 3,169 yen for the game, or 475 yen to upgrade, so expect to pay a little extra for the Switch 2 magic when it hits the eShop in your region.</p>
<p>So, what does the Switch 2 Edition bring to Braid? 120fps gameplay (if your TV supports it), even more developer commentary, and 1080p handheld and 4K docked resolution. Very nice.</p>
<p>If you've never played Braid before, the critically-acclaimed puzzler came to Switch back in 2024 as an enhanced rerelease of the 2008 indie classic. The Anniversary Edition features lovely painted pixel art, additional challenges, and developer commentary.</p>
<p>The game's creator, Jonathan Blow, spoke about the rerelease's sales just a few months after it launched, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/braid-anniversary-edition-sales-have-been-utterly-terrible-says-creator">calling them "utterly terrible"</a>. Perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will give the numbers a boost.</p>
<p>His next game, <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>, is coming to PC sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We have another film adaptation of a video game to look forward to, and it's once again another <strong>PlayStation</strong> franchise to add to the list of adaptations under the belt of <strong>Sony </strong>and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>. This time, it's <strong>Fast &amp; Furious</strong> director <strong>Justin Lin</strong> taking on an adaptation of <strong>Arrowhead Games' Helldivers</strong>, with Dune's Duncan Idaho, <strong>Jason Momoa,</strong> starring in the film.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, which adds that the film will premiere next year, on <strong>November 10, 2027,</strong> with Lin's <strong>Perfect Storm Entertainment</strong> and PlayStation Productions producing the film.</p>



<p>Other adaptations, whether they're set to be a TV series or a film, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO's The Last of Us</a></strong> or the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-movie-is-already-a-new-hit-franchise-says-sony/">Uncharted</a> </strong>movie, are easy to imagine with regard to their plot. We didn't have to wonder what kind of story <strong>Craig Mazin</strong> would try to tell with his Last of Us show. The same goes for Uncharted, because we knew it would be another treasure-hunting romp featuring Nathan Drake.</p>



<p>The same can't be said for this upcoming Helldivers movie; Lin could take the Starship Troopers-esque world Arrowhead has built and take it in several directions. What we can at least expect is that the film will stay true to the mixture of violence and comedy that Helldivers is known for, and, considering Lin's directing background, plenty of over-the-top action.</p>



<p>Lin hasn't directed every film in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but he has several under his belt. After directing <strong>Tokyo Drift</strong> in 2006, he directed Fast &amp; Furious in 2009,<strong> Fast Five</strong> in 2011, and <strong>Fast &amp; Furious 6</strong> in 2013. After that, he returned to the series to direct <strong>F9</strong> in 2021. With how grand the scale of action is when playing <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, Lin seems like the perfect choice to lead a film adaptation.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa, on the other hand, is a bigger question mark. It'll be interesting to see how he slots into this film, though his work in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">The Minecraft Movie</a></strong> suggests that he's more than up for a silly, video game-inspired adventure, and that he can be part of a movie hitting some serious numbers at the box office.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The usual array of questions is being thrown at Mewgenics, as a Steam title. This includes wondering about its Steam Deck compatibility and if the game supports PlayStation and/or Xbox controller support.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics</a> needs to be enjoyed in any way possible. The cuddly yet catastrophically grim and violent cat-oriented strategy title has wowed everyone since its February 10 release, and if you’re looking to play it on Steam, controller support could be a sticking point.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-mewgenics-using-a-playstation-or-xbox-controller">Can You Play Mewgenics Using a PlayStation or Xbox Controller?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A fun time to be had. Credit to Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mewgenics has complete PlayStation and Xbox controller support, and this has been verified and confirmed by its official Steam store listing.</strong></p>



<p>Good news: If you want to play Mewgenics with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S controller (or something adjacent), you can.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-playstation-xbox-switch-console-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Mewgenics on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch? Console Release Date, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an iffy element of can you/can’t you with games on Steam, even if they’re only available to buy on the platform. Some are only usable with a mouse and keyboard, as the configuration is easier to manage.</p>



<p>However, if you check the Mewgenics <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, you’ll clearly see a box in the right column saying ‘Full Controller Support,’ with <strong>Xbox Controllers</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Controllers</strong> listed, too.</p>



<p>Connecting a controller is easy, as you can do it either directly through a USB cable and looking for the device, or manually setting it up by connecting the controller and computer system using Bluetooth.</p>



<p>It’s as easy as training a cat, sort of.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-mewgenics-steam-deck-verified">Is Mewgenics Steam Deck Verified?</h2>



<p><strong>Steam Decks are compatible with Mewgenics, meaning you can play using your Steam console if you want.</strong></p>



<p>A little bonus question answered for you: Steam Deck verification is A-ok for Mewgenics!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics Release Date Countdown &amp; Exact Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Again, you’d think it would be self-explanatory, but not all games have Steam Deck support. Mewgenics does, and that’s all that meowtters for this query.</p>



<p>Check out the Steam compatibility evaluation:</p>



<p>“Valve’s testing indicates that Mewgenics is <strong>Verified </strong>on Steam Deck. This game is fully functional on Steam Deck, and works great with built-in controls and display.”</p>



<p>It’s always good to get the IG community’s thoughts on things like this: Do you prefer using a controller for Steam games? Or are you part of the PC master race who settle for nothing less than a mouse and keyboard?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A lengthy, 60-plus minutes Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week"><u>State of Play is heading our way this Thursday, February 12</u></a>, and promises new looks at “third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.” So, what upcoming games can we expect to see fresh reveals for and gameplay of? Well, here’s what we think is likely to show up, as well as a few out-there guesses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Exclusives</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as it's shaping up to be PlayStation’s biggest game of 2026, you’d perhaps have expected Wolverine to show up in Thursday’s stream. Well, a late spanner has been thrown into the works via Insomniac’s official X account, which claims that we won’t be seeing any more of its latest Marvel game until “Spring 2026”. Last time I checked, February was in Winter, so maybe we’ll have to wait a little longer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spring 2026.</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the last State of Play, back in September 2025, Insomniac Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Marvel’s Wolverine</u></a> in action. As one of Sony’s tentpole releases for this year, it certainly wouldn’t be a shock to see some more X-Men gameplay, as well as perhaps a release date for Logan’s latest adventure. Could we also catch a glimpse of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe"><u>Daredevil</u></a>, who has been teased to be making an appearance, too? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Studio’s first big exclusive of the year comes in the shape of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon"><u>Marathon</u></a>, Bungie’s extraction shooter, which will be looking to emulate the success of last year’s Arc Raiders. It’s been a bumpy road for the Destiny developer, such as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>plagiarism scandal</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>poor reception to its alpha</u></a>, but this week’s State of Play will be one of the last chances for it to convince players to hop into its world on March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in Spring, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros"><u>Saros</u></a>, Housemarque’s follow-up to Returnal, which will be dropping on April 30. We’ve seen it pop up regularly on recent State of Play streams, and it would make perfect sense to see it here, too, seeing as we’re only 10 weeks away from launch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another PS5 console exclusive is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls"><u>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</u></a>, the upcoming superhero fighting game from Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works. Due for release this year, the flashy-looking fighter suffered from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-roster-count-leaked-ahead-of-playstation-state-of-play"><u>an unfortunate leak earlier this week</u></a> that revealed a few key details about the game, such as the size of its roster. It would not be a shock to see some of this information officially confirmed as fact on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 console exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a> is a hotly anticipated wuxia action RPG coming from Chinese developer S-Game. The lead character is called Soul, so you can probably guess what genre this project borrows heavily from, too. It’s all looking very impressive, and maybe we’ll get yet another look at it in action this week ahead of its September 9 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the freshly revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc"><u>Horizon Hunters Gathering</u></a>, yet another spin-off of the mechanical monster-hunting series created by Guerrilla Games. A 3-player live-service co-op action game, it's getting its first playtest at the end of this month, so, again, it wouldn’t be a surprise if we were to get a further look at some gameplay in this State of Play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unveiled at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/4loop"><u>4:Loop</u></a> is a PS5 and PC exclusive that appears to infuse some roguelike elements with the co-op shooting of games like Helldivers and Left 4 Dead. That makes more sense when you consider that Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth is behind the project, working with Bad Robot Games, the video game wing of film director J.J. Abrams' production company. No release date has been given yet, but playtesting will start soon, with maybe a timing for that revealed at this State of Play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One exclusive that we don’t think is coming this year, but would certainly love to see more of, is Naughty Dog’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. The Last of Us and Uncharted studio’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure has gone very quiet since its initial reveal back at the 2024 Game Awards. So, is it time for a deeper look into what this new world has to offer? Let’s hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what the other PlayStation Studios are up to, your guess is as good as mine, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect one or two surprise reveals or updates. This State of Play stream is over an hour long, after all, so surely there’s something brand-new in there? Perhaps a look at the next project from God of War developer Sony Santa Monica, or a look into the world of Ghost of Yotei: Legends from Sucker Punch? Maybe the time is right for a first sighting of Gran Turismo 8, or an update on the development of Haven Studios’ Fairgames — if we don’t see this one soon, we’ll really start to get worried about it. Then there are two of Sony’s most creative studios, Media Molecule and Team Asobi. We’ve certainly been waiting a lot longer for a follow-up to Dreams than we have Astro Bot, but you never know what’s been going on behind those doors...</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplatform</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we see GTA 6 at this Sony State of Play? No. I will eat my whole fist if we do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a fair few other exciting games that we wouldn’t put body parts on the line for in terms of their likelihood, though. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> is imminent, so now seems like as good a time as any to show us one last slice of Leon Kennedy action before the big day on February 27. Sticking with survival horror, Konami has curiously announced a Silent Hill stream will be taking place just two hours after the State of Play. Is this a signal that a more in-depth look at a new Silent Hill game will be at that show, following its reveal just minutes prior as part of PlayStation’s stream? Perhaps this week is when we’ll see Bloober Team’s remake of the original in the series, or – more likely – our first proper look at the Annapurna-published Silent Hill: Townfall, which was first announced in 2022 and has been MIA since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back at Capcom briefly, and you can likely expect to see something from one of, if not both, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata"><u>Pragmata </u></a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword"><u>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</u></a>. Final Fantasy 7 remake director, Naoki Hamaguchi, recently teased that Square Enix will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director"><u>“share more updates than ever before”</u></a> about the project this year. Does that mean a potential reveal of the third part in the modernised RPG trilogy will happen at this State of Play? Or could we get an Intergrade-style bridging chapter as DLC for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, before we get too sidetracked, let’s stick with games closer on the horizon, such as Hitman developer IO Interactive's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight"><u>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</u></a> from Warner Bros. Games. Both are coming this May, and their respective developers could share further info on Thursday. Before those, though, March will bring with it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><u>Crimson Desert</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ ambitious open-world action-adventure that looks set to push the PS5 to its limits. No stranger to a trailer, we can likely expect it to turn up here, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra"><u>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</u></a> recently shifted out of its original window of early 2026 to “beyond early 2026”, so your guess is as good as mine as to when we’ll be playing Amy Hennig’s Captain America and Black Panther in World War 2 story. Legendary PlayStation hero Lara Croft will be returning in a “reimagining” of her original game, titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, and Finnish developer Remedy is back with another entry in its connected universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant"><u>Control: Resonant</u></a>. Also announced at The Game Awards was the pleasantly surprising <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer"><u>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</u></a> from the makers of Burnout and Need For Speed that is scheduled to drop in 2026. All of these are possibilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for indies, outside of the announcement of a PS5 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii"><u>Hades 2</u></a>, there are a few destined for PlayStation that I’d personally love to see more of on Thursday. Namely, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s coming of age story <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s"><u>Mixtape</u></a>, old-school cartoon-inspired shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouse-pi-for-hire"><u>Mouse P.I. For Hire</u></a>, and Japanese convenience store sim <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/inkonbini-one-store-many-stories"><u>inKONBINI: One Store. Many Stories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What game are you most looking forward to seeing more of at this week’s Sony State of Play?

            <guid>1432696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><u>gameplay from its Fable reboot</u></a> earlier this year in January’s Xbox Developer Direct, and among its viewers was the series’ original creator, Peter Molyneux. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently spoke to the former Lionhead Studios developer in anticipation of his new God game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, and took the opportunity to ask for his thoughts on what he saw from this new incarnation of Fable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up”, reveals Molyneux. “I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But… there’s always a but. Although there was plenty that the series’ original creator enjoyed in Playground’s grand unveiling, it didn’t completely hit the nail on the head for Molyneux — with the game's tone and visual design not quite to his tastes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, if I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it," Molyneux states. “But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But these minor quibbles with the current aesthetic certainly aren’t getting in the way of Peter looking forward to getting his hands on it when it arrives later this year. When asked if he plans to play Fable, he replied: “Absolutely. For sure. Not as someone looking for the flaws and faults, but as someone who truly loves and adores that universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I, too, cannot wait to jump back into the fairy tale world of Fable. You can check out all of the latest updates on Playground’s upcoming fantasy RPG here, including how it plans to utlilise a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-in-games-before-fable-will-use-a-storytelling-technique-borrowed-from-the-office"><u>surprising storytelling technique from The Office</u></a>, and how you’ll be able to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-bit-of-work-but-you-could-marry-them-all-fable-has-1000-handcrafted-npcs-for-you-to-play-around-with"><u>marry each and every one of its 1,000 NPCs</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>1432690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's all allowing players that freedom,” says Peter Molyneux. “And that's what we've been exploring with Masters of Albion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The god game thrives on freedom, and, arguably, is nothing without it. No one knows that better than Peter Molyneux. The lead developer of landmark god games such as Dungeon Keeper, Populous, and Black &amp; White, he’s returning to those roots after years away with Masters of Albion, a self-declared “culmination” of all his work to date that blends those god game greats with other milestones from a long career that also birthed Fable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freedom very much is the word I heard most often when speaking with Molyneux recently. His upcoming project, developed at his studio 22Cans, is not only inspired by his own vaunted library, but also by modern masterpieces that have reframed our understanding of player freedom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at the true greats, things like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom”, Molyneux reveals. “I wouldn't dare to say that our games are anywhere close to as good as those games, but I'm inspired by the fluidity, the seamlessness of those experiences. You're not going through level-up screens. It is just seamless. I'm really inspired by that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest two Zelda games are heralded for how reactive their versions of Hyrule are, and how their systems beg to be experimented with. You can see a similar ambition in the latest gameplay trailer for Masters of Albion, which showcases the numerous ways you can interact with the world of Albion. You can approach from many different perspectives, from the more traditional city building and infrastructure management layer, to RPG-esque missions full of sword and shield combat, to running the rule over its open world via a massive hand that floats over your townspeople as if The Addams Family’s Thing has risen to deity status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The hand really is the star of the show”, says Molyneux. “Giving players the ability to reach into a world, to manipulate things, to move things around, to combine things in ways that we may have never thought of is incredibly alluring for me and really fascinating to experiment with. And the interesting thing is, the more we develop this idea and the more we create it, the more other ideas come around the hand. There are some real surprises in that thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hand, of course, has played a starring role in Molyneux’s Black &amp; White games, but revisiting the concept has allowed 22cans to add a number of new surprises. Among them, I’m teased, is the ability to contort its four fingers, thumb, and palm into whichever shape you choose, and each and every occupant of Albion will react expressively to that. I’m not saying that you might want to raise only your middle digit up when confronting a tiny person who refuses to behave the way you’d like them to, but you do really want to, don’t you?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other, more playful ways to annoy your devoted townsfolk. Want to make a laughing stock of one of your villagers? Then have him parade around the streets dressed in armour made of sausages, created through the detailed factory system that allows you to substitute chainlink for chains of pork. This playfulness and sense of humour are things we’ve come to expect from Molyneux’s games, but crucially, all of these quirks play into Masters of Albion’s world systems, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only a flicking off device, the hand also plays into the surprisingly deep city-building side of things. This isn’t your standard “drop a mine near a valuable source of ore” situation, but one that lets you express yourself in the architectural design and colour of your buildings. While a snap-together block building system allows you to create towers and factories and housing complexes of your own design, be aware that your arrangements have consequences, including shifting your moral alignment — something familiar to any fan of the Black &amp; White series. But there will also be other, more surprising consequences that evoke the odd systems of Lionhead’s Fable days, such as the rather ominous-sounding arrival of a housing inspector…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> Molyneux explains that choices like colour and shape can cause a property inspection, and while he’s careful not to spoil the consequences of a failing grade, it sounds like something worth avoiding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">”You want to be careful that you don't trigger the housing inspector, because when [he] comes and he doesn't like that you've created a slum where everyone's packed together… he does not like that sort of stuff,” he teases.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Masters of Albion Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While things like the housing inspector will take time to occur in-world, Molyneux also wants to ensure that there’s instantaneous fun to be found in designing towns and individual buildings. He’s doing away with the genre staple construction timers, instead getting straight into the buffs and nerfs each new block might bring.</p><p>I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love playing city-building games, but I always get frustrated that I have to build a mine here and that's it,” Molyneux states, clearly frustrated by the time spent waiting for resources to start flowing. “[In Masters of Albion] you can build anything you want, anywhere you want, and it works immediately. There are no wait timers. If you've got a farm and you've got a mill and you've got a factory, you can say, ‘I'm just going to put them all into one building’ and you can make this thing that looks like Howl's Moving Castle with all these workstations for your workers, and it will work as you are building it. You don't have to wait for bricks to come to build it. I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Howl’s Moving Castle, there’s nothing rooting you to the spot. “You could go back to your original town, which is Oakridge, and you could say, ‘Do you know what? I'm going to move the whole of Oakridge to Wyrmscar, so I'm going to have everyone live in Wyrmscar.’ So this all comes back to god games being about freedom.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that freedom also needs direction, and that’s where Masters of Albion’s story comes into play. Launching into early access on April 22 will be chapter one of a planned trilogy, for which a full “epic” story is planned. While tales will play out in the world as you (literally) build it by hand, it appears the main thrust of its narrative structure can be found when Masters of Albion morphs more into a Fable-like shape, as you possess its heroes and venture out on RPG-like quests, slashing enemies down with a sword or turning them to dust with magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that we haven't done a good job of explaining is that there is a narrative story”, admits Molyneux. “It’s a huge epic story that winds through the entirety of the game. You saw a couple of times in the gameplay trailer that when the gold scroll was clicked on, that's a quest. If it's a gold scroll, it's on the golden line. It's a story quest. If it's a silver scroll, it's an optional quest.</p><p>We've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And all those quests, they give you more stuff”, he continues. “They may give you one of the currencies in the game, they may give you more blocks that you can build with, they may give you more parts that you can design things with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You'd be travelling through a land in Fable, and you'd see a chest, and you go and open that chest,” Molyneux explains. “We've got that in here. You can go and open a chest just like in Fable, you can stumble upon a scene that is playing out, and you can get involved in that scene. And so we've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion does sound ambitious, but ambition is something we’ve learned to take as a given from Molyneux’s work over the years. Whether these many complex, intertwining systems all come together and work in harmony is, of course, yet to be seen. I’m hopeful, though, because without big swings like Masters of Albion, genres such as the god game would be left to stagnate. That’s something Molyneux is highly aware of, due to the complex nature of their conception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's very hard, in my experience, to sit down and say, ‘Right, I'm going to design a god game.’ Because so much of it is the visceral feeling of connecting these gameplay systems together. It is a very frightening design process that you'd think, ‘Oh, I wish I could just make a first-person shooter. I know what a first-person shooter is.’ It's a terrifying development process to make a god game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion will be released into early access on April 22, 2026, and is available to wishlist now on Steam.

"I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for her and the design we ended up with," Andersen says in the video. "Because I think in her comic and the cinematic Elemental Kin, there was a precedent set by it.

<figure data-uuid="b5afdef867a31"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5afdef867a31/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a strange little concept. It's a life sim set in the Pokémon world where you, a humanoid Ditto, set out to rebuild a fallen civilisation with the help of your pocket monster pals. Weird, right? Where could the inspiration for that possibly have stemmed from? <em>Uhhh</em>, the GBA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>, it seems.</p>
<p>Game Freak's Shigeru Ohmori sat down with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/pokemon-pokopia/">VGC</a> at a recent Pokopia preview event in Tokyo and spilled the beans about how the project started. “When I was working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, I was continuously looking for new possibilities for Pokémon,” he said. “It brought me back to when I started on Ruby and Sapphire, creating those habitats and meeting the Pokémon for the first time. That led me to create the prototype for this game.”</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjgosqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Ohmori's first work on the series came in the early 2000s, when he was tasked with designing maps for the flagship Gen III titles. "When I was creating the map, which was 2D at the time, I was putting grass onto it where Pokémon would appear,” he told VGC, “that feeling of Pokémon appearing when I was creating the habitat was very interesting to me, and that feeling is something I cherish.”</p>
<p>You can see how such a feeling went on to inform Pokopia. This is, on a basic level, a game all about making habitats and watching Pokémon rock up to make the most of them. Later in the VGC discussion, Ohmori brought up Ruby and Sapphire's Secret Base building as a personal favourite non-battling series mechanic: "I would like to scale the Pokémon games in general, aside from battling. I will seek new possibilities to scale them.” It's a game inspired by the joys of that early game development — how sweet is that!</p>
<p>"Anything that the Pokémon does was carefully curated on the lore that already existed," game director Takuto Edagawa said in the same interview, "to ensure we didn’t break any of the past Pokémon canon.” It's the reason why we've seen Ditto dropping a punch bag to attract a Hitmonchan or a fishing rod to attract a Magikarp in the Pokopia trailers, so it might be worth getting clued up on your favourite Pokémon's likes/dislikes before diving in next month.</p>
<p>And it sounds like you'll want to dive in as soon as possible, if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear">our early preview</a> is anything to go by. "It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon," our Ollie Reynolds wrote, claiming that this could be the perfect antidote to the jaded Pokémon fan.</p>
<p>Pokémon Pokopia arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders </strong>wouldn't be an extraction shooter if <strong>Embark Studios</strong> didn't have people asking you to bring stuff back from your trips <strong>Topside</strong>. That's why there are plenty of <strong>quests</strong> you'll be asked to complete for each of the traders featured.</p>



<p>Though the actual tasks these quests require you to complete are relatively simple, they're not always simple to complete. Besides avoiding other players and ARCs to make it to your destination, if you're not thorough, you run the risk of needing multiple visits Topside just to get one objective completed. </p>



<p>This guide will run you through how to complete <strong>Apollo's</strong> '<strong>The League</strong>' quest, where you help Speranza's resident gadgets and grenades expert give football back to the people surviving through this dystopian world.</p>

<p>To start the quest, you need to find two things: a <strong>football</strong> and a <strong>bicycle pump</strong>. A football, because, well, obviously, you need one to play football, and a bicycle pump because none of the footballs you would find in this futuristic wasteland would have air in them.</p>



<p>Both are <strong>Residential </strong>items that can technically be found in any residential area on any map, but your best bet is to head straight to the <strong>Water Towers</strong> in <strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong>. You'll potentially find both a bicycle pump and a deflated football there in one go, but if you're strolling through residential areas on other maps, there's still a chance you'll find either one or both in the odd drawer. </p>



<p>Finding them isn't enough, though, as you'll need to extract back to Speranza safely for the objective to be considered complete. </p>

<p>This one is just in the name, and it's also why I advise you to look for a bicycle pump and a deflated football at the Water Towers before trying somewhere else. Once you're at the Water Towers, even if you can't find the other items, you'll be able to take the photo to complete the objective, which you can see in the screenshots above.</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, less straightforward than the previous picture-perfect challenge. Firstly, you'll need to head to <strong>Buried City</strong> to complete this objective, and you'll also need to be a bit lucky. You can find football magazines to photograph at any white kiosk building on the map, but it's not a guarantee. </p>



<p>In this case, it's possible that you run out of time looking into every kiosk, unable to find the right magazines, but just like with everything else in ARC Raiders, persistence is key. You should be able to find a kiosk with football magazines to photograph in a kiosk on the north side of <strong>Marano Station</strong>. If you can't find them there, you'll have to cross the map while keeping an eye out for every kiosk, but it shouldn't be an issue to find them at any of the Marano Station kiosks.</p>

<p>Once you've successfully extracted both items and taken both photos, speak to Apollo to be rewarded with <strong>5 Tagging Grenades, 5</strong> <strong>Fireworks,</strong> and a <strong>Faded Flush (Aviator Colour)</strong> cosmetic. </p>

            <p>At least 1,200 Ubisoft developers have gone on strike across Paris and Milan in response to the company’s recent massive cutbacks and change of policy towards remote-working. That’s the figure given for yesterday’s bout of strike action by Marc Rutschlé, Ubisoft Paris staffer and a representative of the union Solidaires Informatique, in a statement to the socialist agitators of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>The primary inspiration for this week’s strike is Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancellation or closure of several games and studios</a>, with total job losses still to be confirmed but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">likely to be in the hundreds</a>. The strikers are also pissed off about delayed or inadequate pay rises, together with Ubisoft’s new ban on remote or hybrid working (employees will get a yearly allowance of homeworking days instead). In general, they incline to the belief that Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is a big smelly bumface who should be looking for a new job.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Rutschlé said, in comments shared once again with the raving firebrands of GamesIndustry.biz. "The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year."</p>
<p>The strike is running for three days from 10th to 12th February. It follows a short-notice half-day strike on 22st January, the day after Ubisoft announced its latest round of restructuring. Solidaires Informatique and fellow unions STJV, CGT, Printemps Ecologique, and CFE-CGC put out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakqixmj2m">an international call for action</a> towards the end of last month, but Rutschlé says that so far, most of the strike action has taken place in France. </p>
<p>Godspeed, UbiStrikers! As we like to say across the Channel, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few Guillemot eggs.</p>

            <p>Warren! Warren! Warren!</p>
<p>ARRGGHHH! WHAAAA! HUHHHH! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/replaced">Replaced</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/release-date-for-dystopian-platformer-replaced-slips-to-2024">long-in-development dystopian platformer from Sad Cat Studios</a>, keeps shouting my last name at me. It might because the game's main character, a jacketed gap jumper and baddie shooter, is called Warren. It might also because I did plenty of falling and accidentally got shot by a robo-sniper in Replaced's demo, which is now live ahead of the full thing's release next month.</p>

<p>Replaced's demo is a medley of side-scroller platforming along deserted urban streets, battling small gangs of baddies, and using cover to avoid a big robo-light that'll blow your head off if it sees you. Warren, your typical Deckardy grizzled trench coat future fellow, is actually an artificial intelligence dubbed R.E.A.C.H. trapped in a human body.</p><p>His goal's to infiltrate the Phoenix Corporation, an evil cyberpunk corporation who run shit in the game's alternative version of 1980s America, which has been "reshaped by nuclear catastrophe". So, it's off to the corpo stronghold of Phoenix-City, via a trek down debris-strewn roads and through ruined buildings rendered in a more realistic art style that nicely blends with Warren's more pixellated rendering. That aesthetic's the aspect of the game I've found most appealing in the short romp the demo offers, though to be fair there's understandably only a minimal amount of story given away in the taster.</p>
<p>The platforming and shifting from cover to cover are serviceable, if occasionally prone to jumps which Warren treats more as a suggestion than an order. That said, when you do fall, it's usually only a short drop that's easy to recover from via a short run back to where you were. The combat, a mixture of melee thwacking and charged pistol finishers, with both feeling decently weighty and satisfying.</p>
<p>All in all, Replaced certainly one I'll consider giving a go in full when it releases on March 12th. Until then you can wishlist it and find the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p>Players who pre-ordered <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633">Capcom’s upcoming <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> through Amazon are discovering the scariest part of the survival horror sequel might not even be in the game. Instead, many are fearful to check their email and discover their order has been canceled.</p> <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is out February 27 on consoles and PC. And like every other major video game release of the last decade, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084"><em>Requiem</em></a> will come in a few different versions that players can pre-order ahead of time. One of these versions is a Deluxe Steelbook version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> that comes with all digital goodies you expect, like skins and costumes, as well as a hardy steelbook cover and some extra lenticular cards. A lot of people wanted this version of the game, leading to it selling out quickly. So when Amazon reopened pre-orders for it, people took advantage of the opportunity. But now many are reporting that their order of this version has been canceled due to a lack of supply.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1t57q/re_requiem_steelbook_amazon_order/">Checking the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1v3dk/everyone_check_your_emails/"><em>Resident Evil</em> subreddit today</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1t57q/re_requiem_steelbook_amazon_order/">you’ll find plenty of posts</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1vyv8/amazon_canceled_my_preorder/">from people sharing the horror</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1ull3/amazon_cancelled_deluxe_edition/">that their <em>Requiem</em> pre-order</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1u9gw/amazon_canceling_preorders_for_deluxesteelbook/">has been canceled</a>. It seems that many of these people ordered the Deluxe Steelbook edition of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> when Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r05k58/amazon_restocked_the_deluxe_editions_for_requiem/">recently opened up pre-orders again</a>. But Amazon seems to have sold more than Capcom was able to provide, and emailed many customers that it had canceled and refunded their order because it was no longer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1r1tmzn/re9_pre_orders/">“available from the supplier.”</a></p> <p>Other people who checked their order discovered that their pre-ordered copy of the Deluxe Edition was still shipping to them, but was now not arriving until weeks after launch in March. Meanwhile, a new version of the game has popped up on Amazon. This “Amazon Exclusive Edition” comes with a poster and seems to be the company’s replacement for the now-unavailable Deluxe Edition. However, if you want to play the latest <em>Resident Evil</em> sequel at launch, don’t buy this new edition, as it also won’t be delivered until March. “First time pre-ordering from Amazon. Never again,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qxuofb/first_time_preordering_from_amazon_never_again/">wrote one person</a> who shared a screenshot of their copy of the Amazon Exclusive Edition that won’t show up until March 28, nearly a month after launch. Ouch.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Amazon and Capcom about the situation. But for now, if you want to play <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> at launch, I’d buy a digital copy or avoid Amazon and shop somewhere else.</p>

<p>The Helldivers movie adaptation will reportedly be released on November 10, 2027, with more details revealed. </p>



<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers movies were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back at CES 2025</a>, and since then, we have received close to no new information.

The duo has also worked on the Twisted Metal and The Last of Us series, and will join hands for adaptations of Horizon and God of War. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/sinners-manga-robert-johnson-delta-blues-akira-hiramoto-prison-school/</link>
            <guid>1432615</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/sinners-is-an-exuberant-and-hypnotic-vampire-picture-that-will-rattle-your-bones-2000590728?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Sinners</u></em></a><em> </em>mania still has everyone craving more of Ryan Coogler’s world—an itch we’re unlikely to see scratched anytime soon outside of rewatches unless he feels generous to share tidbits about what <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ryan-coogler-sinners-prequel-smoke-stack-2000715470?ref=aftermath.site"><u>characters were up to before the film</u></a>. So instead of waiting for a sequel that will never happen or sprinting to AO3 in search of spiritual continuations, there’s a manga that hits the same nerve in an equally sinister register.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Me and the Devil Blues</em> is an underappreciated and, let’s be honest, criminally under-discussed horror manga, inspired by the life of&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Robert Johnson</u></a>. Johnson is a legendary, famously elusive bluesman who was the unofficial first member of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club?ref=aftermath.site"><u> 27 Club</u></a>, leaving behind 29 songs, three photographs, and a legacy that reaches from the 1930s to the present, shaping musicians like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/03/30/1798862/eric-clapton-takes-on-robert-johnsons-blues?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Eric Clapton</u></a> and <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/first-time-bob-dylan-heard-robert-johnson/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bob Dylan</u></a> in his wake. But by far one of the most famous legends about Johnson, perpetuated by fellow musician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_House?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Son House</u></a>, is that he went from being a terrible guitarist to a transcendent one overnight after striking a deal with the devil. And it's that tale that the manga leans in on hard.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Akira Hiramoto/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>Said tale begins with Johnson as a soon‑to‑be father. But instead of spending time with his family, he sneaks out to the local juke joint with the stated goal (read: excuse) to learn lullabies for his unborn child. The truth is simpler: he wants to become the best bluesman on Earth. The problem is he’s terrible—so bad that he gets clowned on for souring their spirits every time he attempts to strum his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobro?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dobro</u></a>. But when he accidentally recreates a rumored ritual wherein someone plays the guitar at the crossroads of a street and has their wishes granted, he miraculously becomes a genius bluesman overnight. However, the bargain he absentmindedly makes with the devil quickly becomes a curse that’ll follow him no matter where he runs or hides. And the manga punishes his naïveté with a horror‑tinged odyssey across the Delta filled with gangsters, racists, and plenty of things to sing the blues over.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Akira Hiramoto/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>Across 38 chapters, the story unspools Johnson’s myth while stitching in some of its own embellishments. From my estimation, it feels more like Takehiko Inoue’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Vagabond </u></em></a>than any run-of-the-mill biopic. It’s a tale with the style and brutality people often full-throatedly credit to Quentin Tarantino, except here the violence and liberal use of the n-word feel earned and not self-indulgent. Visually, the manga is a surreal, almost magical, realistic take on the era—an era my own grandmother lived through—showcased with an unflinching depiction of racism, lynching culture, and the everyday terror of being Black in the Jim Crow South. And despite the conceit of the manga's wanton fiction, it doesn’t handwave the history of the times; it threads itself through the gaps, riffing on the legend the way a bluesman would pull universal pain to the surface as music for listeners to seek refuge in.&nbsp;</p><p>The series front‑loads what little we know about Johnson, filling in the gaps with a folkloric exaggeration that feels truer to the kayfabe of his myth than any biopic ever could. It pulls songs like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd60nI4sa9A&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cross Road Blues</u></a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2-AYZ-0b0Y&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day</u></a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAIgpih86E&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hell Hound on My Trail</u></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MCHI23FTP8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Me and the Devil Blues</u></a>” into the narrative as if they were already spoken‑word scripture bleeding through the ink of the manga’s illustrations. And it does so without leaning drawing Black folks like one-note caricatures of themselves that most manga fall prey to; instead, it renders Johnson’s world with a grounded, lived‑in respect that’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/viz-medias-one-shots-program-wants-to-make-manga-for-everyone-2000530772?ref=aftermath.site"><u>rare in manga</u></a>, making both its real world and supernatural fixings feel eerily plausible—as if the devil really were guiding Johnson’s hand with every hypnotic strum.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Akiira Hiramoto/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the series does take a detour in its middle half, sidelining Johnson for a stretch to follow his white gangster companion on a separate, anxiety-fueled adventure that goes from <em>Django </em>to <em>Black Phone</em> real quick. But unlike other works that lose themselves in grand, fantastical pivots—cough, <a href="https://sugargamers.com/why-netflixs-yasuke-misses-the-mark/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Yasuke</u></em></a>—it never wholly forgets the story it’s telling. If anything, the liberties the manga takes bend Johnson’s legend, but never so far as to break it.</p><p>Despite being a monochrome medium where music can’t literally be heard, the manga finds ways to make Johnson’s songs resonate. Chapters named after his tracks unfold like movements in a Greek‑tragedy‑style retelling from memory. But it also didn’t hurt reading with his recordings playing in the background, adding a whole new, haunting, <em>Sinners</em>‑adjacent layer to the experience. Like <a href="https://www.bluegiant.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Blue Giant</u></em></a>, <em>Me and the Devil Blues</em> effectively captures the emotional truth of music—but here, the notes are in a dreamlike flurry of artwork that makes it feel as if something wicked is keeping the rhythm of Johnson’s life in time.</p><figure><figcaption><span>AKira Hiramoto/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>And just as the story reaches its most dire crossroads for Johnson, the manga plunged into indefinite hiatus in 2017, long before Young Magazine shuttered in 2021. Even with the magazine’s 2025 revival for American audiences, the odds of the series returning are slim, especially given the creator’s current pursuits.</p><p>And that creator? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Hiramoto?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Akira Hiramoto</u></a>—the same mangaka behind ecchi manga classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-tried-to-start-watching-anime-in-the-worst-way-possible/1100-6495935/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Prison School</u></em></a>, <em>Raw Her</em>o, and <em>Super Ball Girls</em>. That’s right. Whatever compelled him to write such a bespoke horror manga about a Black blues musician before making his bank in all kinds of trash (complimentary) debauchery is anyone’s guess. But old buddy draws Black folks and draws horror exceedingly well.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Akira Hiramoto/Kodansha/Yen Press</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for a manga that engages Black history without reducing it to a backdrop for someone else’s story—or flattening it into a simple “music narrative”—<em>Me and the Devil Blues</em> is a series you’re unfortunately gonna have to hunt down. It’s not available through Kodansha, so you’ll have to scour the internet for it, like it's lost media, because it honestly is.</p><p><em>Me and the Devil Blues</em> is far from a flawless, must‑read recommendation, but where it sings is as a more than serviceable add-on to his legend. If anything, the manga opens a path for readers to want to learn more about the man behind the myth and how his influences echo in places you would’ve otherwise not have known about. The added bonus that it’s by a mangaka who forever put the <a href="https://youtu.be/5qLYAFdddPw?ref=aftermath.site"><u>boobs vs asses debate</u></a> to rest is something I’m sure would make the Devil himself chuckle.</p>

<p>Or maybe FireRed and LeafGreen?</p>

<figure data-uuid="ac61c31bd8847"><a title="Pokemon Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac61c31bd8847/pokemon-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations underway, fans are quite rightly curious about how Nintendo and The Pokémon Company might acknowledge the games that started it all.</p>
<p>Yes, without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a> (and Green), there would be no Pokémon and no 30th anniversary celebrations. Almost 10 years ago for the 20th anniversary, classic Pokémon games were added to the 3DS eShop on 27th February 2016. Users could buy these à la carte, long before Nintendo started to lean on subscription models for its retro games, and it made for an appropriate way to acknowledge the important milestone.</p>
<p>A new, unsubstantiated rumour from known Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331">Riddler_Khu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-may-be-returning-on-switch-2-for-30th-anniversary/">Vice Gaming</a>) suggests that Nintendo might be gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> on the Switch for the 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether these might be available via Nintendo Switch online or as standalone purchases (or, indeed, whether it's even a remotely credible claim at all), but it would make for a substantial addition to the GBA catalogue. Certainly, it would convince many Switch Online subscribers to upgrade to the more expensive Expansion Pack tier.</p>
<p>Whether this claim from Riddler_Khu is credible or not (and history suggests that their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/rofbyn/is_khu_even_trustworthy_anymore/">trustworthiness is sketchy at best</a> these days), it's nevertheless inspired us to speculate on whether classic Pokémon games will make a return for the 30th anniversary. And if they will, in what form should they take?</p>
<p>So, let us know what you think, dear readers, by voting in the below polls and leaving a comment in the usual place.</p>

            <guid>1432591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the start of 2026, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> didn't just announce layoffs at one of its studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">which is how it started 2025</a>). It announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>,"</a> which included layoffs at multiple studios, the shuttering of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Ubisoft Halifax</a></strong>, the cancellation of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, and significant changes to its operating structure, alongside some unpopular new policies like a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">return-to-office mandate</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The response to these changes has not exactly been positive, both internally within Ubisoft and externally across the industry. On the stock market, the announcement of the restructure saw the company's stock price drop <strong>34%</strong>, which officially saw Ubisoft lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value</strong> in just eight years.</a> When this restructuring was followed by the introduction of a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">voluntary redundancy program</a></strong> at Ubisoft's headquarters in Paris, which aimed to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong>, employees decided they had had enough.</p>



<p>French union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several employees at Ubisoft Paris, announced plans for an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">international strike</a></strong>, calling on Ubisoft employees at branches across the globe to walk out and strike on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12.</strong> Yesterday, February 10, 2026, was the first day of the strike, and according to Solidaires Informatique (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), <strong>at least 1,200 Ubisoft employees walked out yesterday to participate in the strike.</strong></p>



<p>Most of the striking employees came from within France, with some of the striking workers also coming from the Milan branch. It's a strong show of force from Ubisoft employees, who have been calling out the company's leadership, specifically chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, as the responsible party for the studio's woes.</p>







<p>Employees are still on strike today, and will be for the remainder of the week. This is also not the only demonstration that has already happened, as former staff from the now-shuttered Halifax branch held a rally last month in response to their studio getting suddenly shut down.</p>



<p>Solidaires Informatique already hosted a smaller strike last month that it called an "<em></em><em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions."</em> Solidaires Informatique representative, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, also added, "<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bonfire Studio’s Mix of Diablo, PUBG, and Dark Souls, Arkheron, Will Get a Steam Next Fest Demo Ahead of Launch Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bonfire-studios-mix-of-diablo-pubg-and-dark-souls-arkheron-will-get-a-steam-next-fest-demo-ahead-of-launch-later-this-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Arkheron</strong>, the interesting and ambitious blend between <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/">PUBG</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-re-remastered-mod-new-version/">Dark Souls</a></strong> from <strong>Bonfire Studios</strong>, which we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkheron-is-an-ambitious-and-intriguing-mix-of-diablo-dark-souls-and-pubg/">got a look at last September</a>. It will have its first public playtest via the launch of a brand new demo arriving on <strong>February 20, 2026,</strong> just ahead of the first <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> of 2026, which will officially kick off three days later on February 23.</p>



<p>The news of the new demo also came along with a new trailer, where Bonfire Studios takes players through some of its plans for Arkheron as the team gets closer to launch, and some of the changes and updates players who've previously participated in the game's alpha playtest weekends will notice.</p>



<p>Introduced in the demo will be two new Eternal item sets that Bonfire will reveal just ahead of the demo's actual release, though with that also means two current sets players are already familiar with will be removed for the demo. They're not going away permanently; it's just a switch Bonfire is making for now, and since part of the fun in Arkheron is mixing and matching items and abilities to create more powerful characters, it's all part of Bonfire giving players as many options on how to play as possible.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Arkheron Returns for Next Fest and Closed Beta" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XWBE5yCbrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo also arrives with a new patch for the game, version <strong>0.16,</strong> which adds a new tutorial, regional server selections, environmental updates and the ability to go back through your recent teammates if you want to keep playing with someone you randomly met through the game.</p>



<p>Once the demo goes live on February 20, players will be able to jump in 24/7 until <strong>March 2, 2026,</strong> when the demo goes offline. If Arkheron strikes you as something you want to keep playing, however, Bonfire is hosting another <strong>closed beta</strong> to help the studio further refine the game ahead of launch. The closed beta will introduce a ranked mode and will be focused on ensuring the game's competitive progression is finely tuned.</p>



<p>You will need to be sent a key to access the closed beta, so if you're enjoying Arkheron during Steam Next Fest, make sure to sign up for the closed beta to potentially participate in it.</p>

<figcaption>The tutorial does a good job of guiding you through the basics and introducing you to the world. Your charming starter home certainly doesn't hurt, either!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Returning Home</h2><p>As is typical for the genre, <em>Starsand Island</em> starts by giving you the basics — character creation, a short story introduction, a small plot of land, and a serviceable tutorial. This game also maintains the tradition of a high amount of player freedom; once you've started, you have a lot of different ways to play.</p><p>A central aspect of <em>Starsand Island </em>is its profession system. There are five Professions in total — <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-crafting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d06320e2-d098-442b-862b-cc5a7b880f1f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-farming" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1aeb3b5b-3678-439b-8ff5-bcceb96f1b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">farming</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-fishing-guide-fish-list" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc294a1e-1a2d-4599-80fb-5ccdee4f307a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fishing</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-ranching" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33313204-45f2-4ad0-a830-46657fcf40b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ranching</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-exploration" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f81fb0e-0351-4f4d-bfb6-86178e7ee5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">exploration</a> — and each of them has unique quest chains that allow you to advance deeper into their respective crafting trees.</p><blockquote><p>Starsand Island lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p></blockquote><p>Crafting, in particular, is essential to life on the island, and this is why the tutorial recommends that you work on it first. You'll need to use the workbenches and crafting materials you make with the crafting profession to create equipment for the other four professions at one point or another, unless you want to do things the slow way.</p><p>That's not to say the profession system is overly restrictive, mind. I started the quest chains for all five professions and played through them concurrently, bouncing back and forth based on my interests at the time. <em>Starsand Island </em>lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can farm as much or as little as you'd like, but it's labor intensive to do it at scale until you unlock better tools and get the materials to make them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Growing Your Farm</h2><p>Naturally, farming is a big part of a game like this. <em>Starsand Island</em> offers a fairly robust farming system with seasonal crops, fruit trees, and multiple ways to plant your favorite foods. The pacing with this particular profession, however, is a little bit unusual.</p><p>Any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> veteran worth his salt will tell you that sprinklers are essential to farming at scale, and you can usually start to make them fairly early. Conversely, <em>Starsand Island</em> buries the required equipment about halfway through the farming and crafting professions, respectively; it takes quite some time to get there.</p><p>You'll need a fair amount of materials to make sprinklers, too, and that means a <em>lot</em> of runs into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-moonlit-forest-map-mining" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f6e5d31-1253-4ac8-93bf-3b367a1048ca" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Moonlit Forest</a> to go mining for resources. Essentially, having the most basic of automation on your farm requires a fair amount of progress in three of the five professions.</p><p>Farming gets easier as you go, but it's not quite the cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-make-money-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db0a0c64-2a9f-4840-bb10-50b7b8479970" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moneymaker</a> that you'd expect from some other Farming RPGs. Sowing, watering, weeding, and harvesting crops are all done one at a time until you can progress deeper into multiple professions and craft yourself some better equipment.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Though it has its limitations, the building system lets you reach a level of detail better than you'd normally expect from a game like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Building Your Homestead</h2><p>One of <em>Starsand Island's</em> most notable features is its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-building" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cfa93844-ef2b-4c84-a0d9-a024896405ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">building system</a>. Many games in the Farming RPG and survival genres allow you to build structures piece by piece, but <em>Starsand Island</em> gives you what I believe to be one of the most robust building systems ever seen in a game of this style.</p><p>You're automatically given a cozy one-room, Asian-style shack as your home. It has enough space for the basics, but you might want to expand if you want to avoid having dozens of crafting stations strewn about on your front lawn. This is where you have two choices: layouts and free building.</p><blockquote><p>In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p></blockquote><p>If desired, you can purchase a pre-made layout and simply plop it down on some empty land. There are a few choices of varying architectural styles, and you can additionally modify the design yourself once it's placed.</p><p>The much more attractive option (to me, at least) is the free building system. You can place blocks, roof pieces, doors, and windows piece by piece. You can scale them to larger sizes. You can change their texture. You can build yourself a simple grey box for your stuff, or you can spend hours building the perfect home.</p><p><em>Starsand Island</em> takes things even further with its decorations. In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>None of the regular enemies or minibosses are particularly challenging; they soon turn into more of an annoyance than an actual challenge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Fighting Through the Forest</h2><p>Peaceful as it may seem, this beautiful island paradise is not free from conflict. The Moonlit Forest pulls double duty as both the main dungeon and the mines, and you're going to have to visit it a lot to get all of the raw materials you need to advance your professions and make useful equipment.</p><p>The Moonlit Forest is one of the weaker areas of <em>Starsand Island</em> in its current state. You can run end-to-end and encounter fewer than 10 enemies and a grand total of three minibosses. Combat doesn't feel particularly challenging, either.</p><p>Though lacking in enemies, the Moonlit Forest more than makes up for it with an abundant amount of unique plants, trees, and raw ore. These items spawn in the same place every day, and you'll likely find yourself visiting the same spots daily to collect another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-upgrade-your-backpack-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbf3814c-7ff0-4758-bfdd-6963d3b2ffe9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">backpack</a> full of iron or gold.</p><p>Mining in the Moonlit Forest was always one area where I never felt like I had enough time or energy. If I needed certain materials, I'd easily burn up half of my day slogging through the dungeon to get everything I need. This aspect of <em>Starsand Island</em> could do with some improvement in the future.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Strangely, the relationships system doesn't yet make any mention of romance or marriage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Forging Friendships</h2><p>The one element I haven't yet addressed in <em>Starsand Island</em> is the friendship system. There are friendship meters, a gifting system, and a way to hire certain townspeople to work for you once you've advanced your relationship enough.</p><p>That said, there's a near-total lack of meaningful story development with any of the characters, outside of the mentors you interact with during the five profession quest chains. There isn't much in the way of heart events or unique stories to uncover from what I've seen.</p><blockquote><p>Maxing out a friendship meter allows you to invite your "friend" to move in with you — a feat I've yet to achieve — but there is no clear language on romance or marriage just yet. It's a strange omission.</p></blockquote><p>In Seed Sparkle Lab's defense, this is one of the elements that many Farming RPGs tend to roll out in stages. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fields-of-mistria" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f307c748-d146-4487-92e4-644ef6216cf5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>, for example, only had the most basic of story events in its Early Access launch version; many other games in this space tend to use the same playbook.</p><p>I am further confused by the vague language surrounding romance.

<h2><em>Starsand Island</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>All in all, <em>Starsand Island</em> is definitely one of the better Early Access Farming RPGs that I've played in recent years. The few bugs I've encountered have been relatively small, and many of them were fixed in the course of my time with a pre-launch version of the game.</p><p>While it's currently a little weak on the story and combat aspects, <em>Starsand Island</em> is mechanically robust, engaging, and — most importantly — fun. The building system is especially entertaining to me, and I struggled to resist the urge to spend countless hours building out the island home of my dreams.</p><p>As always, the main concerns with an Early Access game are how fast it can squash bugs and deliver new content. As important as this is, what you'll get with the Early Access launch version is an estimated 100 hours of gameplay. I'd wager you'd get even more than that if you take your time to enjoy it.</p><p>I'm excited to see how <em>Starsand Island</em> grows and develops in the coming months. If you're a fan of Farming RPGs and life sims (or if you're even remotely interested in these genres), then I can confidently say that <em>Starsand Island</em> is the first must-play game of the year in this space. Give it a chance — you won't be disappointed.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Starsand Island</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 85 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Czech indie developers Amanita Design – creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/samorost">Samorost</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creaks">Creaks</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/machinarium">Machinarium</a>, among other marvels – have released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4109130/Phonopolis_Demo/">a demo for Phonopolis</a>, their 3D cardboard adventure about a young man called Felix who is trying to save a city brainwashed by massive loudspeakers. Protected by his headphones, Felix is on a mission to stop the authoritarian Leader from issuing the Absolute Tone, which will “strip every citizen of their humanity forever”. Seems like a thing to avoid!</p>
<p>I relate intensely to Felix at the moment, because I’m having trouble with my lugholes and can barely hear anything. Thank to the magic of medicinal drops, I, too, am proof against sonic mind control, but also, I am feeling more than usually susceptible to assassination. A marching band could backstab me right now. It’s not clear from the Steam page whether Felix’s indispensable headphones leave him similarly vulnerable. I guess we’ll have to play the demo to find out.</p>
<p>“With Felix becoming immune to the commands, you’ll be able to take advantage of the loudspeakers and use them to solve puzzles involving other characters,” the developers explain. “Other times, you will interact with the cardboard environment in surprising, often unexpected ways—turn walls, shuffle floors, control various machinery or tear paper curtains. Each puzzle is carefully integrated into the world and presents a different challenge.” </p>
<p>Those cardboard sets – all based on physical, hand-painted sets, with animations capping out at 12 FPS in mimicry of stop-motion film – certainly do look very inviting. But hang on, what’s this? Felix can “take advantage” of the very same loudspeakers that have subjugated his fellow citizens? The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house, Amanita!</p><p>Being an Amanita joint, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phonopolis">Phonopolis</a> is openly steeped in art history. “The art style is strongly influenced by avant-garde artistic trends of the interwar period such as constructivism, futurism, and suprematism, and their societal impact as a tool of propaganda,” the Steam page goes on.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of isms, more than is generally advisable, but I trust them to stick the landing. There’s also a sentence about the soundtrack, but I can offer no further comment there because, as of writing, you could set fire to a sackful of lions in my vicinity and I’d be none the wiser. Do your worst, *checks TV Tropes*... Jesse Custers of the world! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206070/Phonopolis/">The full version</a> of Phonopolis releases sometime this year.</p>

Not bad considering it was, at one point, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-overwatch-2-patch-notes-season-6-battle-pass-1850729064"><span>one of the lowest-reviewed games on the platform</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>That said, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is a multiplatform game, and a lot of PC players use Battle.net anyway, so that’s only a small slice of the people who flooded the servers yesterday. I actually had to wait in a queue for probably the first time since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch in 2022. But once I got in, I immediately queued up as my longtime mains while everyone else was trying out the new heroes like a hydrogen bomb descending upon a coughing baby. I kid, mostly. I did put in a fair bit of time as Mizuki, the new support who throws his not-magic hat around the field to heal his teammates. Thankfully, the first night wasn’t </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>mirror matches of the five new heroes the whole time, as a lot of people just logged on to play as their main for a few matches.</span></p>

 <p><span>But in the midst of all those matches, my friends who had long been skeptics of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s return in a post-PvE cancelation world were hootin’, hollerin’, and admitting that the game “might be good” again. To which I say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><span>I told you so</span></a><span>. I’m glad to see so many people coming back and seeing how Blizzard managed to salvage a game after years of mismanagement and corporate sabotage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, we’re probably in a honeymoon phase. The new heroes have injected a bunch of chaos into the mix, and viral clips of ridiculous plays with the tether-sporting Jetpack Cat are spreading like wildfire. When the dust settles, we’ll probably talk about hero balance again, and Blizzard may rein in some of these antics, but it feels good to see </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>so reinvigorated all at once. This isn’t solely a result of the influx of new playable heroes, but also of the fact that Blizzard is pretty committed to its story integration. We’ve gotten what feel like weekly lore updates, and even gotten another audio drama starring Freja and newcomer Emre that is actually feeding into the internal push and pull between Vendetta and those who have been part of the terrorist organization Talon.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fans have been discovering new layers to characters’ relationships through both the lore drops and the new dialogue before matches. There’s a lot of interpersonal drama with actual momentum now, with characters talking to each other about the state of the world after Vendetta defeated Doomfist, and maps like Watchpoint Gibraltar and Colesseo changing things in the environment and layout as part of the current narrative.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the best character stuff is, unsurprisingly given the theme of the season, coming from the characters who have defected from Talon. Sombra, Reaper, and Widowmaker are on the run after Vendetta’s hostile takeover, and dialogue implies that they’re all part of a tenuous partnership without the Talon banner uniting them.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Widowmaker and Sombra interaction!</p> <p>"Not like I didn't warn the boss, but hard to believe Vendetta is starting a war." <a href="https://t.co/i4O5BjkXqz">pic.twitter.com/i4O5BjkXqz</a></p> <p>— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/2021456512238092617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the most devastating subplots revealed in the game’s dialogue is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-hero-is-sigma-an-astrophysicist-who-doe-1836605852"><span>Sigma’s</span></a><span>. The mad scientist character has been conspicuously absent from the season’s cinematic, comic, and audio dramas, but he is also a member of Talon. However, it sounds like Vendetta views him more as a danger to be held captive, and he misses his friend Sombra, who had to cut and run. If Sigma kills Sombra in a match, he utters a devastated </span><a href="https://x.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021460992421658892"><span>“But I still need you,”</span></a><span> or solemnly wonders where his friend has gone. That shit hurts real good. The </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>website has updated several of its heroes’ story blurbs and </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes/sombra/"><span>confirms that Sombra is “keeping a careful eye” on Talon</span></a><span> while Sigma is imprisoned, so maybe a jailbreak is in order later down the season?</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So remember how Sigma kinda got no mentions during the setup for this new season besides a new lore blurb today? Turns out…he is not happy <a href="https://twitter.com/OW2voicelines?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OW2voicelines</a> </p> <p>RELEASE MY GOAT! RELEASE HIM <a href="https://t.co/iJB0hhFz5C">pic.twitter.com/iJB0hhFz5C</a></p> <p>— Jetpack Uniwatch (@UniwatchOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021413869986644446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s not all angst, though. The slew of new hero interactions is giving fans a lot to work with in terms of understanding new, budding relationships. Where once </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>said shipping </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-shipping"><span>wasn’t a priority</span></a><span> in its worldbuilding, there are a bunch of characters with romantic tension in 2026, and that rocks, actually. Lifeweaver and Baptiste feel like they blazed a trail for heroes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ptr-lifeweaver-season-4-baptiste-new-hero-1850300708"><span>to start flirting</span></a><span> in pre-matches, and now that the story actually has momentum, maybe ships like Wuyang and Juno or Kiriko and Mizuki can go somewhere. We’re already getting a lot of Freja and Emre, who seem to be canonically ex-lovers, so let’s spread the love, Blizzard. Except for Soldier: 76, who will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-month-parade-soldier-76-vincent-skin-1851785385"><span>likely remain a yearner</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BYE MILKYWAVE IS REAL, I TOLLDDD U BRUH I TOLLDD UUUU <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/milkywave?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#milkywave</a> <a href="https://t.co/DTF7gppUNV">pic.twitter.com/DTF7gppUNV</a></p> <p>— korti 🍪 (@PPYCH0W) <a href="https://twitter.com/PPYCH0W/status/2021391556033294756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Overall, it’s kind of wild to feel like there’s reason to hope for </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> again. The PvE campaign didn’t pan out, but the game we have feels more focused and dedicated to delivering a story with momentum, an ever-evolving competitive game with new heroes shaking things up every season, and in-game events to keep people showing up all year. It feels like we’re back in 2016 when the possibilities seemed endless. Here’s hoping Blizzard makes the most of this fresh start.</span></p>

              <p>Poor&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after having a pretty smooth run from launch until the end of 2025, has since started springing leaks faster than developers Embark Studios can plug them up. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-permanent-bans-cheaters-stream-sniping-2000660615">cheating scandals</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-dup-glitch-hotfix-patch-1-15-2000667320">item-duplication glitches</a> that have been pissing off its player base, it now seems the latest update has introduced both a weapon-repairing glitch and a way to make infinite ammo. And worse, they’re both incredibly easy to pull off.</p> <p>Usually when we see reports of a new way of glitching something in an online game, it turns out to be an action so complicated that only the most elite and dedicated players would ever even try. Unfortunately, that’s very much not the case in the latest issues to plague the excellent extraction shooter. It’s as simple and clicking back and forth in your inventory, then dropping and picking up weapons. And that means everyone’ll be doing it.</p>

 <p>Brought to wide attention by X user @genos, both the weapon-fixing and ammo-generating glitches use much the same technique. If you have a couple of worn weapons and want them repaired, all you need to do is rapidly switch them between your two weapon slots and for some reason their numbers start to climb. To make this stick, you then need to drop the weapon on the floor and pick it up again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW REPAIR GLITCH IN ARC RAIDERS. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <a href="https://t.co/GCKXkAXL3K">pic.twitter.com/GCKXkAXL3K</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021383166955786342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weapons wear down in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in order to prevent players from being able to overly rely on a particularly expensive, particularly powerful choice, which would reduce the sense of danger when on a raid. It’s a crucial part of the game’s already shaky balance, as much as it might annoy a player in the moment. As such, being able to fix up the most costly, most dangerous guns means people are able to become significantly overpowered, stepping over systems designed to keep things in check.</p>

 <p>This is then made worse by the accompanying glitch, where those constantly top-notch weapons also need never run out of bullets to fire. Again, the top-tier arms have very scarce, expensive ammo, designed to restrict use and prevent domination. But by swapping weapons over, not only do they get repaired, but they’ll also fill an ammo slot. Do this, drop the weapon, pick it up, unload it, drop the ammo and pick that up again, and it’s yours to keep. And yes, this is much more cumbersome, and hardly useful for a rapid-fire automatic weapon, but when it comes to something like a Hullcracker with its super-rare explosive projectiles, it’s a huge issue. And it gets far worse.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST FOUND NEW MONEY GLITCH FOR AMMO LOL <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <a href="https://t.co/r4t5oYin41">pic.twitter.com/r4t5oYin41</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021399834125836455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It turns out if you use the swapping trick on guns like the Anvil and the Venator, you end up with 102 bullets loaded in guns that are supposed to only hold six and 22 bullets respectively. You can also get the 35-bullet rapid-firing Bobcat to load itself with 102 rounds, which is wildly OP. In a shoot-out, this is obviously a massive advantage, and unlike the ammo-duping glitch above, it’s trivially easy to do. Given that, who&nbsp;<em>wouldn’t</em> load up with 102 bullets, even if they’re just trying to take on the machines?</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NAH THIS INFINITE AMMO GLITCH IS FUCKING BROKEN <a href="https://twitter.com/EmbarkStudios?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmbarkStudios</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaiderAlerts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArcRaiderAlerts</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/THump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@THump</a> <a href="https://t.co/IGgreMZXWE">pic.twitter.com/IGgreMZXWE</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021415495715651812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> doesn’t have anything like betwixt-player trading markets, so no one’s getting taken advantage of by these schemes, and as such there’s no internal economy that’s broken by such exploits. (There <em>is</em> unofficial trading in-game, where you can swap out items with people you encounter, and this can be exploited for ill gains, but it’s not going to cause major harm.) The issue is far more about an individual player’s progress being artificially boosted, with them able to sell ammo to in-game traders for extra cash, and especially for PVP players getting far better equipped when battling other people.</p>

 <p>I imagine we’ll see an emergency hotfix rolled out pretty sharpish, but in the meantime, perhaps focus on the freshly released <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">Shared Watch event</a> where players are encouraged to work together to fight the machines. And remember, the game’s matchmaking deliberately assigns you to games with players of a similar temperament, so if you’re PVP-averse, you’re far more likely to be put into lobbies with raiders of a similar nature.</p>

<p>The director of Pokémon Pokopia has revealed how many hours players would spend in the game and that experiences await after the end credits. </p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the Switch 2 during the Pokémon Presents showcase last year. Since then, we have received the March 4 release date for the title and a new trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-trailer-reveals-new-pikachu-snorlax-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Pikachu and Snorlax variants</a>. Also, a leak has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the theory</a> about Pokémon Pokopia taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.Now, the developers have finally revealed some new information about the upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-will-be-about-20-40-hours-long">Pokémon Pokopia Will be About 20-40 Hours Long</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/pokemon-pokopia/252940/news/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-dire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Pokémon Pokopia director Takuto Edagawa discussed the gameplay hours for the upcoming title and the experiences after the end credits. Edagawa explained that the title’s motive is “typically not to go to the end roll [credits].” The concept is to craft a world where you can spend your time with Pokémon. </p>



<p>However, on average, the title is expected to take 20 to 40 hours, though it really depends on how players approach it. Players will have “more things to experience after the end roll [credits].” The director believes players will be encouraged and motivated to keep playing the game after the end credits. Do you want more content, or does 20 to 40 hours seem enough? </p>







<p>In other news, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return has been teased</a> by a leaker. Additionally, the developers have revealed how players on the original Nintendo Switch can join the fun, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but there’s a catch</a>.
