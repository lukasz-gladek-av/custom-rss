		<p>Nintendo has shared a fresh 15-minute look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in a dedicated Nintendo Direct stream. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive kart racing sequel is coming out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">alongside the new console on 5th June</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct – 17/04/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Cze7usEGCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct gave us a deeper dive into what this new entry in the long-running karting series will offer. From the game reveal a couple weeks ago we already learned about the larger 24-player races, the shift to an open world that’s filled with race circuits that you actually race between as part of many Grand Prix events, the new Knockout Tour mode, and plenty more.</p>
<p>There were also plenty of teases in the trailer, subsequent Treehouse Live showcase and hands on events, such as snacking on food to unlock new character costumes – they transform you mid-race but are then unlocked for the rest of the game – rail grinding and wall-jumping, new water vehicle transformations, the ability to commandeer some world vehicles, and more.</p>
<p>The Direct runs through the basics, such as picking characters and karts, each of which combines to give different stats for when you head out on track, much like in Mario Kart 8, the structure of Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, the menagerie of items new and old, and plenty more. There’s new additions like Kamek, who can transform rivals, and, yup, you’ll still get the more powerful items when you’re towards the back.</p>

<p>Similar to Mario Kart 8, newer players can use smart steering to help stay on track, or tilt controls (including with a Joy-Con 2 wheel) to make things harder. New features when racing include the Charge Jump – hold the drift button while going straight to jump up – which is great for dodging incoming attacks, hopping up onto grind rails and wall-riding. You can also Rewind, to roll your position back and let you redo a stretch of a race, perhaps to master a particular trick or jump – other drivers are not rewound though, so don’t use this too much or you’ll end up dead last!</p>
<p>Beyond Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, a standalone custom race you have more control over the race you take part in. You can choose to race a particular track three times round in as is standard, or do a point-to-point race style by racing from one track to another. This even lets you create races that you don’t get to experience in the main game modes.</p>
<p>Battle mode has also been confirmed with a showdown where you have five balloon lives, use items to try and knock out other players’ lives, and the last player standing (driving?) wins.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring the open world in Free Roam, you can look out for P switches that will start particular missions while driving around, such as collecting blue coins or heading to checkpoints.</p>
<p>The game supports four player split-screen multiplayer and up to eight players in local wireless play, while up to 24 players is limited to online play. Here you can party up with friends while free roaming – meet up with your crew in the world map and then cruise around together, battle and race.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game at the first Switch 2 hands on event earlier this month, and had a great time checking out the expanded races, the point-to-point Knockout Tour, seeing all the new characters and falling in love with the ability to race as Cow.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/mario-kart-world-preview-can-nintendo-revolutionise-the-karting-world-again/" aria-label="“Mario Kart World Preview – Can Nintendo revolutionise the karting world again?” (Edit)">Mario Kart World Preview – Can Nintendo revolutionise the karting world again?</a></h2>
<p>Chatting about the Knockout Tour, I said, “Knockout Tour is one long cross-country race, with checkpoints to blaze a trail towards and the final four drivers to reach that point being eliminated. From twenty-four racers at the start, it will chop the field down to just four by the time you’re racing for the win. It ramps up the pressure in a very different way, and the sheer number of players, the volume of pickups going off makes for some seriously topsy-turvy moments as you tumble from 5th to 19th and the cusp of getting completely knocked out as you come to the next time gate.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mario-kart-world-gameplay-details-revealed-ahead-of-june-launch.1166742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation in which the Japanese gaming giant showed off more gameplay details for the upcoming racer&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>Set to debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>represents the first entirely new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game since 2014's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and Nintendo has packed in a fair few new features to reflect that. Here's everything covered during today's show!</p>

<hr><h2>New and returning courses in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>First, we got a look at some of the courses that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As you'd expect, there will be a number of new courses on offer, as well as several returning favorites.</p>

<p>New courses include the canyon-set Mario Bros. Circuit, the urban Crown City, and the spooky movie theater Boo Cinema, while returning courses include the likes of Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=Nuyuz6bd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=LcFAosad 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has a number of new courses to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed at the time of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">original announcement</a>, these courses will be integrated into a fully-explorable world, and you'll need to drive between them when you're racing in certain modes.</p>

<h2>New and returning racers in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>Several new characters will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s lineup. They include the likes of the series' iconic Goomba, as well as a cloudless Lakitu, New Donk City mayor Pauline, and more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to certain characters making a return; Mario and Luigi are givens, and Peach, Bowser, and many others will be coming back to race in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose which vehicle you want to use while racing, and each vehicle has different stats, as do the characters themselves. It doesn't look like you'll be choosing individual parts for your vehicles this time around, though.</p>

<h2><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s many gameplay modes</h2>

<p>We also got a look at the gameplay modes that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As has been previously revealed, the two main modes on offer are Grand Prix and Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The former works like a classic&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>Grand Prix mode; you'll race across four courses, and the winner is the racer who accrues the most points, although you will also be driving between courses now.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour, meanwhile, tasks you with placing ahead of other racers to avoid being eliminated. Several different sets of courses will be available for both modes. Of course, classic multiplayer staples like VS Race and Battle Mode will also be available.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s Free Roam mode is exactly what it sounds like; you'll be exploring the game's world, finding hidden switches and panels to take on missions. Nintendo didn't reveal whether the missions will unlock any extra stuff, but they should be a fun way to hone your racing skills.</p>

<h2>New items and gameplay tricks</h2>

<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will introduce a number of new items you can use to get one over on your racing rivals. They include the Mega Mushroom, which lets you grow to a massive size and stomp your enemies, and the Hammer, which you can throw to create obstacles on the course.</p>

<p>These will, of course, accompany returning items like Bullet Bill and the Lightning powerup, although I don't think I spotted the iconic Blue Shell during the Direct. Hopefully, it'll be making some kind of return; a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game with no Blue Shell is no&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=BiE6FsY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=EDY9_yO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new powerups for you to try.</figcaption></figure><p>These items will be accompanied by plenty of new gameplay tricks, including wall-riding, grinding on rails, and Charge Jumping, which lets you hold the Drift button while racing straight to charge up a jump. You can then use that jump to dodge projectiles and other hazards.</p>

<p>We also got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s drive-thru Yoshi's, which will let you collect food items in order to unlock new outfits. You can then select these outfits on the character selection screen.</p>

<p>Several support features will be available, too, including smart steering and auto-acceleration, which you can use to level the playing field if you're experiencing&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>alongside franchise newbies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the Rewind feature, which lets you rewind yourself to a point before making a mistake. It only works on the racer using it, though, so be aware of that if you're using it tactically.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during today's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>Direct show! The game is due to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th.</p>

There’s an outbreak, we cut to years later when only a few survive, then follow a small band of survivors who get stuck on the roof of a mall. I think that’s about 90 percent of them. Which is why the complete weirdness featured in the latest trailer for <em>28 Years Later</em> is so incredibly welcome.</p><p>One of the greatest TV shows ever made was Damon Lindelof’s 2014 series <em>The Leftovers</em>. Where many shows have previously covered the territory of large numbers of people mysteriously vanishing, In <em>The Leftovers</em>, two percent of the Earth’s population inexplicably vanished in a single moment. The program was set two years later, focusing on a small New York community, exploring the repercussions of this event. And it was <em>weird</em>. It was rooted in the unknown, in the lack of an explanation, and the consequences on society, whether it was the formation of deeply peculiar cults, or the personal trauma of losing loved ones. But also, other stuff: dogs were turning feral, deer became less timid, and there was this one waterfall...</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I bring this up because it’s that same vibe of humanity’s spiraling into strangeness that seems most key to this new footage from <em>28 Years Later</em>. Rather than exploring the horror of the immediate zombie apocalypse, here director Danny Boyle seems to be using the three-decades-on approach to envisage a society that’s known little else, and the bizarre, uncomfortable, and spiritual effects this has had on people. Plus, you know, people running away from brain-hungry undeads.</p><p>The movie is out on June 20, so there’s still a fair amount of waiting to do. But this is looking like it could be something very interesting.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>All the latest information on the "biggest Mario Kart ever."</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,859 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250416860422/en/" target="_blank">shared</a> new information for <em><a title="Games > Mario Kart World [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></em> during a dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast today, introducing the “biggest <em>Mario Kart</em> ever” by showcasing its Grand Prix races, Knockout Tours, Battle Mode, Free Roam, and more. <span id="more-959136"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> features a series-first: an interconnected world where you can drive virtually anywhere, including across cities, plains, a desert and even the ocean. Races are held throughout this world’s various regions and feature dynamic weather conditions and a day / night cycle. Start your engines and compete for first place in Grand Prix or the new Knockout Tour mode or simply experience a leisurely drive across a world of diverse locales in Free Roam. The world is your racetrack, and there’s plenty to discover—solo or with friends, locally or online. This is just the starting line!</p><p>Read below for more information about everything featured:</p><ul><li><strong>An Interconnected World</strong> – Drift, draft and drive your way around an interconnected world for the first time in a Mario Kart game. In <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game’s courses are interspersed across the world with roads leading from one to the next – so players can experience navigating roads in between courses!</li><li><strong>Grand Prix</strong> – Bring home the gold in Grand Prix, which consists of four different races to win each Cup – including the Mushroom</li><li><strong>Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, and More</strong> – Held across the game’s world. And for the first time in the series, racers will need to drive from one course to the next as part of the Grand Prix! In Mushroom Cup, for example, you’ll start off <a title="Genres > Racing [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> the Mario Bros. Circuit, then the second race will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City. Conquer every Grand Prix Cup and you might just unlock a certain colorful course!</li><li><strong>Knockout Tour</strong> – Race from one end of the world to the other in these extended rallies, with checkpoints dotted throughout. If you don’t make the cut, you’re out of the running, so buckle up for these non-stop sprints because you’ll need to keep pace to stay in the race. Your rivals aren’t the only hazards you’ll need to avoid on the road, either. Vehicles that shoot Bullet Bills, Hammer Bros. attacks, and other obstacles will find their way into this mode as well. Drive to survive and keep your eyes on first place!</li><li><strong>Free Roam</strong> – There is plenty to discover in <em>Mario Kart World</em> that goes beyond racing. So when you’re not aiming for first place, take the scenic route in Free Roam! Explore panoramic vistas, go (way) off-road, see the seas and find secrets like hidden coins, or hit P Switches to take on hundreds of missions that can help improve your driving skills outside of races. You can also take in-game photos while free roaming, so take a road trip and strike a pose at the sights.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_959205"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Battle Mode</strong> – Battle Mode is back and more hectic than ever! Secure the gold by collecting the most coins in Coin Runners or burst your rivals’ balloons with items in Balloon Battle. If you pop all of your rival’s balloons, they are out!</li><li><strong>New Techniques</strong> – Leap over obstacles and more with the new Charge Jump move. Use it to jump onto rails that you can grind, dodge attacks from your rivals and even jump toward a wall to ride on it for a short time. You can also chain together wall-rides to uncover hidden routes. Miss your mark during Free Roam or single-player mode? Just use Rewind to reset your vehicle to its original position—this is a great way to undo a driving mishap, but keep in mind that your rivals will still move normally while rewinding, so try not to lose your lead!</li><li><strong>24 Racers</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> features races with up to 24 participants from around the world – the most in Mario Kart series history! Modes like Grand Prix and Knockout Tour allow up to 24 players to compete, filling the game world with friends and familiar faces and plenty of rivals to vie for first place.</li><li><strong>Fun With Everyone, Anywhere</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> offers multiple ways to play together, locally or online. Up to four players can race split screen on the same system. The game also supports local wireless play where up to eight players (with up to two players per Nintendo <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [103 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> system) can race together. And players from around the world can join a race or battle in online play. In Free Roam, you can also meet up with your crew anywhere in this game’s world. Drive around, see where your friends are on the map and warp to them instantly. Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.</li><li><strong>Even More Fun with GameChat</strong> – GameChat features an expanded online experience in the <em>Mario Kart World</em> game. Use the Nintendo Switch 2 built-in microphone to voice chat with friends while driving together or take a backseat and watch each other’s game screens. You can enjoy GameChat without needing a Nintendo Switch Online membership until March 31, 2026. After that, a Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required.</li><li><strong>CameraPlay</strong> – If you have a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera (sold separately)***, your face will show up beside your racer, and you can see your friends’ reactions when you play online! When playing locally with family and friends on the same system, a single camera can detect up to four people’s faces that you can see in-game as well.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> – <em>Mario Kart World</em> has many races to enjoy across its vast world. Rule the roads on brand new courses like Mario Bros. Circuit, the modern streets of Crown City, the snowy trails of Starview Peak and the spirited Boo Cinema, just to name a few. Nostalgic courses from previous Mario Kart games have also been reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics.</li><li><strong>Characters</strong> – Get behind the wheel as familiar Mushroom Kingdom characters like Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser. Looking for a racer that’s a little more offbeat? Try taking Goomba, Spike and even Cow for a test drive.</li><li><strong>New Items</strong> – Tear up the track with a selection of new and returning items. Throw a Coin Shell to knock rivals off course and make coins appear that gradually increase the speed of whoever collects them. Chill out the competition (and send ’em spinning) with the Ice Flower. Bring down the Hammer to nail your rival or briefly block their path. Use a Mega Mushroom to grow big and squash your rivals. Leap to new heights with the Feather. Call in Kamek’s magic to transform your rivals into something surprising and cause unexpected chaos on the course. The lower your position, the more likely you’ll receive items that could turn the tables, so when you get something good … go for it!</li><li><strong>Drive-Thru and Roll-Out</strong> – Make a pit stop at Yoshi’s for a local delight – Dash Food! These to-go orders will give you a speed boost and sometimes also unlock outfits that can be donned from the character selection screen. There are plenty of dishes and outfits to find, so drive through when making your way around <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</li><li><strong>Even More Modes</strong> – Whether you want to race or battle, there are even more ways to stoke some friendly competition in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Race against the clock in Time Trials, where players can also go online to compete against ghost data from racers around the world. And you can customize the rules of the road in VS Race, where drivers can decide if they want to compete with two, three or four teams with a classic three-lap ruleset or by driving from one course to another.</li><li><strong>Roadside Assistance</strong> – Looking for some options to assist you on race day? Features like Smart Steering to keep you on course, Auto-Accelerate and Tilt Controls for motion control steering are available to turn on or off whenever you like. Plus, if you have the Joy-Con 2 Wheel accessory (available as a set of two, sold separately) you can feel like you’re really driving!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is due out for Switch 2 on June 5 alongside Switch 2.</p><p>Watch the <em>Mario Kart World</em> Direct archive below.

                <p>Nintendo teased that Rainbow Road will return in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>, although it'll be unlocked in a surprising way.</p><p>The tease game partway through Mario Kart World's Nintendo Direct, as Nintendo provided an overview of all the different courses the game has to offer and its Grand Prix mode. Toward the end of this segment, the narrator teased that "if you conquer all Grand Prix cups, rumor has it that a certain colorful course will appear." As they say that, we see an object leaving behind a rainbow-colored streak flying into the air.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Nintendo did not directly say the course's name, it's clear that Rainbow Road is what it's referring to. Rainbow Road stands as the most iconic Mario Kart course. First appearing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-17690">Super Mario Kart</a>, it has since been reimagined for every Mario Kart game since and has a reputation for always being one of the tougher courses in the game. Typically, Rainbow Road has just been part of a four-course cup, but this time around, it looks like Rainbow Road will be the grand reward for acing Mario Kart World's Grand Prix mode.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5. It will be part of a $500 bundle with the console or available separately for $80. Keep an eye on GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2 preorder guide</a> so you can snag a console as soon as preorders go live in North America.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has essentially confirmed in all but name that Rainbow Road will indeed be part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the game's release this summer.</p>
<p>However, while Rainbow Road is a part of the upcoming Mario Kart title, it isn't going to be available to zip around from the off. Rather, players will need to "conquer" all Grand Prix cups. Then, so says Nintendo, "rumour has it a certain colourful course will appear".</p>
<p>So, yep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">that'll be Rainbow Road</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-mario-kart-world-direct-live-watch-here">Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct this afternoon</a> showing a colourful beam leading up to the sky above.</p>

</figure>
<p>Other courses confirmed for Mario Kart World include the all new icy Starview Peak and the spoooooky Boo Cinema, as well as returning series entries like Toad's Factory, Peach Beach and Wario's Galleon.</p>
<p>On the characters side of things, we will of course be able to play as Mario - this is his series after all - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">new racers like Cow</a>, Spike and Goomba (Ed and I want to know how he drives without arms. And, while we are on it, I still have questions about King Boo's driving abilities).</p>
<p>These drivers will be able to use new items, such as Kamek. Yes, Kamek is an item, and his magic will "transform" your racing rivals into, at least as far as today's Direct has shown us, Chargin' Chucks - those large burly Koopas in football gear. "What other mysterious effects will happen," Nintendo teased in today's showcase. I don't know Nintendo, I don't know!</p>
<p>Next up, we have Mario Kart World's support features, handy for those new to the series or for those who, like my god children, are too small to actually be able to control what's going on but still want to be part of the fun.</p>
<p>These features include Smart Steering (often needed when small humans are involved), Auto-Accelerate and Auto-Use Item. There are also Tilt Controls, which are compatible with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s Joy-Con wheel.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mario Kart World will also have new tricks. There's Charge Jump, which can be used while holding the drift button while driving straight ahead. These jumps can enable racers to jump over obstacles such as an oncoming vehicle, "grind along powerlines", and move out of the way of an oncoming rival attack such as a green shell. This jump will also allow the jumper to wall ride for a bit should they jump towards a wall (obviously).</p>
<p>Another new trick arriving with Mario Kart World is Rewind, which does exactly as it says on the tin. Racers can rewind the action, but - and this is important - only for them. Other racers will still be charging ahead as normal.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p>

			<p>Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds launched a rather stomach-churning 12 years ago, a game which I’m sure many have fond memories of, playing with friends, enjoying its silly enemies and simple action. I’m sorry to say that, given the wealth of newer beat ’em ups released since then, it’s not held up all that well. But what’s this? A remaster? Can spruced up graphics and some gameplay tweaks save the day?</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKWLg6wW6k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is now the version of the day, a remaster of the original game with added characters and moved into Unreal Engine 5, so things are shinier, and you’ve got more options in the co-op and versus mode. I do like that the online co-op lets you play with up to six players, which can potentially lead to pure chaos on screen.</p>


<p>The versus mode feels a bit tacked on in games like this, and that’s especially true here as the combat mechanics just aren’t deep enough to make you want to keep hopping in and testing yourself against your friends. To say that most of the combat here is button-mashing would be vastly underselling the amount of button-mashing you can do in Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate.</p>


<p>Technically, you’ve got light, medium, heavy, and special attacks, along with a few movement options and some ultimates as well. In most levels though, you’ll be just hammering one of those wondering when things are about to end. Despite this, there’s fun to be had here because of the incredibly odd enemy design and the generally good feeling of levelling up, but it’s short-lived. If you’re playing alone, you’re most likely going to lose interest pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It’s all just a bit flat, and the story, despite being completely unhinged and involving dimensional travel, isn’t especially inspiring either. It’s all slightly better-looking and it runs smoother than it used to, but unless you’re an absolutely rabid die-hard fan of the original game, that’s really not enough to pit it against more modern takes on the beat ’em up genre like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a>.</p>

<p>I really wanted to enjoy this game more than I did. Reviewing a game you’re excited about but then don’t get on with is, frankly, rubbish. All that excitement just sort of ends up disappearing into the void, and instead of getting a nice pay-off, you get a bit of sadness. It’s not great, you know? Despite my best efforts though, I just couldn’t enjoy this game.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate is a renewed take on a beat 'em up that probably felt a little outdated back when it launched in 2012, and while the revamped graphics and the engine are both nice, they're not enough to make this feel like a game that's really worth sinking your time into. It's a fun five minutes or so here and there, but it's just not doing enough to really make it an enjoyable time.	</p></div>

			<p>NVIDIA announced that its cloud streaming platform GeForce NOW was updated with 11 PC games this week. The highlights are undoubtedly Hunt: Showdown 1896 and Forever Skies.</p>
<p>The former is Crytek's popular horror-themed extraction shooter. Originally released in 2019, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-launched</a> in August 2024 with several updates to the CryEngine version. The game now supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available via GeForce NOW if you have a premium subscription, DirectX 12, HDR displays, multi-bounce global illumination, and more.

Development of a new Crysis game was put on hold, but Hunt: Showdown 1896 continues to be regularly updated due to its healthy player base.

Update 1.0 added the final chapter of the game's story, new points of interest and biomes to explore, new colossal creatures, new collections (artifacts and murals) and cosmetic rewards, new tools, resources, and crafting recipes, various quality of live improvements, and improved performance including NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (available on GeForce NOW for Ultimate tier subscribers).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-royal-writ-is-a-permadeath-deckbuilder-from-yogscast-games.1166691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yogscast Games and developer Save Sloth Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>, a lane-based deckbuilder with an extra sting in its tail for those who like their difficulty a little higher.</p>

<p>The game sees you marching your troops across a series of procedurally-generated maps in order to defeat the final boss and emerge from your run victorious. So far, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow">so deckbuilder</a>, but there's a twist to this one.</p>

<p>If your cards arrive at their destination and the enemy base still has health remaining, then those cards will be permanently deleted from your deck for that run, so you'll have to make clever decisions about which cards to send and which ones to reserve.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=03QgPM-N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=KaiRZV30 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>has an extra sting in its tail thanks to card permadeath.</figcaption></figure><p>Save Sloth and Yogscast say the permadeath mechanic in&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is all part of the point; the system is designed to create "the ultimate jeopardy", leading to "emergent sub-stories" and "memorable" individual runs.</p>

<p>The studios say the point is either to "achieve victory through strategic planning or game-breaking synergies", or to "fail miserably because your soldier got stuck in a bog and you forgot he can't fly". We've all been there.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in "cute picture-book visuals" that emphasize the "grotesque and absurd humor of a medieval world engulfed in constant war and deceit".</p>

<p>Development on&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>began as part of game jam competition Ludum Dare 55, and following "hugely positive feedback", the game moved into full development. You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>'s debut trailer here.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but if you'd like to give the game a go, a playable demo will be available "soon", according to Yogscast and Save Sloth.</p>

<p><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is set for release in 2025 for PC via Steam. There's no word on console ports for the game yet.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-revenue-dips-in-2024-lost-records-sales-in-line-with-forecasts.1166664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial statement for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking a little gloomy for the French studio.</p>

<p>The statement shows that revenues are down significantly; operating revenues fell by 25% to&nbsp;€23.9 million, as compared to 2023's&nbsp;€32.1 million figure. CEO Oskar Guilbert says this year's performance reflects games that "fell short of our expectations" despite "a very positive critical reception".</p>

<p>Despite the revenue drop, Don't Nod says sales were up 14% on last year, largely driven by the studio's back catalog, as well as 2023's&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and early 2024's&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">both games underperformed by the studio's standards</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Xx9xNHlH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Z8Arhvcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's revenues were down in 2024, but sales were up.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Don't Nod, future sales for&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>are "not expected to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full development costs", which essentially means both games have made a loss.</p>

<p>Additionally, the "temporary suspension" of the as-yet unannounced projects P12 and P13, as well as the full cancellation of projects P10 and P14 (these are all internal codenames, of course), led to further losses for Don't Nod.</p>

<p>With all of this said, you might be wondering how the studio's most recent release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, is performing. Don't Nod doesn't provide sales figures for the game, but it does say sales are "in line with forecasts in an increasingly selective market".</p>

<p>The studio also points to the "critical acclaim" for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>, which is reflected by the game's Metacritic average and Steam review score.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is preventing some users from accessing sensitive content unless they allow the platform to verify their age by scanning their face or ID. The new age verification process is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group#h_01JQ4N4R4K238K45JTARQVK2CN">described as an “experiment” by Discord</a>, and is being trialed in the United Kingdom and Australia in response to local laws that require online platforms to have guardrails in place for safeguarding children.</p><p>The new face and ID scanning requirements only apply to Discord users who haven’t previously verified their age on the platform. Discord says this is a “one-time process” that will be triggered in two situations: when users are exposed to nude or sexually explicit content that’s been flagged by Discord’s sensitive media filter, or when users attempt to change filter control settings to prevent such content from being blurred or blocked. </p><p>An age verification window will then appear that prompts the user to either allow Discord to access their device camera and scan their face, or submit a photograph of their ID by scanning a QR code via their phone.</p><p>Discord is likely trialing this process to appease new laws in the UK and Australia that aim to restrict children from accessing sensitive material online. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23922397/uk-online-safety-bill-law-passed-royal-assent-moderation-regulation">UK’s Online Safety Act</a> requires online platforms that may host pornographic content to introduce “robust” age-checking techniques, while <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o">Australia is requiring that under-16s</a> be prevented from accessing social media platforms entirely. We have asked Discord if it has any plans to roll out its experimental age verification process in other regions.</p><p>Discord is placing a surprising amount of trust in the accuracy of the face scanning tool, given some users may be banned if the process decides they look too young to be using the platform. Discord says that users who are verified incorrectly can retry the process or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731">request a manual review</a>, and that users who have been erroneously banned can appeal the decision.</p><p>Discord says the information submitted during this age verification experiment won’t be stored by the company or any of its vendors, regardless of what verification method you choose. “For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face,” says Discord. “For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be about to get some new playable characters on PC, judging from a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@d3dnier398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3DNieR</a>, shows the Turks Reno and Rude controlled by the player, complete with all of their abilities in their boss battles. Although it's clear that there's still more work to be done for a proper implementation, as Reno's voice doesn't work and every unique ability of the two characters doesn't require any ATB, both characters work remarkably well already, which is quite impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Playable Reno &amp; Rude Test | [REBIRTH]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH2S9LnksUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release on PC earlier this year, plenty of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth have been released online, introducing improvements and new features not available in the vanilla game, such as the ability to increase the party size limit past three members and a<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/">dd temporary characters like Zack and Sephiroth to the party</a>, making them playable outside the small segments they are supposed to in the vanilla game. This party mod also allows players to add Cid and Vincent to the party, although the two characters aren't playable as they have no moveset, an issue that crashes the game whenever they are added to the frontline party.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has yet to be officially announced, but the work of a dedicated user is providing a better look at the unannounced remaster today.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesIV4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JamesIV4</a> restored some of the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oblivion-remastered-dark-screenshots-restored-KscfaBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots</a> that leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a>, which were considerably darker than others as they were likely intended as a backdrop for things like store pages or banners, as the user pointed out. Every location shown in the screenshots looks gorgeous in the restored images, but the night skybox in the Dock at night screenshot looks particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Following months of rumors and speculation, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was proven to be real earlier this week, when the aforementioned screenshots leaked online via the Virtuos official website. While there was no need for another confirmation that the game is real, mentions of the remaster have recently been discovered on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Bethesda website</a>, so all that is truly left is an official announcement and launch, which should happen sometime next week, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">multiple insiders.</a></p>
<p>2025 is going to be a remarkable year for fans of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, as fans will likely be able to experience a recreation of the game in Skyrim with the Skyblivion project, regardless of the launch of Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Yesterday</a>, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize commented on how the official remaster will not impact the passion-fueled project as long as Bethesda allows it to exist.</p>

It includes four colored records, a slipcase that looks like it’s been through some stuff, and two beautiful lithographs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gustavo Santaolalla’s soundtrack is about as iconic as game music gets.

I picked it up for Gato Roboto, which is exactly what it sounds like: a cat in a mech suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is ideal for anyone who wants games that actually let you explore and experiment. The titles are highly rated, weird in the best way, and don’t take up 80 gigs of storage. It’s refreshing.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218891"><div id="218891" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Alright, I’ll be honest.

Lillie’s Clefairy ex is still floating around $180 and N’s Zoroark ex has dropped to $13, which tells me the hype has deflated and we’re in “buy because it’s fun” territory again.

It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products. It’s a smart LED floor lamp with AI-generated lighting modes, music sync, voice control, app scheduling, and a vibe for every mood. It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes. I think it’s great if you want one light to do everything without fiddling with settings for half an hour.</p></div><p id="lepro-b2-ai-smart-light-bulbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs">Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218706"><div id="218706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the same AI bulbs as the ones in the floor lamp, but in classic 75W-equivalent LED form.

The music sync is fun, the AI scenes work well, and the voice commands actually feel smart instead of gimmicky. I bought a set of these last month and haven’t touched the wall switch since. At $8 per bulb, it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>League of Legends' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">first ever themed season</a>, Welcome to Noxus, is about to wrap up and Riot has announced Season 2: Spirit Blossom Beyond. The next season will bring changes to the Summoner's Rift map and general gameplay, a new champion, new Spirit Blossom skins, and a brand-new game mode titled Brawl.</p><p>Spirit Blossom is already a popular skin line and recurring theme in LoL, based around Ionian myths and folklore tied to the region's Spirit Blossom festivals. Riot announced the seasonal theme with a new cinematic titled Here, Tomorrow--an anime-style animation created in partnership with The Line--set to an original track by singer-songwriter Lilas Ikuta and composer Kevin Penkin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4l0KBAn6LU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T4l0KBAn6LU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The music video crosses between the "real" world of Ionia and its spirit-world counterpart, featuring a number of popular champions including Ashe, Nidalee, Lux, Shen, Irelia, and Morgana. The video focuses on Xin Zhao, who is shown returning to Ionia, and seems to reveal the season's new champion, Yunara. Xin Zhao's story will be explored throughout the season with the first of two motion comics arriving on May 14, and Riot has also said to expect an in-client metagame based on the season's story.</p><p>Once Season 2 launches on April 30, Spirit Blossom Beyond will take over Summoner's Rift with not just aesthetic changes, but also gameplay changes that will have an impact on the game's meta. In the new season, Atakhan will only have a single form called Thornbound Atakhan, rather than swapping between two forms. Void Grubs will now spawn later and only once per match, while the Rift Herald will now spawn at 15 minutes and will be easier to take down.</p><p>From the start of Season 2, only junglers will have access to the Smite summoner spell, which will be automatically assigned to players in that role. A number of other tweaks and tuning changes are coming in with the new season, which the devs have detailed in a recent <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-season-2-gameplay-changes-preview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev blog</a>.</p><p>The new season will also include a new 5v5 game mode called Brawl, which Riot describes as a "faster-paced, lower-stakes game mode" that puts the emphasis on combat. Brawl will feature a brand-new map based on Bandle City, and with no towers or other objectives to focus on, players will have to go head-to-head with each other to push their minions into the enemy base.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Spirit Blossom-themed season will also include a new handful of Spirit Blossom skins, a popular skin line that already features over 20 different champions. The champions in line for Spirit Blossom skins this time include Ashe, Irelia, Bard, Varus, Zyra, and Ivern. Prestige Spirit Blossom Lux and Spirit Blossom Ivern will be available to be earned on the paid battle pass. Riot has also revealed that Morgana has an Exalted skin on the way.</p><p>Spirit Blossom Beyond launches on April 30, taking the spotlight from the current Noxian-themed season. However the LoL universe will be returning to Noxus sooner or later, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-cinematic-from-arcane-studio-continues-shows-story/1100-6528678/" data-ref-id="1100-6528678">next Arcane spin-off show</a> likely to revolve around that region. Arcane co-creator Christian Linke also said that the show would be exploring Ionia and Demacia with future series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-zelda-games-wont-support-cloud-saves-to-backup-your-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> Editions of both Zelda games won't support cloud saves for data backup, and it's currently unclear why.</p>
<p>On the store pages for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> on Switch 2, a disclaimer reads: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p>
<p>This same disclaimer is not present for other Switch 2 Edition games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> - so it's unclear why this is only impacting Zelda games.</p>

<p>What's more, this disclaimer is only on the US and EU store pages. The <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096248">Japanese page</a> still states the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership is required for the use of the save data storage service (machine translation).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? As a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/">ResetEra</a> noted, players can import their save file from the original Switch to continue using the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but then won't be able to create a new cloud save file as they continue.</p>
<p>What's more, it seems even if players start a fresh save using the Switch 2 Edition, they still won't be able to backup their save file.</p>
<p>But why exactly would this only be the case for Zelda and not other games? For now, the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games do bring plenty of upgrades. The Zelda games, for instance, have improved visual performance as well as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">updated app with achievements</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-zelda-ports-let-players-repair-equipment-using-accompanying-app">new method to repair equipment</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">complete updated editions for the new console will cost £65</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-games-will-be-complete-on-the-card-without-a-download-nintendo-confirms">all data included on the game card</a> - something Nintendo clarified following confusion.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Breath of the Wild won't include the original game's DLC on Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda is yet to officially announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but we all know it's real. Along with those  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project have also been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a>. It is safe to say with this remake it's just a case of when, not if.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the team working Skyblivion, the volunteer-based project by TESRenewal seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine? Has news of an official remake caused the bounce to go from their collective bungee? (To paraphrase Wallace and Gromit, there.)</p>

<figcaption>Our Jim has thoughts on the Oblivion remake, or rather, the lack of a Morrowind remake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH0bzE6hGhE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, no, this is not the case at all. <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140">Writing on social media</a>, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the team working on Skyblivion are concerned.</p>
<p>Rebelzize said the "real remake is the friends we made along the way", before stating the Skyblivion mod was and remains "a passion project".</p>
<p>In fact, Rebelzize sees it as a "win-win" for the Oblivion community which will get "twice the amount of Oblivion this year".</p>

<p>"All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster," Rebelzize wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912505305163792886">subsequent post</a>, Rebelzize added: "Since this got a lot more attention [than] I expected, let me just say I hope you will enjoy either the official or our remake. Either way thanks for the support and be kind to one another."</p>
<p>Team Folon - the group behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">ambitious Fallout London mod for Fallout 4</a> - shared Rebelzize's post, writing: "We stand by you. All our love Skyblivion team."</p>

<p>As mentioned, Skyblivion is a voluntary project that fans of The Elder Scrolls games have been working on quite some time. The Skyblivion team has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-video-of-skyblivion-which-is-oblivion-in-skyrim">steadily documenting its progress for over a decade now</a>, and I think I just felt myself age as rapidly as that chap in The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion blog post</a> shared a roadmap for the mod's release, affirming it will "close shut the jaws of Oblivion in 2025".</p>

<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p>
<p>Think he's on to something?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/16/space-marine-2-update-lets-you-make-a-trygon-become-a-bygone-heres-the-patch-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is here, and it brings another big batch of free content, including a new PvE Operation and a new Tyranid boss, the Trygon which lends the update its name. There’s also plenty of new PvP content, season pass additions and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Trygon Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oAHVCnAXxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new PvE Operation, Extraction, tasks you with reaching the Adeptus Mechanicus facility on Avarax, figuring out where the Tech-Priest is that is refusing to extract, and try to get them out of there, if they’ve survived so far. Along the ay you’ll face off against the Trygon, a huge burrowing Tyranid that creates underground passageways for other Tyranid to us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you can now earn Prestige Ranks in PvE – visit the Armouring Hall once you’ve reached level 25 and activate prestiging from the Skill Tree screen – there’s private PvP lobbies, a new Inferno Pistol secondary, new customisation options, and updates to the weapons, weapon perks, matchmaking and a bunch of other bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>For Season Pass holders, there’s the new Space Wolves Chapter Pack and Imperial Fists Champion Pack to let you customise your look in even more ways.</p>

<p>See all of those in the full patch notes:</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p><b>New Operation — Exfiltration</b></p>
<p><i>Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that&nbsp; creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms.</i></p>
<p><b>Private Lobbies in PvP</b></p>
<p><i>A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes.</i></p>
<p><b>Prestige Ranks in PvE</b></p>
<p><i>The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class’ progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. <b>Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock.</i></p>
<p><b>PvE Extended List of Available Weapons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heavy</b>: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Tactical</b>: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Assault</b>: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol</li>
<li><b>Bulwark</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Sniper</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine</li>
<li><b>Vanguard</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game.</i></p>
<p><i>Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This isn’t the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement.</i></p>
<p><strong>New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol</strong></p>
<p><em>Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode</strong></p>
<p><i>This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go.</i></p>
<p><b>Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode</b></p>
<p><i>This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up.</i></p>
<p><b>Public Test Server (PTS)</b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward.</i></p>
<p><i>The PTS will be closed for now, but we’ll reopen it once we’ll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.</i></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>New Season Pass Content</b></h3>
<p><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Champion (Vanguard).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Weapon Skins (Bolt Carbine, Thunder Hammer, Chainsword).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Customisation (Helmet, Chest, Pauldron, Greave, Heraldry markings).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Imperial Fists Champion Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Imperial Fists Champion (Tactical).</li>
<li>Imperial Fists Signature Weapon Skin (Plasma Incinerator).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customisation</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Colours:</b> New default colours Volupus Pink and Thousand Sons Blue.</li>
<li><b>Bulwark Cloth Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the cloth for Bulwark tabard has been added as an option for the chest armour piece for customisation.</li>
<li><b>Hands Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the gauntlet armour piece is added. Now the primary colour is used to colour a fist and the secondary one colours a wrist and a shoulder part of the hand. <i>(This one is for you, Iron Hands and Crimson Fists fans!)</i></li>
<li>Lots of minor fixes for customisation of armour parts and emblems.​</li>
</ul>
<h2>​Gameplay &amp; Balancing tweaks</h2>

</ul>
<p>Base XP for all difficulties in Operation Mode is increased by 10%.</p>
<h3>PvE Weapon Perks Update</h3>
<p><i>With this update we are rolling out a massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks. As a result all weapons received buffs one way or another.</i></p>
<p><i>Some notes regarding our future plans in terms of balancing: I want to say that I’m not a big fan of changing too many things at the same time. It is hard to predict the outcome, it’s a risk of introducing bugs and not every change is a simple number change. Past 2 patches changelogs were several pages long. I’m more in favor of gradual improvements of the game rather than chaotic changes back and forth. This means that we do see your feedback on some of the class perks and weapons etc, even looking at the current weapon perks rework I feel like we could have done a better job with plasma weapons and power sword perks.</i></p>
<p><i>There will be a second pass on class, weapon and prestige perks. Probably around Patch 8. I do think that those systems are in much much better shape than they were before patches and on release, the scope of the second pass will be smaller.</i></p>

<h3>Class Perks Update</h3>
<p><b>Tactical</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiating Impact</b>: Fixed incorrect bonus stack with Auspex Scan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sniper</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fixed incorrect stacking values of Sniper’s <b>Renewal</b> and <b>Squad Renewal</b> perks.&nbsp;</i><i>This resulted in following changes:</i></li>
<li><b>Squad Renewal</b>: Fixed incorrect ability charge restoring (15% instead of planned 10%).</li>
<li><b>Renewal</b>: Fixed typo in the description (5% ability charge restored instead of actual 15%).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Heavy</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced Force</b>: Fixed bonus to melee hold attacks that was mistakenly working in addition to bonus to all melee attacks.</li>
<li>General Balancing</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Assault (PvE only)</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jump Pack Ability</b>: recharge speed increased by 10%.</li>
<li><b>Contested Heals Restoring by Ground Pound was changed</b>: Ground Pound restores 30% of max contested health, regardless of the type of enemy and their number. When hitting with Ground Pound, 30% of max contested health is restored.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is a major buff to Assault survivability, because previously its contested health restore depended on too many factors. Now it is significantly increased and will be consistent.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a maximum cap to restore fade HP per action; and a max target to restore health per action to the following weapons:a</li>
<li>Multi-Melta</li>
<li>Melta Rifle</li>
<li>Heavy&nbsp;Plasma Incinerator</li>
<li>Plasma Incinerator</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This change may sound drastic on paper, but in reality the limit isn’t that strict. It only prevents situations where a single shot from Melta could restore the entire health bar when hitting only 3-4 enemies at the same time. Plus, the contested health restore will be more consistent now.</i></p>
<p>Firearms (PvE only)</p>
<p><i>We are continuing to polish up weapon balance and I think we are in a good spot right now where all weapons are viable on Absolute difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>Sure, some of them are still worse than others and we will continue to tweak them. Our next big objective is to take a closer look at weapon versions balance within the same archetype. Especially melee weapons.</i></p>
<p><b>Occulus Bolt Carbine&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>Master-Crafted – Alpha</i></b> (Accuracy) version of the Occulus Bolt Carbine has -15% spread now instead of the +15% spread.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Multi-Melta</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the bug where the rate-of-fire versions of the Multi-Melta did not have an increased rate of fire. Now, the Master-Crafted version has a 15% increase in RoF, the Artificer version has a 25% increase, and the Relic version has a 35% increase.</li>
