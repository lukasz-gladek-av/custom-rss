			<p>I’m going to be honest here, I adore the Digimon games. Both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/19/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review/">Cyber Sleuth</a> and Hacker’s Memory were excellent games that let you push on with the story when you wanted to, or just choose to ignore it to make the most absurdly powerful Digimon your patience could manage. These aren’t world-changing games, they’re just a lot of fun, and the Digimon system of going up and down the evolutionary ladder to max out your stats and unlock new forms is one of the purest dopamine-delivery systems outside of Vampire Survivors. We’ve had to wait the better part of a decade for a sequel to those two games, but Digimon Story Time Stranger looks to continue that legacy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Digimon Story Time Stranger | Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPBLhpfaklc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It shouldn’t be a huge surprise that I’m besotted with Digimon Story Time Stranger. Not only does it bring back the core systems from the previous Digimon Story titles, but it also irons out some of the needless creases, and then wraps a completely absurd plot around it. Seriously, the story in this game involves time paradoxes, parallel worlds, and chosen ones. Not to mention that you seem to be playing as an in-universe anime character, it’s wild. The story doesn’t always hit, but it’s cosy in an old-school RPG sort of way.</p>


<p>In a time where the other creature collector behemoth is trying to shift across to real time battling,&nbsp;Time Stranger continues with the tried and true turn-based combat of previous games, but this time you can activate agent skills to power up your team or deal damage to your foes. You can also equip your Digimon with different skills you can swap around to make sure every Digimon has a range of options to use. Digimon have elemental types, but they also have categories, and those both interact to determine strengths and weaknesses, so you really want a wide mix of options on your side.</p>


<p>As you fight, you level up and also get more information on enemies. You can eventually convert the scanned info from enemies into actual Digimon, and you can then use them and level them up, send them to the farm to train them there, keep them on your reserve team, or keep them in your bank, where they’ll still get experience points as you fight too. Of course, you can also feed them to other Digimon to make them stronger too, which is a nice way to use the excess you’ll end up with, so long as you don’t think about it too much.</p>
<p>You can then digivolve your critters once they’ve got the right stats, and once your Agent Rank is high enough – this essentially just goes up as you do more quests. To reach that tipping point, your creatures get passive boosts from fighting, of course, but also from the act of digivolving and de-digivolving back to previous forms. It means your monsters are constantly going up and down the evolutionary tree and exploring new branches in a way that’d make Darwin vomit… which is nice? You can now handle this from the menus whenever and wherever you are, instead of always having to return to the hub. This makes it all feel a lot smoother, and with all the gains you get elsewhere, you can basically ignore the Digimon Farm completely if you want to.</p>

<p>To take a brief break from all the compliments, there is some weird monetisation built into Digimon Story Time Stranger. Beyond what is promised for the DLC season pass, there are special dungeons you can go into that apparently give loads of experience, gold, and materials, but you have to buy them separately and they weren’t available before launch for us to dig into. I don’t love it, and the only saving grace is that you really don’t need these dungeons to make good progress.</p>
<p>Visually, the game’s gorgeous. It’s got a lovely anime style to it, and the variety of environments you visit is incredible. You’ll see all sorts of biomes and get to talk to a preposterous number of Digimon as well. It sounds amazing too, as the soundtrack changes with each area and really helps set the tone. It’s not bouncing light beams all over the place, but I really like it.</p>

<p>Along with all of that, the ability to speed up fights and even automate them allows you to treat this more like a management game if you want to. It certainly helps you to race through some of the grind, in a way that has often been retrofit into JRPG remasters. As a distraction, there’s&nbsp; even a card game in it you can muck about with, though it’s not especially deep and probably won’t keep you distracted from the main focus of raising and battling Digimon. Let’s be honest, that’s the main reason you’re here, isn’t it?</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really, really like Digimon Story Time Stranger. While it's hardly upending the monster collection and battling genre, it's a really comfortable and enjoyable game that feels&nbsp;reminiscent of watching Saturday morning cartoons as a kid. It's an awful lot of fun, and is right up there as one of my favourite games of the year.	</p></div>

<p>Gee Bee lands tomorrow</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The next <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> title coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 buzzes onto the consoles tomorrow, <strong>2nd October 2025</strong>, and it's the first-title Toru Iwatani — the creator of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> — developed for Namco.</p>
<p>The 1978 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gee_bee">Gee Bee</a> is the next game in Hamster's huge catalogue of ports. Notably, Gee Bee was the first ever arcade game designed in-house at Namco. The game will be <strong>$7.99</strong> on Switch 1,and <strong>$9.99</strong> on Switch 2 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>On both consoles, the game will support mouse controls — on Switch 1, that means plugging in a USB mouse, while Mouse Mode on Switch 2 will work straight away.</p>
<p>This is essentially a block breaker game, though with a little bit of a pinball table twist. You'll use a rotary dial to control paddles to hit balls towards the top of the screen.</p>
<p>While Gee Bee was a success, it underperformed in Namco's eyes. Still, without it, the arcade scene and Namco's own output may have been very different, so it's an important part of history.</p>

<p>Arcade Archives Gee Bee and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-gee-bee">Arcade Archives 2 Gee Bee</a> arrive on the eShop tomorrow. Will you be checking these out? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-to-house-far-cry-rainbow-six-and-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-as-vantage-studios.1313626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been over six months since Ubisoft and Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">first announced that a new subsidiary to house Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed</a>, Ubisoft's biggest franchises, would be formed and partially owned by Tencent, with the Chinese publisher getting a 25% minority stake for investing 1.16 billion euros. Now, we know what this new subsidiary will be called: Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>As we learned this past July, the studio will be run by the son of Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">Charlie Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes as co-CEOs</a>, with Vantage Studios set to focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">narrative-driven experiences, scaling Ubisoft's mobile division, and enhancing its live service offerings and multiplayer experiences.</a> </p>



<p>Ubisoft unveiled the new studio name <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-brandnew-subsidiary-vantage-studios">in a blog post on its website today</a>, where it referred to the new subsidiary as the "'<em>creative house' now responsible for some of Ubisoft's largest franchises</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Vantage Studios will take on development and expansion of these brands, building on the foundation of Ubisoft's experience and expertise, sharing services and technical resources, all while giving developers more hands-on control over the games they are building</em>."</p>



<p>The most intriguing section of the statement, however, is the fact that Vantage Studios is not a one-off experiment with Tencent. More "<em>creative houses</em>" will be formed to house other major brands and franchises that Ubisoft owns.</p>



<p>What shape these new subsidiaries take, and who their major investors will be, cannot be currently known. But this makes it sound like Ubisoft's future will be one where the Guillemot family gets to keep control and keep the Ubisoft name above everything, while various teams across its global footprint will stop necessarily bearing the Ubisoft name outright. </p>



<p>For example, we could see future Assassin's Creed titles where the developer is listed as 'Vantage Studios,' with the subtitle 'A Ubisoft Studio.' Or the subtitle could be dropped entirely, and we'll start to recognize Vantage Studios in the same way we all recognize that teams like Raven Software and Treyarch are Activision teams working on Call of Duty.</p>



<p>"<em>Vantage Studios represents a first step in Ubisoft's ongoing transformation, with plans to set up additional creative houses and group its brands and franchises under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise. The goal of Vantage Studios, and future creative houses, is to facilitate stronger and deeper connections between developers and players. This streamlined approach allows for both a higher level of autonomy for developers and a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback, while still offering the benefit of Ubisoft's expertise, services, tools, and tech</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Comprising teams developing the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises based in Ubisoft's studios in Montréal</em>, <em>Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, Vantage Studios brings together thousands of experienced developers from across the world, many of whom are responsible for creating some of Ubisoft's biggest games</em>."</p>



<p>It's clear that after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">less-than-desirable year in 2024,</a> one of the videogame industry's oldest and largest global developers and publishers will look very different in the next few years. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-q-a-%E2%80%93-bringing-the-ghoul-from-the-tv-show-to-the-game.1313623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has unveiled Fallout 76: Burning Springs, the largest update to the online action RPG since 2020, and the headline feature is indeed the addition of Cooper Howard, also known as The Ghoul, straight from Amazon's TV show.</p>



<p>The Ghoul is, as you would expect, voiced by actor Walton Goggins, and he serves as a sort of quest-giver. He is connected to the biggest feature of the Burning Springs update, Bounty Hunting missions. These can be found all throughout the new region (which brings Fallout 76 players, and indeed the whole franchise, to Ohio for the first time). New bounties will always be available, and the larger ones are effectively server-wide events that any player can join once they are triggered.</p>



<p>Burning Springs itself is a slice of arid, post-nuclear Ohio, not unlike the desert of Nevada - again, seemingly in another nod to the Fallout show's upcoming second season. This new area features new factions, challenges, unique weapons (including The Ghoul's own gun) and gear, and new fish to catch. Fallout 76 players can look forward to meeting new characters, such as the Rust King — an intelligent Super Mutant with whom players must collaborate across Burning Springs — as well as exploring new locations, public events, workshops, and finding a wild local menace called the Rad Hog. Those brave enough to tame it can make it a C.A.M.P. pet. Burning Springs is also home to Deathclaws and various Raiders.</p>



<div><p>The update will go live in December, presumably right on time with the show's second season, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starts airing on December 17 on Amazon Prime Video</a>. Following the remote presentation, Fallout 76 Production Director Bill Lacoste and Creative Director Jon Rush answered several questions fielded by various outlets in a roundtable format. You can find the whole transcript below.</p><p><strong>Why Ohio?</strong></p></div>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> That's a great question, and I usually don't answer a question with a question, but why not Ohio? As to why Ohio, we wanted to expand the map again. We like to create updates that allow us to tell the next chapter in our story of Appalachia, but also give our players the opportunity to continue telling more of your own stories, both in the places you've adventured and then the things that you've built.</p>



<p>So, when we decided to do another regional expansion, which kind of satisfies all those criteria, we were looking at the map and we looked towards the east and we started to skirt towards the Capital Wasteland stuff. We were looking towards the West and realized, oh, we're right up against Ohio. Not much has been done in that region with Fallout lore. So, why not, you know? We decided to rebuild the Point Pleasant Bridge and let folks cross over into Ohio and discover what's happened to it post-war.</p>

We decided to rebuild the Point Pleasant Bridge and let folks cross over into Ohio and discover what's happened to it post-war.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Since Ohio is full of Deathclaws and Raiders, will there be any baby Deathclaws?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> You'll have to play through and find out.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be new weapons and rewards?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Absolutely, both new weapons and rewards. You'll get new rewards for doing the bounty hunting feature. You'll get new rewards for going through the new quest content, all sorts of new stuff for players, new mods, outfits, armors, and everything.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a favorite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> I do. I actually really like running around with The Ghoul's gun. I think that is my new favorite weapon.</p>



<p><strong>How does The Ghoul fit into the timeline of Fallout 76?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Great question. So, Fallout 76 is furthest back in time in the Fallout timeline, and the show is the furthest forward in time. And that's where we were introduced to The Ghoul on the Amazon series. Lucky for us, The Ghoul has kind of preserved himself through Ghoulification. So The Ghoul existing in the 76 timeline makes sense, although what he's doing in Ohio is still to be determined. I'm not one to question The Ghoul, I'm just gonna do what The Ghoul says.</p>



<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the influences of Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Fallout series in Burning Springs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush: </strong>We all saw season one, right? We saw where that ended up. Kyle MacLachlan's character staring out at New Vegas and then you've got the Deathclaw skull down on the ground. Once season one wrapped up, we immediately started planning for the content we wanted to make for season two.<br>Now, we didn't know exactly when season two was gonna come out, but we knew that we wanted to at least start planning that content. And then once we found out more about dates, we started planning all the patches around that, too. What we wanted to do with the new region was to really kind of remind folks of what they came to know and love in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we kind of gave to the team were, all right, it's gotta have desert, Deathclaws, and Raiders. And to me, that captures the tone and the essence and the danger of those games. So we wanted that reflected in our map expansion in Burning Springs.</p>



<p><strong>Will systems like fishing and camp building have options in Burning Springs? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>Yes, there's lots of places to build your camp in Ohio. There's gonna be a lot of really great vistas for people to build their camps in. And as we've talked about in the past, we wanna continue to expand on fishing. So there's new fish, there's new local legends, and new places to fish. And as I always say, anywhere you can swim, you can fish.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> And we have future plans for fishing as well. Fishing's been really well received by the community. We're fortunate enough that these new features that we're making, we have built them up from the ground up in a way that makes them relatively easy to expand on later down the road. So yes, Burning Springs, new fish, new local legends, and we've also got plans for seasonal fish down the road, as well as improvements and additions to the feature overall.</p>



<p><strong>When developing Burning Springs, how quickly was Walton Goggins folded in?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> When we started playing the new region, The Ghoul came about really organically. We're like, okay, here's the new region's desert, Deathclaws, and Raiders. That's the tone. What's gonna be the Hallmark feature for that new region or that update? That was bounty hunting. In a kind of barren wasteland like that, there's gonna be a lot of nefarious folks running around, so having a bounty hunting system would be a great addition for players, something fun to do. It's also a feature that we had discussed doing for a little while as well. We were just looking for the right time. Who better to host a bounty hunting feature than The Ghoul? We started talking about that and Walton Goggins is a big fan, of course, of the franchise. He's a big fan of the games. It came up sort of organically, really quickly. We had folks on our side working on the script, good folks on their side, working on the dialogue script and sort of came together. And of course, The Ghoul actually came out once Walton Goggins took the script and really made it his own, made those adjustments. It was cool to see him go from Walton Goggins to The Ghoul like that.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> He even brought the prosthetic with him to do the voice-over.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yeah, it was really awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any tips for new players who are gonna be coming to this from the TV show, as you might expect with Goggins' character?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Don't look them straight in the eyes. Yeah, that's my tip.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste: </strong>That's a good tip. <br><strong>John Rush:</strong> If you're gonna engage in the new bounty hunting feature, take up some grunt hunts. Get a feel for what The Ghoul is looking for. And then if you're lucky enough for him to give you a headhunt, or if you give him enough caps, he might give you one. He doesn't have any qualms about taking caps from Vault dwellers. Just warm up into the feature and get a feel for it before you hop into the deep end with a headhunt.</p>



<p><strong>Could you speak more about how the bounty system will work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush</strong>: This is a feature that's unique to Burning Springs. Bounties can take place in, I think we've got 20 custom locations across the map, the Super Duper Mart being one of them, and in several other really fun thematic spaces to do bounties in. When you approach The Ghoul, you'll be given the option to do these grunt hunts, right, which are kinda lower level bounties that he really doesn't have time for. He's got this huge stack of them on the table, so all of you out there need to help him out. After doing some grunt hunts, which can be done with one player, maybe two players. Once you get through some of those, lucky bounty hunters out there might come across a more prestigious contract on some of the targets, and those are called headhunts. A headhunt differs from a grunt hunt in that headhunts are much more difficult.</p>



<p>Think of a headhunt as a public event, which it actually is. Anybody on the server can join and help you take out the target, and you'll need that help because the headhunt targets are tough. But they're also really, really rewarding. There's lots of new, unique rewards that you'll encounter along the way, as well as lots of experience and caps. Per server, there can be one headhunt active at any time, while there can be as many grunt hunts as players want. You can do those till you're blue in the face, but one headhunt at a time. But like I said, they're public events, so despite there only being one at a time, everybody can hop on to help. I suspect there will probably be a steady stream of grunt hunts going on, and always at least one headhunt going on. There's a whole bunch of named targets and they also have thematic gangs they're with. Like you could run into a gang of Raiders, you could run into a gang of clowns, you could run into a gang of musicians, or even a gang of grannies. If you multiply that across the different types of locations and the different people coming to help you, you'll have a lot of variety in these headhunt public events.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I think the one thing we've created here, especially with Highway Town, is a hub for players to gather. We haven't really had a space like that before, other than the boss events. When somebody launched a nuke, you went to kill the Scorch Beast Queen. But now, you have players going into an interior cell. They're in the last resort with each other together, so they can find public teams to join, and go out and do these hunts together. It's a really cool addition, and I don't know if it was by accident or on purpose, but that's what it's created. And I think that's a really cool aspect of what we've got there.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> Bill, it was on purpose.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Ah, got it.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> But it is very unique. I think it's probably the hallmark unique feature of this new update, Burning Springs. I can't think of another space in the game that's like that, perhaps maybe top of the world, but even so, that's not really a community gathering space. It kind of feels like Diamond City from Fallout four, except, of course, Fallout 4 isn't multiplayer, but it's just kind of that big, expansive community gathering hub. We'd like to bring in vendors in that space down the road, unique vendors and really, really play it up as a place where players go to meet and talk about wasteland stuff.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The one thing we've created here with Highway Town is a hub for players to gather. We haven't really had a space like that before, other than the boss events. When somebody launched a nuke, you went to kill the Scorch Beast Queen. But now, you have players going into an interior cell. They're in the last resort with each other together, so they can find public teams to join, and go out and do these hunts together. <br></em><br><em>It kind of feels like Diamond City from Fallout four, except, of course, Fallout 4 isn't multiplayer, but it's just kind of that big, expansive community gathering hub.

<p><strong>Is there a finite number of bounties from The Ghoul, or will it repopulate? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> There's an infinite amount of people in the Wasteland who need to be taken out and The Ghoul does not have time to do it himself.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a recommended level to start Burning Springs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> There's not really a recommended level. We've always said that we wanted players to play Fallout 76 exactly how they wanted to play it. Even if you're a new player coming out of the Vault, you're gonna get some directions towards Burning Springs immediately, right there. But the first thing I usually tell people is to join a public team, see what those people are doing, take advantage of the XP boost from the intelligence, but take it slow as well. Just enjoy the game for what it is. As we've always said, Appalachia is the main character of this whole game. There are lots of notes, there are lots of holotapes, there's lots of characters now, especially after Wastelands, tons of NPCs in the world. Tons of new quests, tons of new regions now, and now we're in Ohio. Enjoy it. Take your leisurely stroll, explore. Especially if you're a new player, my only guidance is that if you see a headhunt on the screen, don't immediately jump into it. I would say go to Point Pleasant, take a nice stroll across the Buckman Bridge. Make your way up to the compound. Just really kind of understand the story a little bit and get into it. It's gonna be really cool. And the vista, the reveal you'll get at the end of that quest, is cool too.</p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> What we really strive for with new players and what we're really building towards with all of these updates that we've been doing, like letting players choose loadouts and revisiting the workshop UI and the free build rules, is that we're really trying to encourage players once they come out of the Vault to choose their own path. You wanna do the main quest, go ahead. You want to go explore, feel free. You want to take your new shotgun and go blow the heads off of Ghouls, have at it. The Ghoul is going to be in more places than just Highway Town. People who have never even gone to Highway Town in this update will encounter The Ghoul. In some instances, new players coming out of the Vault will encounter The Ghoul. If those Vault dwellers are brazen enough to take The Ghoul up on his offer to do some bounty hunting up in Highway Town and they run into some trouble, so be it. I'm not gonna stop 'em.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> No, not at all.</p>



<p><strong>Is Highway Town Hub the only non-hostile town, or are there others in Burning Springs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I mean, the Wasteland is pretty hostile in general...<br><strong>John Rush: </strong>I wouldn't say that Highway Town is safe. There's some nefarious folks there. Nowhere is safe. Keep your eyes on your caps, folks, when you're walking around Highway Town. </p>



<p><strong>Can we expect to encounter any new cryptics in this region?</strong></p>



<div><p><strong>John Rush:</strong> No brand new cryptids at this time, but you're gonna find cryptids that you're familiar with that are a bit different because of the new region and the unique elements in that space.</p><p><strong>Can we expect Burning Springs to bring new information to the canon of the Fallout universe?</strong></p></div>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Like I said, we've never explored this part of the map. Even just the small sliver of Ohio being added does influence the lore of Fallout as a whole.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Yeah. As most people know, there's only a handful of references to Ohio throughout Fallout, so it's really great to have a little bit of a blank slate in a region that we can kind of establish some early lore for the game.</p>



<p><strong>Can we cross to Ohio at any point, or is the Point Pleasant Bridge the only way to get there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I think there are certain parts that you can cross the waterway into Ohio. But yeah, I would advise everybody to just go across the bridge. But there are small points along the way you can swim, though most of it is closed off.</p>



<p><strong>How many locations are in Burning Springs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> It's like, if this is Skyline Valley, it's bigger. I think there are over 20 new points of interest. Tons of new locations. <br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> It's very similar to Savage Divide 'cause it's also long across that area.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> Savage Divide is long. You gotta add up the square footage and wrap it all together.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> It's a pretty big space.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>If this is Skyline Valley, Burning Springs is bigger. I think there are over 20 new points of interest. Tons of new locations. It's a pretty big space.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>With Fallout 3 and New Vegas as major inspirations, would you say that this new expansion is darker or grittier than past content?</strong></p>



<p>J<strong>ohn Rush:</strong> It kind of depends on who's experiencing the content. I would say tonally it's very similar. Whether you think that's dark or not is more of a character call.</p>



<p><strong>How does it feel to see just how far Fallout 76 has come so many years after release?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Oh, absolutely fantastic. I know John's been here from the very beginning. I got into Bethesda a little bit before Wasteland. So, being able to see that whole integration of NPCs and then also that was what, update 18, and now we're on 64. It's been an amazing trek to be able to be part of some of the development of those features and bring all these new features to players and new regions and also just new systems within the game to be able to bring to players.</p>



<p>Something that doesn't get talked about a lot is that we have always been very much open to revisiting systems and rewriting them and actually making them better for Fallout 76 players, which we've done over the course of this last year. Even adding The Ghoul into the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding Gleaming Depths into the game</a>, doing all of our combat rebalancing. Trust us, it's going in the right direction. The gunplay is a lot tighter than it used to be. You have LMGs now that you can actually aim down sights and shoot around.<br>All the things we've been building up to towards this Burning Springs update and everything we've done since, even before Wastelands, has been a real treat and an amazing experience to be part of. We're very, very proud of this game. John and I both have over a thousand hours plus playing as our own personal characters, not just in the office as we do as devs anyway. We are invested in multiple characters, so we are just as much fans of the game as you all are. That's why whenever you all send us feedback, we're in alignment with you most of the time, you know, 'cause we wanna see those things too. We do our best to try to bring those to you. The journey has just been amazing and so very happy to be part of this along with John and the rest of the team. It's been great.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think that the Burning Springs update will make it easier for new Fallout 76 players to get started, or is it more aimed at veterans?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> I would say that the last several updates will make it easier for new players, right? That's something we are always keeping our eyes on, ways to remove the friction so players can just hop in and start doing things and having fun. Things like the combat rebalance, the Workshop UI, and the free builders update are all being done in an effort to make it easier for new players, as well as the loadouts they can choose from when they leave the Vault. And we're talking about ways down the road to make it even easier for folks to get in. Some small things, small adjustments, and some really big, but you'll have to stay tuned in for those. Burning Springs specifically, things being done to make it easier for new players? Well, it's gonna be really easy to find Burning Springs. It's gonna be really easy to find Highway Town and The Ghoul for those who want to hop into bounty hunting early.</p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I mean, I think it's got something for everybody. Even the grunt hunts are something you could do at a much earlier, you know, level. Even headhunts, I would just say don't try them solo, they are actually similar boss battles that you have to take on, but if you start one up, I guarantee you most of the server is going to immediately jump in and help out. There's a lot for everybody, especially explorers and then also builders and adventurers. There's something for everybody across this whole patch.</p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yeah. I think if anything, a new player is going to find a wide array of things they can reasonably do fresh outta the Vault.</p>



<p><strong>Considering that The Ghoul will be central to this expansion, can we expect any changes in how the world deals with us when we are Ghouls?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yes. More specific to The Ghoul. Big changes to players playing as a Ghoul are being talked about and planned for later. However, in this update, you will find specific choices that somebody playing as a Ghoul will have to make, as well as some of the rewards for headhunts include mods that benefit specifically Ghouls, so there is content in there for Ghouls.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> The one thing we talked about <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-qa-the-game-is-thriving-and-we-have-no-plans-to-stop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when doing the Ghouls update</a> was that content going forward needed to consider the Ghouls, and sometimes that adds a little more work to our plate, but we didn't wanna leave that out. That is a major part of continuing on that story and making sure that characters in the world and other parts of the game recognized that you were a Ghoul, and this is definitely one of those steps.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> When we start out on a new big feature, one of the first questions that we'll ask ourselves is, how does this benefit Ghouls? Specifically, how does this support players who've made that decision? For instance, if we were ever to make a raid 2, we would definitely take Ghouls into consideration in how they interact with the raid.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Big changes to players playing as a Ghoul are being talked about and planned for later. However, in this update, you will find specific choices that somebody playing as a Ghoul will have to make, as well as some of the rewards for headhunts include mods that benefit specifically Ghouls, so there is content in there for Ghouls.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How far in advance was the new expansion content planned, and how far ahead have you planned for the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> I'll answer the second one first. We've got stuff planned for years down the road. Everything that we've done in the past couple of years or so on Fallout 76 has been great in shaping up the game, giving our early, mid-level players hundreds of hours of stuff to do, and that is not even counting the building and exploring. And we've been giving our elder players challenging experiences to tackle with raids and of course with the headhunts coming up. So, stuff for down the road is just gonna get bigger and better for everybody.</p>



<p>As for Burning Springs, once season one hit, we had our updates coming out around that time and they were kind of more cosmetic, right? Seeing how awesome season one was and how much everybody loved it, including myself, we started immediately planning for season two. Again, we didn't know the date that season two was coming out. We just knew that when season two hit, we wanted something that was totally in line and big. That's where Burning Springs came in. </p>



<p><strong>What will happen to the remaining <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milepost Zero content</a>, and will there be more to Skyline Valley and the Ghouls in Appalachia?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> So, we are gonna be shutting down Milepost Zero. We are moving windy over to Highway Town, so you'll be able to gather a lot of the stuff there. I believe the number of Raiders and the volatility around Skyline Valley has caused Milepost to rethink their engagement in doing caravans around the Skyline Valley area.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> Skyline Valley's become too hostile even for the Blue Ridge Caravan Company. There's a lot of nefarious folks running around Skyline Valley, and as I mentioned before, Bounty hunting could be expanding to other places, but nothing official right now. You have to stay tuned.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be any new recipes or mods specific to the new region that you can talk about?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yes, there will be. There's several mods that you can earn from doing headhunts. Really good ones that I think players are gonna be using, both humans and Ghouls. There's unique stuff when you nuke this new region. However, you cannot nuke Highway Town. Everywhere else, feel free and see what happens. I know Rad, radhogs have a, have a funny reaction to nukes, but as Bill mentioned, there's new flora as well. And of course the nuke versions of that.</p>



<p><strong>With Fallout known as a story-heavy game, but MMOs focusing more on gameplay content, how do you balance narrative versus content for different play styles, especially in an expansion like this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Some features will kind of vary to explicitly support the story and expand upon it, right? Skyline Valley and The Lost and the whole quest arc that was going on there. While other features may not directly impact a story like that, but they kind of indirectly impact it. For instance, the fishing update, right? There's sort of these ancillary stories going off on the side that support other narratives going on in the world. So everything we put in Fallout 76, in one way or another, supports the story of our Appalachia, I guess just some to a larger degree than others.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Some of that's just because of the style of the game. Like you said, we are more focused a lot of times on new systems, new things, new ways to engage, because a lot of that quest content can be just one and done. As you all know, it takes a good bit of time to create that and get the story, the dialogue, and the characters, all spun up, and then you're done, that's it. Now we really do focus a lot more on the multiplayer aspect of it. New systems, new events and engagements that everybody can be a part of. Narrative is still important to the game, of course, because we do have adventurers who love to read about the lore and find new holotapes and messages. Those are always gonna be a staple of what we do in the game. But sometimes in terms of like, what's the balance? The balance will focus a lot more on the multiplayer aspect a lot of the time.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> There's plenty of that in Burning Springs, the holotapes and the notes, and of course, the new quest arc you will find there. But then, if you look at features like bounty hunting, there's a kind of narrative undertone there that is supported every time somebody plays the feature. It kind of lets them make their own story in Appalachia.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of the quest line, can you comment on how long the new quest line will take and if there are any new bosses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> It depends on how you play. Some people zip through it.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I don't know. Like you said, it depends on how you play the game. Like, do you read through all the dialogue and listen to the voiceover and talk to all the characters, or do you press the space bar and blitz through everything, you know? It's a substantial amount of content. There's a lot of new characters, a lot of dialogue there.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> It's never really anything that we set out to accomplish, like we've made x hours of content. What's most important to us is creating an enriching, fulfilling experience for players that, again, supports our story of Appalachia and continues telling that and enables our players to continue being able to tell their own stories.</p>



<p><strong>When will people be able to see Burning Springs on the Fallout 76 PTS?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> October 2nd. That is the planned date.</p>



<p><strong>Any plans for cross-play or cross-save?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Not at this time. We do get asked about it a lot. It is something we talk about internally, but it is just a huge technical hurdle, especially seven years into the game's development. Those are things you have to determine at the very beginning, uh, uh, when you start making the game, and right now the technical hurdle just outweighs the need for it.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> But we do discuss it. We actually discuss it; we do frequently look for any sort of paths or solutions. It's not forgotten. It's not a hard no, but it's definitely not a yes at this time.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> These things are never a hard no. It's just that there are balances there that we have to take into account. Some of these things, especially this late in the game, are just much more difficult for us to pull off.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Burning Springs is really well done. We have just a ton of new POIs to explore. The public events are great. There's so much fun to actually engage in, just so much content. I think it's one of our best updates ever. It's certainly one of our biggest in terms of map size. I feel really great about this update. It's gonna be a lot of fun and people are really gonna enjoy it.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Taking a step back after 64 updates and years of content, how are you feeling about Fallout 76 and its outlook?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> I think we're both feeling really amazing about this new region. It's gone through its phases of concept and then getting into the game and getting to be able to run around the whole environment.<br>And then all of a sudden, weather got added into it. Now you have sandstorms that come through and you see debris flying across, and then you're trying to do a headhunt, a grunt hunt, or even one of the public events, and all of a sudden there's a sandstorm. It's a really great implementation of this environment. It's really well done. We have just a ton of new POIs to explore. The public events are great.<br>There's so much fun to actually engage in, just so much content. I think it's one of our best updates ever. It's certainly one of our biggest in terms of map size. But yeah, I feel really great about this update. It's gonna be a lot of fun and people are really gonna enjoy it.</p>



<p><strong>Could you tell us if there are any Easter eggs within Fallout 76 that players still haven't found?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Yes, there are lots of Easter eggs in the game that players still haven't found. I mean, this update aside, there's stuff I can think of already. I mean, we could talk about <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-camp-revamp-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C.A.M.P. Revamp's</a> main menu video. There's some Easter eggs in that. I haven't heard anybody mention those.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Even in previous videos, there have been Easter eggs that no one has found and questioned.<br><strong>John Rush:</strong> We usually like to try to sneak little things in there to give hints.<br><strong>Bill Lacoste:</strong> Jump into the game now and watch that video all the way through and see what you can find.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has now been almost eight years since the last release of a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf5f5761-dd71-4920-a357-fb1776081165" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Digimon Story</em></a> title. This line of RPGs, not to be confused with the Monster Sim <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1404da97-a827-4374-bf72-f779c1d461a1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-world-next-order-review-were-going-digital" rel="nofollow"><em>Digimon World</em></a> titles, puts players in the shoes of a human who befriends Digimon, trains them up to be big and powerful, and ultimately saves the world. In <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, the world you explore is bigger, the roster of available Digimon is larger, and the scope of the story has increased just as much.</p>

<p>In <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger,</em> you take on the role of a protagonist investigating a phenomenon known as Digimon, protecting the secret of their existence from the world. On your latest mission, you encounter a strange phenomenon and end up being transported back in time eight years.</p>

<p>Starting with a simple investigation in the presence of Digimon in the past, the scope of the story explodes fast, allowing you to explore Shinjuku and Akihabara, expanding to not only include a vast Digital World filled with various themed areas, but also further exploration through time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-exploration.jpg?itok=YWaysTo7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-exploration.jpg?itok=xZtGw0Zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Watch out, I hear there's a strange guy dressed as a Dinosaur...</figcaption></figure><h2>The Time Stranger Was The Friend You Became Along The Way</h2>

<p>Alongside your drive to understand the time-travelling phenomenon, another mysterious part of your party is Aegiomon, a Digimon born into the human world who seems to have a great destiny ahead of him and a force of 'evil' Digimon known as Titans to fight back against.</p>

<p>The story of<em> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is big. The world is filled to the brim with characters full of personality and motive that make everywhere you go feel alive. Having had a chance to play through the demo, but also part of the game at SGF, I had a feeling the story between the opening Government Building and when you'd arrive at Central Town would be an hour or so, but getting to spend about 5-6 hours in the real world before you even set in the Digital World really set a tone for how much larger this game would become.</p>

<p>As you progress from the real world to each of the digital regions, you'll get to meet interesting characters like the Bearmon brothers, a Shellmon who wants to heal Digimon no matter whose side they're fighting for, and the leader of a forest village who likes to party, shirking off the responsibilities of watching over everyone to his second in command.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene_0.jpg?itok=q_2_BmZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene_0.jpg?itok=DlhhX9PP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three Digimon walked into a bar...</figcaption></figure><p>Getting to spend so much time in these worlds, you don't just get to grow with Aegiomon and your own party of Digimon, but see each of these important characters grow in their own ways. After spending 50+ hours in this world, seeing the growth and continued involvement of these characters pays off time and time again. It's hard to say much without giving things away, but just know there's very little 'small' characters in this unique adventure.</p>

<p>While the overall adventure was very much worth it, there were definitely times around the back third of the game where you'd revisit areas, and it did feel a bit like you were retreading familiar ground. These areas could have been tightened up a bit, but overall, the payoff of revisiting these areas was worth it.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Strangers</em> Is A Mix Of <em>Tamers </em>And <em>Savers</em></h2>

<p>For fans of Digimon, who know that the tone between Digimon adventures can be a bit all over the place, I feel like <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>was a healthy mix of <em>Digimon Tamers</em> thematically, while also taking a lot from <em>Digimon Savers</em>.</p>

<p>Side-quests are a harder part of the story to judge. For the most part, the side-quest gameplay was uninspired, having you travel between a few places and then fight a single digimon. That being said, some of my favorite side-quests were the ones where you didn't even fight a Digimon. In these, you learn more about the expanded cast of characters, their dreams and desires. These ones added a very human touch to the Digimon, blurring the line between human and Digimon, as is often a theme in these stories.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-side-quests.jpg?itok=z6yy8V1m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-side-quests.jpg?itok=ARl5rGHg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Follow the waypoint, interact with the item, follow the next waypoint...</figcaption></figure><p>In these ways, the gameplay of Side-quests didn't add to the experience, but the stories were normally worth the time. Whether you do or don't care for them, though, one of the Side-Quest rewards is a currency that will allow you to Digivolve into higher levels, so you'll need to be completing them if you want to finish the game.</p>

<p>Outside of explicit Side-Quests, there are a variety of other activities that you can take part in, including hard dungeons with unique objectives known as Outer Dungeons, and an addictive but VERY unbalanced/random card game. The Outer Dungeons are fun for a bit more of a challenge as you're making your way through the game, but the card game is really only worth it if you have nothing else to do.</p>

<h2>Combat Is Familiar For <em>SMT </em>Fans</h2>

<p>Outside of exploration, the core gameplay of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>is in its turn-based battles. Battles are up to 3x3, with an extra three Digimon as a backup in your party. Much like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9bf71acc-b777-43e6-82ec-ce923f25f256" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-v-review" rel="nofollow"><em>SMT,&nbsp;</em></a>speed is a factor, allowing you to have faster Digimon attack more often, and you'll pretty much always be upgrading or swapping around your party to find a combination that's most effective for any area you're travelling through.</p>

<p>Digimon has a combat triangle of the basic Data, Vaccine, and Virus types, but on top of that, there are a variety of types that are outside of that triangle, like No-Data or Unknown. Additionally, there are also elemental typings like Fire, Electricity, and… Steel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-boss-fight.jpg?itok=4ROgp_OA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-boss-fight.jpg?itok=5-ovVuO0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>UltimateBrachiomon has unique mechanics that will really push your team building</figcaption></figure><p>Damage calculation takes into account the type of your Digimon, as well as the type of the attack, and sometimes even the trait of an enemy Digimon can see you swinging from dealing no damage at all, to dealing five times the amount of possible damage. It can be very satisfying to have everything line up correctly, but having so many variables also means you can take a Digimon who normally wouldn't be effective against an opponent and give them an ability or attack that will allow them to deal bonus damage. Here you'll end up doing 1.5x damage, or even weird variables like 2.3x damage.</p>

<p>I really appreciated these gameplay options, especially as I was getting to the end of the game and was honing in on my 'optimal' team. I could make sure that they were well-rounded as a team, but also within themselves. No matter who your favorite Digimon is, there's a way to have them be viable and take them on your adventure.</p>

<p>You can alter a Digimon's strengths and abilities even further by equipping them with a wide variety of different attacks and by equipping them with attachments that can boost their stats or allow them to resist certain damage types and status conditions.</p>

<p>Boss fights add even more complication as these massive Digimon don't just have more HP and deal more damage, but they'll also have different mechanical gimmicks or will pause at certain times to charge up and launch massive attacks. While I was able to defeat pretty much all of the bosses on my first try, I was normally pushing myself to the finish line with my 'all-rounder' team.</p>

It also reinforced the idea that you could take your favorites with you and get through most battles. For those bosses that were too difficult with my all-rounder team, I was always able to spend 5-10 minutes looking through my roster, setting them up with some good attacks, and coming back with an incredibly powerful and specific team.</p>

<h2>Raising Digimon Is A Full Time Job</h2>

<p>Another meaty aspect of gameplay for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is in its monster evolution mechanics. Digimon have between six and seven different stages of growth from Baby to Mega+, and unlike other popular monster raising video games, Digimon have all kinds of crazy branched evolution. Your cat head might become a bipedal fox, who, after spending some time as a bird with a bush for a tail, becomes a sentient blob with an attachment to jewelry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digivolution.jpg?itok=f1Ax9aC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digivolution.jpg?itok=_OTg_M5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>De-digivolving can lead you to just as many strange places as Digivolution, and as your Digimon continues to grow and change, its skill ceiling also rises, promoting the idea of you not just digivolving a Digimon into its most powerful form, but to let it run free across the digivolution tree.</p>

<p>To successfully Digivolve a Digimon, it needs to meet certain stat requirements; Greymon might become MetalGreymon with 592 HP and 520 ATK, but if you want a SkullGreymon, you need 1250 ATK and 1060 DEF.</p>

<p>I love the way that digivolution works in this game, there's certain Digimon that will have an easier 'natural' path of evolution but for the most powerful Digimon, or those that require special conditions like Armor or DNA/Jogress Digivolution you'll have to be paying more attention, creating a more powerful Digimon, and even interacting with them in certain ways.</p>

<p>A new mechanic to <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is Personalities. Each Digimon can have one of sixteen possible personality types. These personalities affect which certain stats might grow faster, but they can also imbue a Digimon with a special ability. One of my favorites is Cheer, which increases ATK and INT at the start of a battle based on the bond of the battle members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-agent-skills.jpg?itok=cqWVEROB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-agent-skills.jpg?itok=VnqzwkCS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buy Agent Skills to increase the Digimon you can digivolve into, as well as increase their stats</figcaption></figure><p>Personality was a mechanic that I mostly ignored during my playthrough. The benefits that it could imbue would definitely lend to certain Digimon digivolving in certain ways faster… but I also found that just leveling them up or powering them up with other Digimon was also a fast way to get the stats that I needed.</p>

<p>You'll be happy to know that, aside from needing certain personalities for Jogress evolution, it won't come into play much, but for those who are excited to dive into the Mega+ difficulty mode, having a Digimon with a specific personality will be a key factor to surviving.</p>

<p>It's great to see so many new and fan favorite Digimon are part of the roster of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, but it's also a bit weird to see some of the exclusions. The biggest space I can see is the main digimon from Frontiers, with Spirits for Fire and Light present and Ranamon available, but none of the other Spirits are part of the game.</p>

<p>That being said, there were some fascinating entries with returning fan favorites like the Royal Knights, and Seven Deadly Sins, alongside some newer Digimon like MagnaKidmon, Beelstarmon, and the Olympux XII.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-party.jpg?itok=RPuAJEzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-party.jpg?itok=24nh_RMB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of familiar faces, as well as new ones</figcaption></figure><p>As a side, you can really tell with the work being done on establishing a greater lore to connect and differentiate the Digimon games. While the past two <em>Digimon Story</em> titles pulled inspiration from the stories of the standard Digital World, this game takes place in the Iliad and references the original server as well as Shambala. Alongside the strong performance of this game, it also makes me very excited for the future of the series.</p>

<h2>Quality Of Life Updates</h2>

<p>As a longtime fan of JRPGs, I am always down for some turn-based combat and occasional grinding. There are a lot of specific things that<em> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> does to make sure the experience is always a good one, and that it doesn't feel like you're having your time wasted.</p>

<p>In combat, you can see the effectiveness of moves if you've used their types previously, or if you've had that Digimon before. This is helpful to make battles efficient, while also rewarding the work you've done filling out your Digimon field guide. Battles can also be sped up to 5x; this also cuts out certain animations, meaning that even when you're 50+ hours into the game, the combat never feels like a chore.</p>

<p>In the overworld, there are no random encounters, and you can pre-emptively strike your opponents. If you're strong enough, you won't even enter combat; you'll just be rewarded with experience, money, and items as if you fought that battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-bank.jpg?itok=yvCm02iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-bank.jpg?itok=yP2F5vv4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Access your Digimon Bank from ANYWHERE</figcaption></figure><p>Some direct improvements from previous <em>Digimon Story</em> games are that you can access your bank of Digimon from anywhere, and you can also Digivolve from anywhere. This cuts out a lot of time that might have been spent running to and from the Digi-Farm. Additionally, there are a number of different ways to fast-travel around the world. No more getting too deep into a dungeon and having to slowly walk out, fighting random encounters along the way.</p>

<p>The Digi-Farm is one area that has fallen to the wayside with all of these enhancements. What was previously a place to let your Digimon gain experience when not travelling with you, and to train up specific stats, it still does those things… but when Digimon in your Bank earn EXP regardless, and it's so much nicer to just have them with you, I spent little to no time using the Digi-Farm.</p>

<p>This feature, much like the personality system, is one that I'm sure will be integral to the hardest difficulty modes, but for the standard game, you'll not likely need it.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's been a long time since the release of the last <em>Digimon Story</em> game, and with a grand story, the establishment of a new Digital World, a complex and addictive combat system, and hundreds of Digimon to explore, <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is an excellent new entry to the franchise.</p>

<p>The story grabbed me from the get-go wth an explosive launch and had me eager to learn more throughout the entire story, even if some sections dragged on a bit. Side-Missions were the weakest aspect, and while they were a snooze gameplay-wise, they certainly added more to the world and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The core monster raising and digivolution was straightforward enough to learn and get good at, but there's also plenty for min/maxers to really dive into between the personality types, abilities, and training at the Digi-Farm.</p>

<p>This isn't just a good title for those familiar with Digimon and <em>Digimon Story</em> titles to purchase and play, but it's also a great entry point for fans of RPGs like Shin Megami Tensei who want to experience a version of that game with better monster evolution mechanics.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> </strong>was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 57 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</p>

Before you jeer at my beautiful baby boy the Tantus Tsunami, know that he has an Impact rating and a Stiffness of 3 stars. If somebody belts you with the Tantus Tsunami, you're going down like a sack of potatoes. The trade-off is that he has a balance rating of 22%. Best not wave him over your head, or you might glitch out. Also, that's not a smiley face, it's a deathshead. Ah, many are those who have trembled in the glare of the Tantus Tsunami (don't google it).

If you think this is preposterous, check out the tinfoil bullshit artistry the playtesters are smashing together on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesong/">subreddit</a>. One of their swords looks like a graphics card advert from 1997. Somebody else has made a trowel. Such nonsense. No videogame would ever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shovel-knight">feature a trowel as a weapon</a> and I certainly can't think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWpCag9R9U">any parallels in film</a>, either.

This is Bladesong - or Trowelsong, or Lightsabersong, or Treewandsong, or whatever else occurs the next time you're afflicted by a strange mood and confine yourself to a workshop. It's a blacksmith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you play the chief swordwhisperer of Eren Keep - the last stronghold in a ravaged world, where humans yet cling onto some society beneath the rule of the tyrannous, messianic Masked King. Over the course of the game, you'll take on commissions from mercs and bluebloods, hire storied characters to work around the forge, enmesh yourself with factions of scholars and scavengers, and investigate the mystery of the Masked King himself. 
</p><p>
Given how prone RPGs are to showering you in weapons, I do like the idea of playing the person who crafted them. That might be just another +3 bronze scimitar with a plain square guard to <em>you</em>, chum, but it was my first commission after completing my apprenticeship. That +3 bronze scimitar paid for the anvil I'm using to forge you this +5 steel claymore with a wire grip and light-up pommel. Which you are going to discard in five minutes time because you found a +6 steel claymore under a bridge. Don't apologise. I'm used to it. All part of the trade.
</p>
<p>
As I wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-bladesong-you-are-both-the-real-hero-and-villain-of-any-fantasy-rpg-the-person-who-makes-all-the-swords">our first article about Bladesong</a>, I'm interested to know how much the design and quality of your work affects quest outcomes. I'd like to be able to indirectly assassinate people I hate by serving them really shit swords. Let's face it, simply wearing the Tantus Tsunami on your belt will probably reduce you to a quivering wreck (don't google it).</p>
<p>These are questions for the full game. Right now we have a demo with a Creative Mode, and the first thing to do in any Creative Mode demo is slam all the sliders in different directions, then hoot and holler outta the building. OK, a few of the playtesters and demo downloaders are taking things more seriously. I think the below look quite plausible, for instance.

              <p>Okay so at this point, we all understand what’s so great about having an e-reader, right? sure, some of us prefer having a physical book in hand and enjoy being able to display our collection on our shelves, but you can’t deny the convenience and practicality of having a Kindle. You can carry around thousand of books with you when you travel, not everyone has the space to keep their own little library in their home. Though, one issue a lot of e-readers have is the visibility. Staring at a backlit screen all day is not great for you, not to mention no amount of backlight will help when you’re on the beach with the sun shining down from directly overhead.</p>
<p>The Kindle Paperwhite solved this thanks to its enhanced screen that mimics the look and feel of reading a paperback. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4408/">Now, the Kindle Scribe enhances things further by adding in a pen which can be used for writing, annotating, drawing, and more</a>. Right now, Amazon happens to have the Kindle Scribe on sale for about 25% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4408/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Kindle Scribe is available with a few different storage capacities, either 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB. The 16GB model has come down from $400 to just $300. The 32GB model, previously $420, is now $315. And the 64GB option dropped from $450 to just $340. You’ll save a maximum of $110. Choose between two stylish color options as well — either tungsten or metallic jade.</p>
<h2>Streamlined Notetaking</h2>
<p>This digital notebook can be used for all of your writing and reading needs. The latest model of the Kindle Scribe even employs AI tools — the hot buzzword of 2025. It’s not generative AI here, it just is able to convert your messy handwriting into a readable font which can be pretty handy.</p>



<p>The pen and screen are designed to mimic the look and feel of pen on paper. Each stroke will feel like the real thing. Plus, no need to charge or set up the pen. It just works.</p>
<p>Easily mark-up documents right on the Kindle Scribe. PDFs can be imported to and exported from the device. Expand the margins with Active Canvas to make room for your notes, or collapse it all to see the original page.</p>
<p>The glare-free 10.2-inch screen has a 300ppi display making it easy to read comfortably in any lighting situation. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4408/">Bring it out to your porch to enjoy the nice weather, while enjoying a good book or getting some work done.</a></p>

              <p><span>Jayden Griffin, a 19-year-old from South Dakota, has pleaded guilty to sending death threats to Epic Games, the developers of the battle royale crossover hub </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>According to court documents verified by </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teen-who-threatened-to-kill-devs-at-fortnite-studio-pleads-guilty/1100-6535124/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, Griffin will face up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and a period of supervised release for up to three years after his sentence. Griffin was charged in December 2024 for messages he sent to Epic Games employees between October and November of that year. Griffin stated in a court document filed on September 16, 2025, that he “intended for the messages to be viewed as a threat at the time [he] sent the messages.”</span></p> <p><span>Griffin’s hearing concluded on September 29, with him entering a guilty plea after he’d previously pleaded not guilty in January.</span></p> <p><span>“The Court finds that the defendant is competent and capable of entering an informed plea, is aware of the nature of the charges and consequences of the plea, that the plea is knowing and voluntary and is supported by an independent basis in fact containing each of the essential elements of the offense and orders that the defendant shall be adjudged guilty of the offense,” the document reads.</span></p>

 <p><span>Online death threats are sadly pretty commonplace in the gaming space, though it’s not often they go to court and someone is sentenced. A lot of people view this toxicity as just an expected part of being online, so it’s often allowed to permeate without any consequences. You can check most social media sites and find anonymous profiles throwing them out left and right. Pretty much everyone is fair game in the eyes of people who make these threats, as developers, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035"><span>actors</span></a><span>, and even critics and journalists who write about video games have had to endure torrents of threats.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Epic Games for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>

I don’t just mean in the sense that it shows humans and digital monsters banding together to save their respective worlds of reality and a digital simulacra, but that it ebbs and flows from mundane slice-of-life to devastating melodrama. Sadly, those contrasts in tone are often matched by contrasts in quality, with the game’s exceptional moments often sandwiched between less compelling ones. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>oscillates between what feels like slow-burning filler and an angsty, tragic disaster story that centers the digital monsters you meet, train, and befriend over the course of your journey. For almost 30 years now, I’ve consistently admired </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-digimon-game-cyber-sleuth-world-survive-next-order-2000629304"><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> desire to make sure that the digital monsters are just as much people as the humans who tame them. That same inclination is woven into the mechanics of what, without it, could easily have been a rote turn-based RPG. Like a good friendship, </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>is an investment you have to be willing to make, enduring its awkward early moments to get to the raw and sappy center. It’s worth it.</span></p> <p><span>Like most </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>stories, </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>is fairly separate from any of the previous games, though its lore and mythology will be familiar to anyone who’s been on this ride for a while. You are an agent of an organization called ADAMAS, which investigates strange digital anomalies in the human world, only for one mission to end up with far more dire consequences than you or your superiors could have anticipated. As Digimon begin to spill out into the human world, a giant, humanoid machine descends upon Japan. The ensuing conflict creates a cataclysmic explosion that wipes out everyone in its path…except for you, who miraculously survives but is thrown eight years in the past. The world is headed toward apocalyptic ruin, unless you can stop the disaster set to happen in eight years.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630351"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630351">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As the name implies, </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>is a time travel story, and its timeline-hopping is one of the biggest contributors to its sometimes uneven pacing, with long stretches feeling oddly disconnected from what you were just doing, until they’re very suddenly not. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>wades into well-worn “fix the past to save the future” tropes until it takes some surprising left turns that reveal it to be a far more elaborate story than it initially appears. The script often betrays the story with awkward, unnatural, and overexpository dialogue, but the emotional heartbeat is still pulsating underneath that stilted delivery. The main trio consists of your agent and a pair of stragglers ADAMAS suspects may be at the center of the incoming apocalypse: the faun-like Digimon Aegiomon and his tamer, Inori. </span></p>

 <p><span>For much of </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>, the player is a voyeur to their growing partnership, but as the party’s time-traveling antics gradually become more complicated and everyone is more invested in their success, those bonds may end up endangering everyone. Aegiomon’s childlike gusto and need to save those he cares about are the unchecked and unrestrained catalysts for so much of </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>, to the point where he, rather than the agent, is arguably the main character. But I still found my role in the whole story compelling, as it was my duty as an agent that was constantly at odds with the pair’s loyalty to one another. </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> knows the power of friendship conquers all, but it is also such a powerful, untamable force that it threatens to unravel the same ties that strengthen it. Everyone in this game is looking for somewhere to belong, and they’re willing to take it from even the most imperfect of places.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630348"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630348">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span> has always tried to make the monsters themselves feel more like characters than just a cute or cool face for stats and numbers, and </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>extends this to your own party who, along with fighting your battles for you, have distinct personalities that are influenced by your decisions. You can talk to them as they follow you around in the overworld and have brief back-and-forths that are both very specific to the monster in question and lean into one of the designated dispositions they can have that determine their stats and dialogue. Talking with the cat-like Digimon Gatomon about the powerful Holy Ring she wears around her tail, or the werewolf Digimon WereGarurumon about his sick, ripped jeans, are small interactions in the grand scheme of things, but they do a lot to make the specific monsters you’re journeying alongside feel like more than just disposable, interchangeable units in an RPG party. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>has so many delightful touches that make your party feel like part of the world, whether that’s in these chats or when it lets you ride on your Growlmon’s shoulders to get around faster.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914"><i><span>Cyber Sleuth</span></i><span>, the last game in the </span><i><span>Story </span></i><span>subseries</span></a><span>, took place primarily in a sleek cyberspace that centered most of the human characters and made the Digimon themselves feel like programs above all else. Though its story delved into some of the series’ best mythology and had a really novel noir premise, it often felt like my favorite little guys were just mechanical extensions of my character, rather than living, breathing people on their own. </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> splits its time between real-world Tokyo and the Digital World of Illiad, which is full of bustling villages and beautiful vistas. Walking through Central Town, seeing Digimon in their own society and living out little mini-stories that span the game’s long timeline does a lot to make the Digital World feel like a real place that I can touch and exist in alongside my Digimon friends. When I first set foot in this world, I met young, scrappy Digimon who would become older, world-weary warriors when I jumped forward in time. Your time-hopping in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>changes the world in big and small ways, and seeing those mini-narratives pay off each time you move through the timeline is almost as rewarding as watching your own Digimon digivolve over the course of your adventure.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those digivolution mechanics are still one of the most enthralling parts of </span><i><span>Time Stranger,</span></i><span> as they were in </span><i><span>Cyber Sleuth</span></i><span> and other games. Digimon don’t have set, linear evolutions, and one of the most challenging and captivating parts of raising these critters is training them to achieve a desired evolutionary result. From the outset, you have access to most of the Digimon in </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s roster because you can create several of the early-stage creatures before you leave the first dungeon. Within an hour of play, I had my three favorites ready to go, and they accompanied me throughout the entirety of </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s 40-hour runtime. This is possible because if you have the patience and forethought to move through the evolutionary chart, you can turn just about any Digimon into any other in the game. The entire roster is interconnected in a web of evolution and devolution that you can move through at will as long as your stats match up. Evolving and devolving will help you reach more powerful forms, as every change, whether it’s up or down the evolutionary line, will increase your level cap and help you break through the ceilings that prevent you from reaching your favorite, most powerful monsters. Again, </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>is an investment that rewards patience, and once you understand how to game its systems, it becomes a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><span>more malleable and experimental monster tamer than most of its contemporaries</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630352"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630352">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>makes these potentially overwhelming systems more accessible thanks to a swath of quality-of-life changes that let you adapt, train, and create Digimon more easily than ever. A lot of the management has been moved to the pause menu, sparing you the need to head back to the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>equivalent of </span><i><span>Persona</span></i><span>’s Velvet Room every time you want to digivolve a monster or swap your party around. Digimon who are in your storage still gain experience when they’re not in battle, so the grind has become pretty much a non-factor. If you find you’ve got a bunch of Digimon you don’t want, you can transfer their data into your main party to level them up quickly, and all of this is conveniently at your fingertips rather than being a separate detour you have to take when you’re in the middle of doing something else. More than most monster tamers, </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>gives you the tools to write your party’s story right out the gate, and if you’re anything like me and have a neurotic attachment to your favorites, you know how much of a difference it makes to have your mains with you as early on the journey as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all sentimentality, though. What does having your favorites early on actually mean in the long run in this turn-based battle system? At a glance, </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s fights aren’t anything special or game-changing for the genre. It has some of </span><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span>’s bespoke dressings like the Data, Vaccine, and Virus attributes that give every monster an inherent rock-paper-scissors-style strength and weakness, but otherwise leans into the standard elemental and physical/magical attack split which can feel pretty unremarkable. </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s new flourishes come in the form of randomized timing-based abilities and reactions that don’t quite reach </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> levels of challenge and impact, but can activate passive abilities tied to each Digimon’s personality. So a Friendly Digimon might throw a buff on their team if you hit the surprise QTE, whereas a Courageous one might land an extra attack before their turn ends. This, on top of the dialogue you can exchange with your Digimon in the overworld, incentivizes you to nudge your party to different personality archetypes, both to round out the party dynamic and to best complement the strategies you’ve built along the way. In most of the random battles, this doesn’t amount to much, but in </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s many, </span><i><span>many</span></i><span> boss fights, they’re a boon that can help turn a scrap around.</span></p> <p><span>Even on the normal difficulty, </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s biggest fights can often feel like drawn-out wars of attrition rather than encounters that require much strategy or have you cleverly outsmarting a system. I gave myself self-imposed challenges to amp up the difficulty, such as only using my three-person team of the Guilmon, Gabumon, and Salamon lines, despite having six slots available in my party. Doing so meant I didn’t have a spread of all three attributes for most of the mid-game, which required me to get creative when handling certain Digimon without weaknesses I could readily exploit. The attribute system is usually a key starting point in determining your best match-ups, but elemental affinities can also bridge the gap if you’re lacking in a Data Digimon to rough up the opposing Vaccine. Even so, the biggest challenge of </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s battles isn’t usually strategic; it’s in the HP walls the game calls boss fights, which can take ages to whittle down.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630350">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The bosses in this game hit hard, and they take hits like tanks. The difficulty spike on some of these battles can be so stark that it almost makes you think </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s battles are more complex than they actually are, because even with some of the new mechanics shaking things up like the Cross Arts that let you charge up a high-impact support ability of your choosing over the course of a battle, these fights are mostly a game of numbers going up and down. But that’s the trap a lot of turn-based RPGs tend to fall into, especially ones that can’t guarantee you’ll have specific characters or archetypes in your party. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> is a recent example of a turn-based RPG creating interesting challenges and puzzles to solve within its fights, but that was because it knew the party you would have and how their various kits would synergize with one another. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>gives you a lot of freedom to make your own strategies, but the end result of its challenges is mostly the same. Occasionally, a boss will throw you for a loop by reflecting certain attacks or using spells that alter its attributes, so you have to pivot to creating openings for a different Digimon to exploit its new weakness, but the answer to this doesn’t change; only the Digimon who delivers it does. When </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>offers you a challenging fight, it is a tug of war decided by who can hit harder and heal faster, and while I gave myself a few restrictions that required me to get creative, the average battle is probably going to be a cakewalk for anyone with turn-based battle experience.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s biggest detriment, however, is in how its otherwise experimental and rewarding progression system is undermined by the game’s time-traveling story. You can unlock new evolution levels by raising your Agent Rank, which you do by completing quests. </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> has different questlines available to you depending on where you are in the timeline, and for the majority of the game, you can’t jump between the past and present at will. This means if you don’t do a ton of sidequests in the beginning of the game, you’ll be leaving Agent Rank points on the table, and may not be able to get the most powerful versions of your team until much, </span><i><span>much</span></i><span> later in the game. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does warn you that you won’t be able to complete side quests until later before you make this jump, but it does not prepare you for the dozens of hours between then and the next time you’ll be able to cross those off your list. Broadly, I liked this system when I felt like it was giving me a sense of how far along their evolutionary lines your team should be, as every tier of transformation is gated by a designated level you would, in theory, naturally reach as you progressed through the game. But when I reached the endgame and still hadn’t encountered enough sidequests to reach my party’s final forms, I was annoyed at the game’s inability to communicate to me that the dozen or so quests I left behind wouldn’t be finished until around 30 hours later.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Digimon Story: Time Stranger           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“I get by with a little help from my friends.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Media.Vision</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Turn-based monster-taming RPG.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Rewarding evolution mechanics, great story and characters, the Digital World feels more alive than ever.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Awkward, unnatural dialogue, battle system is still pretty unremarkable, the side quest gating is diabolical</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5 (played on), PC, Xbox Series X/S</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>October 3, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~40 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Because these fights are mostly paint-by-numbers, the true satisfaction in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>comes from raising your favorite Digimon from a tiny baby into an often fearsome beast of a Mega form, and even with its frustrations, it’s more than enough to make up for a pretty bog-standard battle system. It is both the monster-taming genre’s gift and its curse that you’re forming personal connections with your team, often at the expense of a more complex battle system. The trade-off works in </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>’s favor, though, as it delivers the kind of human-Digimon human and Digimon connections you show up for. It also makes excellent use of the series’ mythology and, like other recent games in the series, it demonstrates a welcome willingness to age up along with its audience. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>sometimes awkwardly fumbles its way to the point it’s trying to make, but every time it shows its hand, it proves it’s willing to punch above its weight.&nbsp;</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last month, it was reported that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-digital-edition-reportedly-gets-surprise-downgrade-in-europe/1100-6534436/">PS5 was getting a surprise downgrade</a> in Europe, as the 1TB SSD was being shrunk to 825GB on the digital edition console. The CFI-2100 model has been confirmed for that region, and in addition to the smaller SSD, it also features several other changes designed to reduce its costs.</p><p>While this has resulted in a slightly lighter PS5 console that will presumably be cheaper to produce and ship, these savings will not be passed on to the consumer, as it will still retail for €500--roughly $586--when stock enters the market and replaces the current PS5 Digital console model.</p><p>YouTuber Austin Evans has unboxed this new model, revealing the changes inside the PS5 console. The smaller SSD now has 667.2GB of storage capacity when compared to the 848.0GB of usable space that was available with the 1TB model--a reduction of 27%. Several components are also lighter, and the black central casing now has a matte finish.</p><p>Crucially, power and performance remain the same when compared to older PS5 console models, but consumers will want to consider expanding their storage capacity by installing a secondary NVMe SSD.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrxVnRxLo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-0UrxVnRxLo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This year has been tough for gamers, as console hardware prices have continued to increase across the industry. In April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/">Sony increased the price for Digital and Standard Edition PS5 consoles</a> across Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and in August, the PS5 consoles increased by $50 in the US for all models. Sony said it was continuing to navigate a "challenging" economic environment, resulting in the console price increases.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has raised the price of its Xbox Series X|S consoles twice this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">The first price increase came in May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">another round of price hikes</a> was announced in late September. The company's entry-level 512GB Xbox Series S console now costs $400--up from its 2020 launch price of $300--and the 1TB Xbox Series X console now retails for $650, which is a substantial jump from its original November 2020 launch price of $500.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced another Xbox Game Pass price hike, with the Ultimate tier going up to $30/month. Microsoft is making this change just ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's release.</p><p>For now, however, you can still get a one-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription for $20 at Amazon.</p><p>Microsoft is making the price changes as part of a wider claim that it's giving people "more" than before to help justify the price hike. "We know not everyone wants the same thing in their Xbox experience, so we’re evolving Game Pass to offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players," Microsoft said.</p><h2><strong>New plan names and pricing</strong></h2><p>Beginning today, October 1, Microsoft is rolling out three "upgraded" Game Pass tiers, including Essential, Premium, and Ultimate. The Xbox Game Pass Core tier is being removed, with people on that plan automatically shifted to Essential. Additionally, the Standard tier is gone as well, with members shifted to the Premium plan. The Ultimate plan is staying the same, at least in terms of its name.</p><ul><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Essential</strong> -- $10/month</li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> -- $15/month</li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong> -- $30/month</li></ul><h2><strong>Game Pass Ultimate gets "biggest upgrade yet" with these perks</strong></h2><p>Game Pass Ultimate is seeing a 50% price increase from $20/month to $30/month, and Microsoft said the tier is getting the "biggest upgrade yet," but what does that actually mean?</p><p>For Game Pass Ultimate, subscribers are now getting "more day-one games than ever before," along with access to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/fortnite-crew-subscription?lang=en-US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Crew</a> and <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/ubisoftplus/classics?lang=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Classics</a>. Members also get "enhanced" Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality up to 1440p. Fortnite Crew, which costs $12/month by itself, comes to Game Pass Ultimate on November 18. Fortnite Crew gives members the latest Fortnite battle pass, along with 1,000 V-Bucks each month, in addition to other benefits. Ubisoft+ Classics, meanwhile, costs $16/month on its own and includes a variety of Ubisoft gams for PC, console, and the cloud.</p><p>Another perk added to Game Pass Ultimate is "best quality streaming and shortest wait times" for Xbox Cloud Gaming. Additionally, Xbox Cloud Gaming has now officially left "beta" and is now at 1.0.</p><p>There are also Rewards program perks for Game Pass Ultimate members who subscribe for the new, more expensive price. "With our upgraded Rewards program, players can get up to 30% value on select Game Pass games, with 4x points on purchases of games and add-ons, 10% back in points on select Game Pass library titles and add-ons, and up to 20% off select Game Pass games," Microsoft said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRcXlQs98n4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bRcXlQs98n4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft has increased the price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, along with a shake up of its tiers.</p>
<p>Game Pass Ultimate will now cost $29.99 / £22.99 per month. It includes access to over 75 day one releases a year, Microsoft stated in a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">Xbox Wire</a> post, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. Cloud gaming is also set to receive a boost in quality, and there's a new <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/rewards?msockid=1efb4690959367cf2528530694e166b5">Rewards programme</a> too.</p>
<p>The price change comes with a change to the existing tiers. PC Game Pass is no more; now it's rolled into each of the three tiers available. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Pass Essential ($9.99, £6.99, €8.99/month) - offering 50+ games across PC, console, and cloud</li>
<li>Game Pass Premium ($14.99, £10.99, €12.99/month) - offering 200+ games across PC, console and cloud</li>
<li>Game Pass Ultimate ($29.99, £22.99, €26.99/month) - offering 400+ games across PC, console and cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Day one game releases are only included in the Ultimate tier. The Essential tier is the smallest, curated library of games. Current Standard subscribers will be automatically upraded to the Premium tier.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The Game Pass shake up comes alongside a change to Microsoft Rewards. From today, users will no longer be able to directly redeem Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p>
<p>Instead, you'll need to redeem your points for a gift card in a denomination sufficient to cover the cost of the subscription, and use this to purchase.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-made-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-this-year-countering-recent-criticism-of-subscription-services-value">ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla discussed the current state of Game Pass</a> with Eurogamer, stating this year marks Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date".</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal," he said. "This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Charla's comments follow criticism of the service, amid debate around how subscription services cannibalise direct sales of games, as well as questions on whether Game Pass is profitable.</p>
<p>This increase in the price of a Game Pass subscription would certainly indicate it's not as profitable as Microsoft would wish it to be. That's despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">subscription hitting almost $5bn in annual revenue last year</a>, as Microsoft overall saw an 18 percent increase in revenue to $76.4bn.</p>
<p>It also comes just days after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">hardware price hike in the US</a>, with Xbox consoles now costing between $80 and $130 more.</p>

            <p>The Ghoul from Amazon's Fallout TV series is set to appear in the new region coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, as played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Burning Springs will be the largest (and free!) update to the MMORPG since 2020, and will include all-new Bounty Hunting missions hosted by The Ghoul and voiced by Goggins.</p>
<p>Goggins' character proved popular in the TV series, as one of three lead characters alongside Ella Purnell's vault dweller Lucy and Aaron Moten's Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus.</p>

<p>The Burning Springs update adds an arid and charred region to post-nuclear Ohio, and will include new factions, challenges, and unique weapons, gear, and fish, alongside those Bounty Hunting missions.</p>
<p>There's also an intelligent Super Mutant called the Rust King, as well as a "wild local menace" called the Rad Hog you can tame and keep as a pet.</p>
<p>The Ghoul will be located at The Last Resort in Highway Town, but won't be a playable character or companion.</p>

<p>Still, it's a nice nod to the TV series in the main game series. It proved especially popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Besides contributing to a bump in popularity for the games too, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">third season of Fallout has already been announced</a> before the second has even been released.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-was-shipped-to-some-users-over-two-weeks-early.1313533/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are out later this month on October 16, 2025. Unless you're the person who got yours more than two weeks early thanks to Amazon France shipping it out way ahead of release.</p>



<p>At least, that's what seems to have happened in the photo shared by The Verge's Tom Warren now that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1num2ad/quick_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">original post was deleted from Reddit</a>.</p>







<p>It's not exactly the best start for ASUS and Xbox regarding the rollout of this device, but it's at least exciting for user Technical_Fun77, whose post was caught before it was deleted, and also left their own user review of the device, which <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-has-already-shipped-to-some-lucky-gamers-and-the-first-review-is-in">The Shortcut</a> was able to catch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Technical_Fun77's user review of the ROG Xbox Ally X via The Shortcut.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Technical_Fun77 also isn't the only one who got their Xbox Ally X early, as another user (spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-amazon-france-release-two-weeks-early/">TheGamer</a>) shared they also received their new PC handheld from Amazon France over two weeks ahead of time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems that if you ordered your Xbox Ally X from Amazon France, it's worth keeping an eye on the order to see if it also is on its way to you ahead of time. Everyone else can simply hope and pray that their retailer made the same mistake, or just wait the remaining two weeks like the rest of us.</p>



<p>If you've not secured your own yet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">have the pocket change to dump $599 or $999 on either of the new handhelds</a>, then it's still worth trying your local retailers to see who still has one in stock. </p>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony launched an updated PlayStation 5 digital console in Europe, but instead of offering 1TB of storage for €499, it now comes with just an 825GB Solid-State Drive (SSD) at the same price, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-digital-only-ps5-now-comes-with-less-storage-in-europe-and-isnt-any-cheaper-to-buy">reported earlier by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. YouTuber Austin Evans discovered the change in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrxVnRxLo&amp;t=11s">a teardown video</a> posted earlier this week, confirming an earlier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770271/sony-rumor-says-it-will-reduce-ps5-slim-digital-edition-storage-space">report from gaming bargain hunter billbil-kun</a>.</p><p>Sony originally launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">slimmed-down version of the PS5</a> in 2023, coming with an upgraded 1TB SSD, as opposed to the original PS5’s 825GB of internal storage. At launch, the digital-only console cost $449.99 before Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand">raised the price</a> across the globe, bringing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">to $499.99 in the US</a> and €499.99 in Europe.</p><p>Though the refreshed PS5 says it comes with 825GB on the box, Evan found that the console only has 667.2GB of usable storage due to the operating system and other apps included with the console. Meanwhile, the older, digital-only version of the console with a 1TB SSD has 848GB of usable storage.</p><p>Aside from the storage change, the updated PS5 comes with a new matte finish, along with smaller components that make it about 100 grams lighter than its predecessor. Sony hasn’t provided a reason for the change, but its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">recent post</a> about raising prices cites a “challenging economic environment.” There’s still no word on whether this updated console will launch outside Europe.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789686/sony-digital-ps5-slim-less-storage-europe]]></content:encoded>

Amazon Luna head Jeff Gattis <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">announced in a blog post</a> on Wednesday that a “completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna” service will be relaunched later this year, introducing a Jackbox-like “GameNight” social category that allows Prime subscribers to play together with family and friends.</p><p>Like Jackbox, GameNight players can join games by scanning a QR code using their phone, which will then serve as the game controller. The feature will launch with more than 25 multiplayer titles, including <em>Angry Birds</em>, Draw &amp; Guess, Exploding Kittens, and adaptations of board games such as Taboo, Ticket to Ride, and Clue. Amazon is also developing exclusive games for the GameNight feature, starting with <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em>. This is a “human‑built, AI‑powered improv courtroom game,” according to Gattis, which requires players to defend themselves in court before Judge Snoop Dogg.</p><p>GameNight will be available to Prime subscribers at no additional cost, with additional games being added to the feature over time. Amazon hasn’t specified when this future Luna relaunch will roll out, but given we’re already in October, it should be sometime in the coming weeks.</p><p>Aside from gaining a new social gaming category, it’s difficult to tell how significant the upcoming Luna redesign will be. Gattis says that bringing Snoop Dogg to GameNight is “just the beginning,” and mentions vague plans around Amazon using AI to help reimagine cloud gaming. It’s unclear if these developments would be exclusive to Luna’s GameNight feature.</p><p>“With advances in AI and cloud technology, we see opportunities to create entirely new kinds of games – experiences that were never possible before,” said Gattis. “We have an incredible pipeline of games in the works and can’t wait for you to play and experience the all-new Luna for yourself later this year.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming]]></content:encoded>

              <p><i>Silent Hill</i> is ascendant once more. Following Bloober Team’s well-received remake of <i>Silent Hill 2</i> last year, the studio has confirmed that a remake of the series’ 1999 debut, <i>Silent Hill</i>, has entered full production.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent HIll f</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-confirms-silent-hill-1-remake-in-production-and-wont-rule-out-a-cronos-sequel-just-yet">As noted by <i>Eurogamer</i></a>, Bloober Team shared the news <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-babieno-prezes-karolina-nowak-wiceprezes-bloober-team-start-30-wrzesnia-o-godz-1100,797">during an investor call yesterday</a>. “We have two first-party production teams,” Bloober Team shared (via Google Translate), “one of which is working on the <i>Silent Hill 1 </i>project and the other has started work on the next project.” The studio also discussed its recently released horror title <i>Cronos: The New Dawn</i> which, much like the <i>Silent Hill 2</i> remake before it, has been received well.</p> <p>We’ve known about the <i>Silent Hill</i> remake since June of this year, when <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1933159748137828365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1933159748137828365%7Ctwgr%5Ef2a809ce836d796e0adb1769885c38dae3a3a4fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fthe-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">Konami teased the project</a> with the briefest of teasers featuring little more than some eerie, familiar music and the acknowledgement that the game was in development.</p> <p>While many fans of the classic survival horror series were skeptical about whether or not Bloober Team could deliver a quality <i>Silent Hill</i> experience, the team has proved the doubters wrong. And on top of that, the recently released <i>Silent HIll f</i>, developed by NeoBards, and the remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> show that Konami is doing what it needs to do to facilitate quality video games these days.</p> <p>A remake of the original <i>Silent Hill </i>brings with it many opportunities. Originally released in the late ‘90s, the game is certainly a product of its time with its awkward camera and…<a href="https://youtu.be/diknIjVTKxo">interesting localization</a>. Not to mention, it’s kinda tricky to get your hands on it. You either need an actual PSX copy and a machine that’ll run it, or you have to snag it on the otherworldly, hellish lagscape that is the PSN store on the PlayStation 3. Terrifying.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has announced Vantage Studios, which is a "creative house" at the company that will spearhead the development of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises.</p><p>This is the name of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">new subsidiary that Ubisoft and Tencent announced earlier this year</a>. It's being led by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, along with Christophe Derennes. Charlie Guillemot is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">aware of the nepotism concerns and said he just wants to get to work.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161" data-ratio="0.55928646379853" data-width="953" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161"></a><figcaption>The franchises that Vantage Studios is focusing on.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>"Vantage Studios will take on development and expansion of these brands, building on the foundation of Ubisoft's experience and expertise, sharing services and technical resources, all while giving developers more hands-on control over the games they are building," Ubisoft said.</p><p>The company added that Vantage Studios is Ubisoft's "first step" in the company's ongoing transformation efforts. There are also plans currently underway to make "additional creative houses" and a push to "group its brands and franchises under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise."</p><h2><strong>So, what does Vantage Studios do?</strong></h2><p>Vantage Studios, along with any future "creative houses" that may come, have the directive of being the teams to "facilitate stronger and deeper connections between developers and players."</p><p>"This streamlined approach allows for both a higher level of autonomy for developers and a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback, while still offering the benefit of Ubisoft's expertise, services, tools, and tech," the developer added.</p><p>Vantage Studios is comprised of teams working on the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises for its teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p><p>Finally, Ubisoft said people should "keep your eyes peeled for future announcements."</p><h2><strong>How Ubisoft got here</strong></h2><p>Ubisoft was facing financial hardships and undertook cost-cutting efforts that included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a> The company was accused by some of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">"horribly managed,"</a> and reports emerged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA (now itself being acquired)</a> and Microsoft were among those said to be interested in acquiring some or all of Ubisoft prior to Tencent coming in with its offer.</p><p>In March 2025, Ubisoft announced a new "dedicated subsidiary" that is focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, with Tencent providing more than $1 billion to acquire a stake. Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options."</p>
