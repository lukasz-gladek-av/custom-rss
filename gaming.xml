			<p>The process of EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">going private and selling to a 'Consortium' of investors, which includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, has just crossed its first hurdle. As initially reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mamalgryks2m">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, EA's shareholders have voted to approve the sale of EA to the Consortium.</p>



<p>Now, the privatization sale has to be approved by government regulators, a process which, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-aims-to-close-activision-blizzard-acquisition-next-friday/">Microsoft's journey to acquiring Activision Blizzard King is any indication</a>, will take longer than a few months, considering that EA announced the sale back in September and shareholders have already approved it before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Particularly because after one major video game industry acquisition made government regulators around the world pay more attention to the industry, we could see EA's deal face more scrutiny from global regulators. There have <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">already been voices of concern from US senators</a> in letters to the Secretary of the Treasury over the deal, alleging that the sale could allow for "<em>the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>It's not just within the US that voices of concern over the deal are being raised. <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">CWA Canada is also asking Canada's competition regulators to scrutinize the deal closely</a>, with concerns shared for the Canadian developers EA employs at its Canadian-based studios, including Motive, EA Vancouver, and BioWare.</p>



<p>While the US senators' letter to the Secretary of the Treasury voiced concerns over foreign influence, CWA Canada's letter to the Canadian Competition Bureau shared more concerns about the job losses and layoffs that could result from the sale. </p>



<p>"<em>Relatedly, the transaction could lead to reductions in jobs in Canadian labor markets. EA has said publicly that the deal would not lead to “immediate” layoffs, but with the deal being financed with US$20 billion in debt, some analysts suggest layoffs are one of the key ways the company will seek to cut costs in order to service its massive debt. Layoffs could further consolidate and concentrate existing labor markets for video game workers in Canada. Our concerns are compounded by the company’s history of recent layoffs: EA has laid off over 1,700 workers since 2023</em>."</p>



<p>We're still a long way off from this deal going through; like the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard King deal, we'll likely be hearing about it for well over a year before it is finalized, if it does indeed end up happening.</p>



<p>If it doesn't go through, then we'll likely return to a status quo in the video game industry. If it does, then the Saudi Arabia PIF will own 93.4% of EA, with the other Consortium investors vying for the remaining 6.6%. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-usb-c-charging-station-250w-6-port-gets-a-surprise-christmas-price-drop-lowest-price-ever-this-holiday-season-2000655257</link>
            <guid>1390939</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="76" data-end="622">Running out of outlets is a familiar problem in homes, dorms, and offices alike. With phones, laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches all needing regular charging, it often feels like your devices are battling for the one free socket on the wall. Deciding whether to charge your phone or your laptop shouldn’t be a daily dilemma. While you could hunt down another outlet across the room, that solution is inconvenient and far from ideal. A better approach is using a powerful, multi-device charging station that can handle all of your stuff at once.</p>
<p data-start="624" data-end="1020">The Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is designed to solve this exact issue. Built to charge multiple devices quickly and efficiently, this high-capacity charging station eliminates the need to juggle plugs or carry around several bulky adapters. Even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">Normally priced at $170, it can now be purchased for just $100, representing a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="624" data-end="1020">Universal Compatibility</h2>
<p data-start="1022" data-end="1612">It works seamlessly with a wide range of devices, from Samsung smartphones and JBL earbuds to Apple Watches and MacBooks. The charging station includes multiple ports to accommodate different needs, featuring four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. When a single USB-C port is used on its own, it can deliver up to 140 watts of power. That’s enough to fully charge a smartphone at impressive speeds or quickly replenish larger devices. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can reach 50% battery in roughly 25 minutes starting from zero.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2031">One feature of note is its adjustable power delivery system. An integrated LED display shows exactly how much power each port is providing, giving users clear visibility into their charging setup. A smart control dial on the side allows you to manually prioritize specific ports, making it easy to redirect more power to a device that needs to charge quickly—perfect for last-minute phone top-offs before heading out.</p>


<p data-start="2033" data-end="2350">Beyond performance, the charger also helps reduce desk and workspace clutter. With multiple charging ports built directly into one compact unit, there’s no need for extra wall adapters or power bricks. Everything plugs into one centralized station, keeping your setup clean and organized without taking up much space.</p>
<p data-start="2352" data-end="2725">Safety is another area where Anker excels. The charger is equipped with ActiveShield 3.0 technology and meets the latest safety standards. This system monitors temperature 80 times per second—over six million checks per day—to prevent overheating and protect connected devices. It’s twice as responsive as the previous ActiveShield 2.0, offering even greater peace of mind.</p>
<p data-start="2727" data-end="2940" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is available at 41% off, dropping the price from $170 to just $100.</a> For anyone tired of outlet battles and slow charging speeds, this deal is hard to pass up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anime Final Quest Codes (December 2025)]]></title>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Final Quest monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including cash, draws and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Final Quest is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/">Roblox</a> action RPG where players take on story missions, fight enemies inspired by popular anime worlds, and build a powerful roster of characters. Instead of running a business or placing structures, players spend their time clearing stages, defeating enemies, and tackling bosses to unlock stronger fighters. Team composition matters heavily, as different characters bring unique skills and strengths to battles.</p>







<p>Progression in this Roblox game depends on resources earned through quest completion, daily activities, and special events. These materials are primarily used for character summons, enhancements, and evolutions that increase overall team power. While steady play rewards consistent progress, redeemable codes provide a shortcut by granting free currency and bonuses, allowing players to summon more characters and strengthen their lineup without sinking hours into repetitive grinding.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-anime-final-quest-codes">How To Get More Anime Final Quest Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Final Quest codes are most commonly shared through the game’s official Discord server, the Roblox game page, and occasionally on the developer’s social media channels. The Discord community is particularly active, with developers frequently posting new codes. Therefore, the best place to find new codes is the Anime Final Quest Discord. However, tracking all these platforms can be challenging, especially since there’s no alert system to notify players when codes expire.</p>



<p>Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest codes and removes expired ones promptly, ensuring you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>During a new interview, Bloober Team’s CEO revealed some minor details about their Nintendo-exclusive game, Project M. </p>



<p>Bloober Team’s CEO discussed several topics, including bringing Cronos: The New Dawn to Nintendo Switch 2, considering the possibility of their other games coming to the new console, and more. He also revealed that the mysterious Project M is only possible on Nintendo hardware. </p>



<h2 id="h-project-m-has-a-twist-that-no-horror-game-has-explored-yet">Project M has a Twist that No Horror Game has Explored Yet</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/bloober-team-nintendo-switch-2-interview-ports-ue5-remake-ceo-piotr-babieno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Insider</a>, Bloober Team’s CEO, Piotr Babieno, was asked what players should expect from the Nintendo-exclusive horror game, Project M. Babieno responded, stating that it is very tough for him “not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it.” However, the developers are confident that they will be able to share the first details “very soon”. </p>



<p>Babieno provided some additional details before wrapping up the Project M topic. The CEO revealed that fans of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Limbo, and Eternal Darkness will feel immediately at home with this game. Project M will introduce “a bold twist,” which is something that “no horror game has explored before.” Lastly, the “vision” for this game “could only exist on Nintendo hardware”, concluded the Bloober CEO. </p>



<p>In other news, Cronos: The New Dawn will receive an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-a-new-difficulty-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easier difficulty option</a> in early 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, GTA 6 may still be a while away, but that gives us plenty of time to go back and replay all of those Rockstar games we’ve loved from the past, or even check out some that we may have missed. But which parts of the famed Grand Theft Auto developers’ library should you prioritise first? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we’ve gone ahead and ranked our favourite Rockstar games. From school-yard antics to tragic tales on the American frontier, here are the 10 best Rockstar games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Manhunt</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/manhunt-1764780304845.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For a studio that’s no stranger to causing controversy due to the contents of its games,  arguably none of Rockstar’s negative press surrounding GTA has come close to the furore that followed Manhunt. A stealth-action horror game in which you play as a death row inmate forced into partaking in a series of snuff films for the disembodied voice of a pre-Succession Brian Cox, it maybe shouldn’t have been a surprise that it garnered horrified reactions from the mainstream media, resulting in it being banned in several countries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the controversy only tells half of the story, because Manhunt is a good game, and a singular one in Rockstar’s library (although we don’t talk about its inferior sequel). A disturbing satire of the USA’s fascination with violence, it's undeniably gnarly, but smartly psychological in its approach. Linear hallways create a very specific kind of tension that so many of the studio’s other works simply can’t due to their open-world nature. The result is tight, focused, and brutal action that works to horrifying effect. Well over 20 years old now, Manhunt has stuck long in the memory… although maybe that’s mostly due to how its stark box art staring out from store shelves scared the absolute crap out of me as a child. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. GTA 3</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-3-1764780346882.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Very few games have charted the future of game development quite like Grand Theft Auto 3. The open world of Liberty City plays host to a twisting story of gang warfare, drug running, and betrayal in the series' first 3D entry. To say it broke new ground is an understatement, and the additional dimension and shift to a street-level camera is only the start of it. The PlayStation 2 had seen nothing of the like in terms of an immersive city sandbox full of opportunity. Its bounty of side missions and minigames blended with a main story that allowed for Rockstar to flex its storytelling chops like never before, telling the tale of Claude’s search for the truth through a cinematic lens and an all-star cast to match the story’s mob movie-inspired ambition (The Sopranos alumni Frank Vincent and Joe Pantoliano included). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 3’s slice of fictional New York may seem like a small map to wander around in these days, but gradually unlocking its three islands, each with its own East Coast flavouring, felt like a miracle at the time. Yes, the repetitive, simplistic mission design and less-than-desirable vehicle handling may not have aged anything close to gracefully since its 2001 launch, but an engaging story and compelling (if archetypal) characters are still there to be seen. It’s still worth playing today to see where the roots of what GTA (and a dozen other open-world games) sprouted from.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Bully</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/bully-1764780403659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully has often been described as “GTA, but in a school”, and to an extent, that’s exactly what it is. By substituting shotguns for slingshots and muscle cars for go-karts, it hits the right spot for anyone looking to wreak havoc at a private New England boarding school instead of running drugs across a fictional Miami or Los Angeles. The source of that havoc is Jimmy Hopkins, a troubled 15-year-old with a history of educational expulsions. Tasked with navigating a year at Bullworth Academy, a variety of classroom minigames, various clique quests, and hallway politics all serve to tell Bully’s story – one full of teenage charm and typical Rockstar social commentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skating or cycling around the academy and its suburban surroundings is a delight, with memorable landmarks like a colourful funfair or the looming Happy Volts Asylum filling a sizable map that changes mood with the seasons as the story unfolds. This world is the result of Rockstar adapting the GTA formula for an unfamiliar, unconventional setting – look a little closer, and you’ll see well-worn mechanics twisted to fit school life (for example, attending lessons late risks the fury of teachers and prefects, which is Bully’s version of the Wanted system). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully is admittedly a little janky to play today, thanks to a less-than-robust camera and over-reliance on quicktime events, but it's still a very fun time. And maybe if we’re really lucky, when Rockstar is done with GTA 6, we’ll get that sequel we’ve all wanted for almost 20 years now. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. GTA 4</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-4-1764780551132.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a strong argument for Niko Bellic being the strongest of all the GTA protagonists – something I’d likely agree with. Whether all of GTA 4 stands as tall around him is up for further debate. 2008’s return to Liberty City took on the surprisingly bleak issues of the American Dream and what it means to be an immigrant in the modern Western world. It’s a story that delivers for the most part, providing a surprising amount of mature depth for a studio whose tales have historically been approached from a more pulpy angle. The city itself was a revelation for the time, packing a varied amount of detailed sights and sounds, even if in hindsight its visuals replicate the brown-grey blur that so many games from the Xbox 360 era suffer from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in objective design and general gameplay that GTA 4 is let down, though, which, for the most part, is a lot of driving people from A to B and assassinating single targets. Well, aside from the fantastic Three Leaf Clover bank heist mission, that is, which would go on to inspire the central hook of GTA 5. There’s no denying the longevity of Niko as a character, though, and the very real, grounded struggles he battles throughout his story. We certainly understand why he’d really rather go bowling with his cousin…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. GTA Vice City</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/vice-city-1764780588552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few video game locations as iconic as Vice City. Its neon-drenched roads, soundtracked by an all-timer collection of ‘80s hits, served as the setting for many people’s core memories of the PS2. Rockstar’s time-traveling trip back to the 1980s is anchored by protagonist Tommy Vercetti, played fantastically by Goodfellas’ Ray Liotta. Released only a year after the game-changing GTA 3, it’s remarkable how much of a step up Vice City achieved in just 12 months, not just in its star-studded cast and characterful storytelling, but also in the way its design injected life into every corner of its proxy Miami. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An engaging story filled with Scarface parallels brought with it a new sense of excess, which lent a blockbuster style to a series that was, in many ways, still finding its feet. Those early days are evident in the relatively shonky controls and dated mission design –  during the campaign’s twilight hours, your attempts to wrestle control of businesses and balance money-making plates across the city don’t quite support the more ballistic ambition of the story. That doesn’t take away from Vice City’s overall charm, though; it remains a landmark piece of Rockstar history. And we can’t wait to go back to those beaches and clubs next year in GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Max Payne 3</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/max-payne-3-1764780695224.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar decided to take Max Payne in-house for its third entry, having published the first two Remedy-developed games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, leaving Max’s Finnish creatives behind resulted in an entirely different tone, but one that is equally as thrilling. Gone are the pulpy comic book panels, melodramatic monologues, and moonlit greys of neo-noir New York, replaced by sensory overload thanks to blinding sunlight, dancefloor bullet ballets, and a now-synonymous soundtrack composed by Health. Building on the bullet-time foundations that propelled the series to success in a post-Matrix world, Max Payne 3 transports the tortured ex-NYPD officer to Brazil in the midst of a gritty gang war that leads to a larger conspiracy that’s bleaker than anything Sam Lake would have cooked up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to target societal ills reflects the difference between Rockstar and Remedy as developers – the former is always willing to take swipes at nations and their ingrained domestic problems, whereas the latter looks inwards for more cerebral tales of individual struggle. Both are valid, and both work in the world of Max Payne, which means all three entries are fantastic in their own way. They all share one thing in common, however: that unrivalled power trip of triggering that bullet time, leaping backwards through the air, and raining dual Uzi fire down on anyone standing in your way. Delicious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. GTA San Andreas</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/san-andreas-1764780732818.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If the jump between GTA 3 and Vice City was big, then the chasm between Vice City and San Andreas requires industrial machinery to measure. In just two years, Rockstar had taken all of its previous Grand Theft Auto learnings, plus several huge swings, and blended them all together to concoct its first version of California. This vast (at least by PS2 standards) state is home to multiple cities that steadily unlock as you progress through its story. The road trip between them conveys a great sense of scale, as does the incredibly varied mission design and extensive cast of characters you meet during your tenures in each metropolis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It isn’t just the sheer size that’s impressive, but also the gambles Rockstar took when it came to gameplay. San Andreas features elements pilfered from the RPG and life-sim genres, allowing you to sculpt your character and customise their appearance, adjusting their physique depending on how many weights you lift or Cluckin’ Bell buckets you feast on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, of course, there’s CJ himself, a protagonist who lives on beyond the meme that follows him like a shadow. Authentically brought to life by rapper Young Maylay, his story is one of redemption and survival that pits him against some of the series' most memorable adversaries, chief among them being Samuel L. Jackson’s despicable Officer Tenpenny. It all comes together to make one of Rockstar’s greatest games, and the best GTA of the PS2 era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Red Dead Redemption</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/red-dead-1764780819709.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar had been displaying cinematic ambitions for many years before Red Dead Redemption’s arrival in 2010, so it was only natural that it would one day tackle one of the most fundamentally filmic of genres: the western. Taking heavy influence from the likes of The Wild Bunch, Red Dead’s cross-continent tale of an outlaw coming to terms with being the last of his kind takes fan-favourite John Marston to Mexico and back as he hunts down his former mentor, Dutch Van Der Linde. It’s a more rural setting than we’d previously come to expect from a Rockstar open-world, allowing for those cinematic flourishes to take hold and present an impressive artistic achievement. Bustling city streets made way for dusty canyons, and a stunning Woody Jackson score filled the space once dominated by constant radio chatter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption’s slower pace allows for the story to play out elegantly, with Marston’s near-invisible foe hanging menacingly in the background, patiently awaiting their memorable snow-covered face-off. Then there’s the ending, which I’d never spoil here for those who’ve never had a chance to witness it, but safe to say it's lived long in the memory as one of video games’ most impactful finales in the 15 years since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The road to that point is paved by some admittedly fairly routine mission design and a lot of horse riding, but there’s still enough personality in its dead-eye shooting system and endlessly fun minigames (liar’s dice, here’s looking at you) to allow for Red Dead Redemption to age very gracefully. It lives on as one of Rockstar’s three finest achievements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. GTA 5</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/gta-5-1764780856019.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 5 is a blockbuster in every sense of the word. Not just because of the colossal number of copies it’s sold, nor the amount of money it cost to make, but because of every aspect of its design. It wears excess proudly on its sleeve, reflected in the drive for money displayed by each of its three protagonists. This greed – itself Rockstar’s clearest criticism of capitalism and the obnoxious characters it produces – comes to a head in GTA 5’s signature heist missions, each a series of audacious action set pieces battling to upstage one another. These campaign highpoints blend in seamlessly with a Los Santos map bustling with life and teeming with charm – Rockstar’s signature humour oozes out of every sight and sound, from street corner billboards to radio station ramblings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sandbox has kept fans entertained ever since its construction in 2013, and thanks to the addition of GTA Online, it has expanded and improved consistently to this day. It’s created a whole new ecosystem for players to live in, take on increasingly complex heists, and even build race tracks that stretch and loop into the sky. It truly is its own ridiculous beast. But while it may be that expansive multiplayer mode that led to GTA 5’s enormous success, it’s Michael, Franklin, and Trevor’s story that has proven to have the most staying power, at least for us. It’s the best that a Grand Theft Auto campaign has ever been, and that has us excited to see how Rockstar will try to top it with GTA 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Red Dead Redemption 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/red-dead-2-1764780956736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The culmination of all Rockstar’s work to date, Red Dead Redemption 2 took living, breathing video game worlds to the next level when it was released in 2018. The level of detail in its sprawling frontier is extraordinary, with every creature, both animal and human, reacting authentically to your every movement. This makes each interaction with these digital personalities feel astonishingly lifelike. This expertly crafted, turn-of-the-century western America is the stage for a whole host of memorable characters, both quirky and dangerous, but none stick in the mind as firmly as protagonist Arthur Morgan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His journey represents the peak of Rockstar storytelling, displaying a level of complexity and nuance simply not present in any of the studio’s other games. The Van Der Linde gang’s trials and tribulations lead to a memorable set of dangerous missions thanks to the increasing desperation of its leader, Dutch. It’s a tale laden with standout chapters – a turf war between the Gray and Braithwaite families leads up to a manor house siege, a blockbuster bank heist in the major city of Saint Denis leads to an unexpected sojourn to the island of Guarma, and tensions between the native Wapiti Indians and American Army lead to flame-soaked shootouts. It would be hard to pick a single favourite from that list. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a vast, epic tapestry steeped in cinematic style, and the best game Rockstar has given us yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>1390927</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is a multiplayer extraction adventure in which players scavenge the remnants of a devastated world. The main threat is Arc’s machines and, as developer Embark Studios puts it, “the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors.” But one Arc Raiders player, hell bent on killing relative newcomers, casuals, and those who have next to no loot or even none at all, has gone viral for killing others for sport — sparking a debate about what is and isn’t acceptable PvP behavior in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with a brief primer on how Arc Raiders works. You can play solo or in parties up to three, working as a team to progress through the game. However, other players are a constant threat, and while Arc Raiders’ explosive launch has seen a number of wholesome, viral clips of players coming together to help each other out, some players just want to watch the world burn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taylor "THump" Humphries, a retired American professional H1Z1 and Apex Legends player, who has taken it upon themselves to hunt down teams of players and kill them for, well, sport. In a clip viewed 4.8 million times so far on Twitter / X, THump kills a group of players, one of whom pleads: “we just started. I have nothing.” THump is then called “scum” and “a piece of s**t.” THump responds to say: “yeah, I killed every single one of you by the way.” He then laughs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">THump‘s post reads: “I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/ncHTgNMT1x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ncHTgNMT1x</a></p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The post sparked a strong reaction from a large group of players, some of whom hit out at THump‘s actions, some of whom backed him up. “I come from a place where PvP is not optional,” THump said. “It’s a way of life. You want optional PvP go play WoW.” Then: “couldn’t imagine spending my Friday night getting mad at a random streamer on the internet enough to comment under his tweet because he killed people in a PvP game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another toxic streamer,” one critic posted. “You should try helping them instead, it might make you feel good about yourself for a change.” Another said THump was demonstrating “psychotic behavior.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there's something uniquely anti-social about people whose only enjoyment in games is ruining the fun of nice and friendly people,” <a href="https://x.com/MizutamariVT/status/2002466141915246730" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said X / Twitter user Mizutamari</a>. “There was always a difference between people who trolled guys that were yelling slurs or slamming keyboards and people who only trolled guys that were friendly and seemed to try and keep a happy disposition.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the months since Arc Raiders’ release, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ovpbft/proper_pvp_etiquette/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sort of PvP etiquette has emerged</a>. If you encounter another player and have no intention to PvP, call out that you’re friendly. It’s considered <em>not cool</em> to say friendly and act friendly then shoot, but of course that does happen. In Arc Raiders, PvP is always on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, this griefing debate has been around for as long as competitive multiplayer games have existed, but Arc Raiders has certainly brought it back to the forefront. Who cares if you pretend to be friendly then shoot to kill? It’s a video game, right? “Your fellow human who trusted you cares,” suggested redditor ilmk9396.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a video game. You don't die in real life when your character dies,” countered MachinationMachine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's a real person on the other end spending real time and effort playing the game and they trust you not to steal that from them after you say you're friendly,” responded ilmk9396. “They let their guard down and then you take advantage of that like a coward. Be a man and shoot on sight if you want the loot.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, from MachinationMachine: “it's a competitive PvP videogame where you role-play as a ruthless post-apocalyptic raider. How is being honorable good role-playing?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so on, and so forth. But isn’t this exactly what Embark Studios had hoped would emerge from Arc Raiders? “In the end, only you decide what kind of Raider you are — and how far you’ll go to prevail,” reads the official blurb. Here, the developer is essentially handing over Arc Raiders to its community. Do what you feel is right, basically. The game is designed for tension. But is it designed for relentless PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game is designed for you to work together, as there's typically enough loot in the environment to go around so that everyone can rise up and you can have a good time together, with the occasional PvP,” iNteg suggested. “The second lobbies only become about PvP you lose most of your playerbase who wants to enjoy the other aspects of the game and not just PvP. Going in with a mindset that it's only about PvP takes the charm and fun out of the game completely and also ruins the experience, you lose any sort of potential magic that could have happened because oop, see person must rat and gun them down without an interaction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one isn’t going anywhere, and neither is THump. Undeterred by any potential backlash, he has doubled down on his playstyle, posting a similar clip with the comment: “love loading up Arc Raiders on Saturday night to show the blue-collar workforce of America what a real professional gamer looks like.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Love loading up Arc Raiders on Saturday night to show the blue-collar workforce of America what a real professional gamer looks like.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Atlus has released an update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with version 1.03 promising improved frame rate stability and a new docked performance mode.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms of Persona 3 Reload for its Switch 2 release surrounded the performance of the game on Nintendo’s new handheld. Targeting 30FPS made sense, but with both the game’s demo and the full release, fans and reviewers alike noted that there were frame rate drops.</p>


<p>Version 1.03 is the answer to this, and it promises to boost frame rate stability across both handheld and docked play at 30FPS. However, if you pop your Switch 2 into a dock to play on TV, then a new performance mode is available to target 60FPS, which is a pretty impressive jump up.</p>
<p>This update will also be rolled back to the demo of the game, to help give a new and correct impression of what performance will be like. That’s expected in the coming days, but Atlus had better hurry, because they’ve put the game on sale with a 15% discount on the eShop through 4th January, and people will certainly want to wait and see how it holds up now.</p>
<p>Here’s the brief patch notes for&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</li>
<li>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</li>
</ul>
<p>In our review of the Switch 2 release of Persona 3 Reload, Nic said, “Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.”</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Realistic Car Driving monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Realistic Car Driving puts you behind the wheel in an immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where your driving skills actually matter. Unlike arcade-style games, this simulator emphasizes authentic vehicle physics, challenging players to master realistic handling across diverse terrains and weather conditions. From city streets to off-road trails, each environment demands different techniques as you build your automotive collection. The game revolves around earning cash through various activities – winning races, completing time trials, and participating in driving challenges. </p>







<p>This currency is crucial for expanding your garage with vehicles ranging from everyday commuters to exotic supercars. What keeps players engaged is the depth of progression. Beyond simply acquiring vehicles, you’ll spend hours fine-tuning performance parts, adjusting suspension settings, and applying cosmetic modifications at the customization shops. Although cash is earned through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promo codes — developers regularly release codes that grant free cash so players can buy more expensive cars and accelerate their progression instead of grinding.&nbsp;</p>

The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server and the creator’s (Ferdi26) social media pages, where developers post updates and announcements regularly. Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events.</p>



<p>But if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops. Furthermore, the developers don’t announce expiration dates for codes, making it challenging to know how long each one will remain active. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developer, Sandfall Interactive, is not tempted to scale up after winning Game of the Year. </p>



<p>Sandall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ended up winning Game of the Year for 2025, and also ended up breaking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an all-time The Game Awards record</a>, which proves how much of a success the title was this year. However, the developers are not looking to expand things instantly, and will keeo things as is for the time being. </p>

<p>During a new interview with Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s director, Guillaume Broche, was asked whether their next project would become a “large-scale production”. Broche responded, stating, “No, I think it’s good to have limitations when you are creative,” and that it’s the “best way to be the best version of yourself.” </p>



<p>The director added that there is the potential to “scale up now” as the studio has “a lot more money”; however, “I would say it’s not tempting for us because even the management team and myself, we’d have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves.”</p>



<p>Broche continued, stating that the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 dev team loves “making games more than we love managing” and wants to continue working on games.&nbsp;These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again,” concluded Broche. </p>

            <p>Two of the lead Dispatch creators believe Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul wouldn't have agreed to be in the game had he realised how much work it would actually be.</p>
<p>Aaron Paul plays the central role of Robert in the game, the player character, so he features throughout. His acting commitment, then, was not slight.</p>
<p>"It was gruelling," narrative director Pierre Shorette told me recently. "We were worried he would never work with us again because it took so long. It's like water torture, a drip here and there. We'll call him after eight weeks of not speaking, like, 'Hey, we need you for four hours.' It's like, 'Fuck, I thought I was done with this.' We just had to keep bringing him back across two years because he's in basically the entire fucking game.</p>
<p>"I think if he knew what this was going to be," game director Nick Herman added, "he wouldn't have done it."</p>
<p>"He would have said no for sure," Shorette agreed. "For sure."</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">Dispatch studio AdHoc had been talking about getting Rahul Kohli to play Robert</a>. "But we had and have a cool casting director that had a great relationship with [Aaron Paul], and I think he did respond to the script," said Shorette. "He was feeling it." Aaron Paul had also been in dark animated comedy Bojack Horsemen, which has tonal similarities to Dispatch. "He responded to that aspect of the game," Shorette said. "Thank god too, because I don't know what this is without him at this point."</p><p>Shorette went on to reveal that he had actually spoken to Aaron Paul fairly recently, around the time Dispatch was released, in October/November time. "I was like, 'Hey dude, I feel empty. You're famous and successful - do you ever feel this way?' And he immediately called me. It was a cool big bro move."</p>
<p>It was during this conversation that Aaron Paul told Shorette that he'd been approached in France by people - fans - who'd played Dispatch and apparently loved his work in it. Aaron Paul has moved to France, by the way, according to Shorette. "And I think he got approached a couple times on the streets of Paris," Shorette said.</p>
<p>"That happens all the time [for him] but it's usually someone calling him 'bitch' across the street referencing Breaking Bad, obviously. People were hitting him up while the game was still coming out episodically like, 'Hey, love you in Dispatch,' And he was shocked that it reached France and that it kind of popped off."</p>
<p>"Think about how long he's been in the zeitgeist," Herman added. "People <em>only</em> walk up to him for Breaking Bad. For someone to come up and say, 'Hey, this video game that is coming out right now: I love you in it' - it just doesn't happen for him."</p><p>And remember it's just Aaron Paul's voice in the game, albeit his very recognisable voice - not his digital likeness or captured performance. "I think that's when it clicked for him, like, oh this is real," Herman said. "This is a thing that popped."</p>
<p>The ramifications of that success, of Aaron Paul being praised on the streets of Paris for his work in the game, are that he's much more likely to agree to be a part of whatever AdHoc does with Dispatch next which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">will probably be a Dispatch Season 2</a>. "I think probably, if we're being real, it kind of needed to do what it did for him to be interested in doing it again," Herman said, laughing.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been a studio-defining success for AdHoc, which had been struggling for several years to get the game signed and released. Eventually, a partnership with role-play mega-group - and now gaming brand - Critical Role paved the way, and the game quickly captured an audience and raced to 2m sales. Now AdHoc will need to decide what comes next for Dispatch while also making <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">a game based on the D&amp;D adventures of Critical Role</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-review/</link>
            <guid>1390882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Given how much I enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends Z–A</a> — more than most people, if some parts of the internet are to be believed — I was really looking forward to the Mega Dimension DLC. The good news is that the best bits of Z–A are still there, along with a bevy of Pokémon missing from the base game and a slew of brand-new Mega Evolutions to keep things interesting. The problem is that getting between the exciting new bits is a bit of a slog.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnzCyRyPugM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, what is this DLC in a nutshell? Basically, after the near-apocalyptic ending of the game, a young girl called Ansha shows up with her friend, Hoopa, and asks for your help making some donuts. Being the do-gooder that you are, you accept — it’s honestly not the weirdest request you’ve had since getting to Lumiose, so you set about getting the one missing ingredient you need. Events transpire and you wind up in Hyperspace Lumiose — a sterile-looking pocket dimension mirroring a small chunk of the city you have just come from.</p>


<p>The main difference between the real world and Hyperspace Lumiose, other than the very muted colour palette, is that the Pokémon here aren’t native to Lumiose. Oh, and they’re all over Lv100. Your first foray here sees you getting absolutely wrecked by a gang of over-levelled Mankeys.</p>


<p>If you’re not already at or around Lv100, you’re going to really struggle, and thus the grind begins. Your goal now is to research Hyperspace Lumiose, use donuts to open hyperspace rifts, jumping in and doing three of a limited pool of missions. Pick up 10 shiny items, destroy 5 floating Poké Balls, catch 3 Pokémon, etc. The kicker is that you have a very short mission timer based on the quality of the donut you used, meaning that you have to work fast to finish the randomly generated map.</p>
<p>Within each pocket you will find three different Pokémon, two of which you’re likely to have already, and the third being something unique to the DLC’s hyperspace Pokédex. Finding and catching these new Pokémon is, of course, exciting. It’s a little rough though that you fight them at over Lv100 and they’re reduced all the way back to Lv20 when you catch them. Sure, a lot of the thrill of Pokémon is in the chase, but when your Lv100 Feraligatr needs to use multiple attacks to take them down, you want to catch a Pokémon with some of its bulk remaining.</p>

<p>Do enough research and you unlock the boss fight — a brand new mega evolution to call your own. These fights can be incredibly tough. While it’s 3-on-1, rather than the 2-on-1 of the base game, you still have the mission timer, alongside the fact that these things hit like a truck (no surprise when you’re fighting a creature at Lv140). Sure, your donuts give you a temporary level boost, but you’re not going to be matching their level.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you run out of time you can simply pick up where you left off with zero penalty, removing the difficulty of the actual boss fight. It’s obvious why this is the case — the game is tough as nails in these fights — but to me it underscores that the developers knew how frustrating these could be.</p>
<p>Beat the boss and you unlock a new tier of pocket dimension, offering more Pokémon of higher difficulties, as you might expect having played the main game. Outside of this gameplay loop, what else does the DLC offer? There’s a string of new side missions using the new Pokémon you caught, but other than that, not much.</p>

<p>So… is Mega Dimension good? Honestly, it feels like it would have been post-game content a generation or two ago, rather than a paid DLC. We’re no strangers to the grind in the world of Pokémon, but I’m struggling to find a time when the struggle felt like such a chore.</p>
<p>The idea of randomly generated dungeons is cool, but we need a less intense timer and more variety (and colour) inside each one. Doing the same missions again and again in order to get to the next boss (and eventually the chance to try to find a Legendary Pokémon) gets a bit stale, pretty quickly. If you miss the chance to catch the Legendary, it’s worse still. The difficulty spike could also benefit from being toned down a notch.</p>

              <p>EA’s shareholders are clearly keen on a buy-out, no matter where the money comes from. The sale, that would see the 43-year-old company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">become majority owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF), could go ahead by the beginning of 2027 pending government approval, now that public investors have voted in favor of the deal. And government approval might not be <em>too</em> tricky, given Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner would also benefit from 1.1 percent of the deal.</p> <p>The full deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">will see EA become a private company</a>, 37 years after it originally went public, with ownership unevenly split between three groups. The vast majority—an enormous 93.4 percent—will be owned by the murderous regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman via Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. That will leave 5.5 percent going to Californian private equity firm Silver Lake, and 1.1 percent for Affinity Partners, Jared Kushner’s investment firm that is, well, primarily funded by Saudi Arabia. If completed, it would mean EA stockholders will receive an enormous $210 per share.</p>   <p>While this will make for a nice payday for shareholders (which obviously includes EA management), it will also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">leave EA saddled with $20 billion in debt</a> from paying off the ludicrously inflated share price, putting its credit rating in the sewers, and it’s hard to see how the company can sustain that.&nbsp;Then, of course, there’s the very significant matter of the company being almost entirely owned by a state that <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/">kills people for being gay or trans</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">murders</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/saudi-arabia-turki-al-jasser-executed">journalists</a>, and <a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia">denies women many basic rights</a>. EA employees obviously have good reason to be fearful, no matter how much the PIF may exist to whitewash the country’s actions, and there’s no way of knowing how the ownership might affect everything from basic company policy to what’s included in games.</p>

 <p>Given the precarious state in which this deal would leave an impossibly indebted EA, and the likely exodus of both those let go in attempt to combat crippling costs and those who leave in disgust, it seems extremely unlikely EA could survive in any recognizable form. While games like&nbsp;<em>FC26&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> are huge successes, they’re also massive investments for smaller returns when compared to the mobile slop that makes up more than half of the games industry’s $200 billion value.</p>

 <p>The deal will certainly face lengthy scrutiny around the world, just as we saw with Microsoft’s $67 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard King, although it could have a far easier ride in the U.S. While <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ftc-xbox-activision-congress-appeal-blizzard-1850638519">the FTC fought hard against the Microsoft deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/supreme-court-trump-power-ftc-slaughter">all bets are off under Trump,</a> and Kushner’s involvement could certainly help grease the wheels.</p>

 <p>From the shareholders’ perspective, however, EA is a company that’s stalled and lacked for enough big hits in recent years, and hasn’t looked likely to turn things around for a long while.

Big title after big title, a brand new console in the Switch 2, and a new GOTY contender almost every other week. It's been breathless, but not without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-it-bother-you-that-big-games-companies-are-using-genai">industry struggles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">mass layoffs</a>, cancellations, and closures.</p>
<p>Which is why now, more than ever, it's important to shout out those smaller titles, those games that go a little more under the radar in a jam-packed release calendar. And 2025 has been incredible for independent games and smaller studios, with many of the year's best titles coming from those corners. Some of those are part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our big Staff GOTY list</a>, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tvzgqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>But, as we've done for the past few years, we want to shine a light on some of the games we've played and loved, that came oh-so-close to making our Game of the Year list and still deserve attention. So here are our picks for the hidden gems that launched on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong> (and there's a poll at the end to pick your favourite).</p>
<p><em>NL staff key: Alana Hagues (AH), Jim Norman (JN), Ollie Reynolds (OR), PJ O'Reilly (PJ)</em></p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Team Ladybug does not miss, yet the developer's games are consistently overlooked, in my eyes. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_chimera">Blade Chimera</a> is once again adorned with the studio's signature beautiful pixel art visuals with a pure combat-focused adventure. It's Metroidvania, yes, but one with guns, swords, lasers, and other futuristic sci-fi weapons where fighting and movement are king. This isn't a game about secrets — it's a game about fun.</p>
<p>2025 has been a banner year for the Metroidvania genre, but Blade Chimera's early release this year shouldn't discount it from the conversation. It should be right up there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I had heard next to nothing about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet</a> before I accidentally stumbled across it on the Switch 2 eShop. This co-op-only adventure game sounded ripe for some GameChat goodness and, playing through it with site editor Gavin (my fellow space explorer), it proved to be just that.</p>
<p>There were neat two-screen puzzles and platforming challenges that led to some good laughs, but what surprised me the most was its screen-specific story beats, where each of us was left with important bits of information that the other didn’t know. It’s a fantastic conceit, one that threw up more than a few surprises for the big finale, and it made me want to play the whole thing all over again from the other perspective.</p>
<p>A Hazelight joint it ain’t, but it’s a great excuse to see GameChat in action. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was... (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Taisuke Kanasaki has been the art director on some beautiful cult classics over the years — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> have basically cemented him as a legend among DS fans — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was</a> can easily sit among these.</p>
<p>It's only an hour long, but Dear Me, I was is beautiful; a wordless story told with stunning rotoscoping that will make you think about life and art in new ways. It's simple, effective, and the tearjerker you should absolutely try if you love narrative-driven games or art. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Having been desperate to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> ever since its reveal in 2022, I'm so glad Necrosoft Games got it over the finish line in 2025. Sure, it might seem like a tactical RPG twist on <strong>Persona</strong> school-life elements, but it's actually a fair bit different from Atlus' series. And the gameplay isn't built around traditional stat building, instead feeling like a chain of puzzles you have to solve to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>It certainly helps that the cast is loud, proud, and incredibly out there, like a bunch of high-school weirdos that I would've hung out with growing up. Couple this with its love of classic Italian horror cinema, and Demonschool stands out among 2025's strategy RPGs. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>You are Eugene McQuacklin, a duck recovering from a bread addiction, who dons his fedora and trench coat to solve small-town crimes and fend off the ghosts of his recent divorce. If this isn’t a funny image to you, then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_the_ghost_of_glamping">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/duck_detective_-_the_secret_salami">its predecessor</a>, for that matter) will not be up your street; however, if that idea brought even the smallest smile to your face, then boy, do I have a recommendation for you.</p>
<p>It’s a little on the short side, and some of the ‘Deducktions’ are rather trial-and-error-y, but Ghost of Glamping is one of the cosiest, funniest mysteries that you will have tackled in a good long time. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I'll be honest, I never even considered the idea that a game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a> could work as a Metroidvania, but that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laika_aged_through_blood">Laika: Aged Through Blood</a> has accomplished with its BMX-inspired exploration gameplay.</p>
<p>Despite its colourful, cartoony visuals, Laika is a sombre experience that absolutely isn't intended for younger audiences. It's brutal, with graphic scenes of violence, potty-mouth protagonists, and punishing difficulty to boot. It's all worth it for that sublime soundtrack, though – you won't hear anything else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Monster-catching roguelites aren't exactly new, but what if they were utterly disgusting? That's a very reductive breakdown of what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> is, a messy game that's overstimulating with every second. You'll die multiple times without knowing what hit you, start again and try and figure out what you did wrong, only to do something else erroneous.</p>
<p>Morsels is a game about making a mess with a bunch of messy creatures. And it's about navigating through the mess, the visual noise. It's extremely compelling on that front alone — if it's your cup of tea. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As a top-down Zelda fan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>'s colourful energy and industrial world enchanted me on its first reveal. Pipistrello loves GBA sprite work and intricately-connected areas, with skills that you gradually unlock to reveal more and more of the map.</p>
<p>And it's that map that makes Pipistrello so good. I love a map that teases you, leaves a carrot dangling for you to come back and chomp when you have the right ability. And it helps that every ability Pippit gets feels useful in some way, whether it's for combat, exploration, or just <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Pocket Trap has made an excellent adventure here — which includes an actual in-game GBA-type machine — and I really hope more people pick the game up. - <em>AH</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Who thought we'd be putting Brace Yourself Games' latest title on a list like this? But here we are. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is a completely different take on the rhythmic action that made the Canadian developer famous. This time, it's <strong>Guitar Hero</strong> meets bullet hell. That means this isn't a gentle game, and you'll have to try and try again to defeat each enemy.</p>
<p>When you reach that higher plane and hit all of the notes perfectly, and dodge all of the attacks? That feeling is unmissable. And look, if you need a break, there's even a dash of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/rhythm_heaven">Rhythm Heaven</a> waiting in the form of minigames. Surely that alone should be enough to get all you Switch owners running to own this? - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> is one of those games that folk were telling me to play long before it landed on Switch, and in the end I was sort of glad I waited, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">through reviewing it</a> I got to sit down and properly engross myself in a game that people <em>should</em> really be talking about in the same breath as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>. It really is on that level of world and character-building.</p>
<p>And it's on that level in terms of your choices, and their ramifications for your playthrough, too. It's quite something, and the world here is as interesting as the mostly text-based shenanigans that play out. <em>"Mostly text-based? That sounds like it's for old nerds!"</em> Yes, mate, I get that, but the writing is exquisite, and the whole thing is set to a nerve-y time limit. It requires your best detective skills and the ability to hustle and think on your feet. It also never lets you paint any sort of full picture, so replays aplenty are inbound.</p>
<p>You do want to be a weird <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">Witcher</a> version of those lads from Revachol, right? - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> is the answer to the question, <em>'What if Paper Mario was a mascot platformer from the '90s instead of an RPG?'</em> Chatty and bursting with personality, Ruffy has its very own unique gimmick that is endlessly creative and clever: copying and pasting.</p>
<p>It really is that simple! But it opens up so many puzzle solutions and ideas that the developers cram into every area with glee. Pack in plenty of collectibles and you have a game that would feel right at home on the N64. There's even some rough edges, just like the good ol' days, but we love Ruffy all the more for them. Sometimes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I absolutely adore arcade-inspired games that demand perfection to achieve high scores and achievements, and that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shotgun_cop_man">Shotgun Cop Man</a> does. The premise is simple: rid each level of as many enemies as possible while you make your way to the end goal. The twist? Movement is completely tied to the kickback provided by your shotgun (and other weapons) when you fire it.</p>
<p>So while there's definitely a slight learning curve to begin with, Shotgun Cop Man is right up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> as a perfectly tuned platformer that feels unbelievably satisfying to master. It's also hilarious, too! <em>- OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sorry_were_closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> is a survival horror like no other. Swapping out dark, grimy environments for colourful backdrops, it boasts a plethora of incredibly well-realised characters and enemies while introducing an intriguing new form of combat in which you quite literally target the hearts of your foes.</p>
<p>Though I wouldn't necessarily say it's scary in the traditional sense, it's undeniably unsettling, with the juxtaposition of bright, vivid colours and horrific visuals conjuring up a sense of fear that few other games can manage. Better yet, there are optional tank controls for those who, like me, refuse to let the past die. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>As fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, there was no way we were going to skip <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, and what an excellent follow-up to a quirky, occultish puzzler. Antiques are the natural follow-up to plants, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, 2025 has been an amazing year for the puzzle genre, and Strange Antiquities is among the best. Yes, it takes the same cosy-ish premise of the original, swapping the green for the old, but it's just as weird — and occasionally sinister — as Horticulture. It's all about reading, studying, and paying attention to the weird and wonderful things you hear about in-game. And the overarching narrative is equally rewarding. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> looked made for Switch when it arrived on PC in May, and the port onto the hybrid five months later proved a great match. Turn-based tactical X Beat ‘em up isn’t a combination that I thought the industry had been crying out for, but good heavens, did Strange Scaffold use it to good effect!</p>
<p>Racking up combos in this table-top-looking world is some of the most satisfying tactical gameplay I've experienced all year. You will never have played a Turtles game quite like this one, and hey, that’s pretty tubular, bro! - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> is exactly how it sounds: you set up a tiny shop and you, well, sell books! It's the epitome of cosy, and the inclusion of real-life books with real authors lends a sense of authenticity to the otherwise quaint, picturesque presentation. Watching the numbers go up as you sell more and more books is so very satisfying, but it never feels like you're pressured to perform well.</p>
<p>If you're after something genuinely relaxing, then I urge you to give this one a shot. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I was really surprised by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a>. Though I expected an experience filled with weird, <strong>Twin Peaks</strong>-inspired goings on — which it certainly has — I didn't quite expect it to feel so relatable and emotional. It perfectly captures the slow, almost monotonous day-to-day experience of high school, but in a way that's constantly engaging with some truly beautiful pixel art visuals.</p>
<p>It's the type of game you'll complete, leave alone for a few years, then play through again once you've forgotten the story. Remarkable stuff. - <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>2025 is the year when I've fallen more out of love with being online than ever before. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> reminded me that things haven't always been this way. That things were good, and <em>can</em> still be good. The power of online communities, a shared love of video games, and love and acceptance over hate make Videoverse an essential, humanistic experience for anyone who loves games, writing, and who grew up in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>We had to wait a few years to get this on Switch, but I'm glad we finally got it. - <em>AH</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GTA 6 Will Cost $70 and Won’t Get Another Delay’, Ex Rockstar Animator Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/</link>
            <guid>1390861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's been a lot of discussion on whether <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> would price <strong>GTA 6</strong> at the regular $70-$80 range of most triple-A games or become the first title to break the scary <strong>$100</strong> threshold.</p>



<p>The debate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally sparked</a> by Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong>, who predicted in August that the developer would make this bold choice and get away with it due to the game's massive hype. We at Wccftech quickly sought the opinion of another analyst, <strong>Rhys Elliot</strong> from Alinea Analytics, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> that it would be a bad idea as it would limit the barrier of entry to GTA 6 Online, which, if GTA 5 is any measure, will over time become Rockstar's main revenue driver. The most likely scenario would see Rockstar offering an optional, higher-priced edition, just like most triple-A publishers do nowadays, while keeping the base edition at its regular price.</p>



<p>Now, former Rockstar animator Mike York revealed a similar outlook in an interview <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Esports Insider</a>. </p>



<p><em>I don't think the price tag for GTA 6 will be $100. I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don't think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They'll sell so many copies of the game that they won't need to be greedy and charge $100. They don't need to leave that sour taste in people's mouths if they don't have to, so I don't think they'll do that.</em> <em>It might have a $99 day-one version if you pre-order it, where it gives you a huge bundle when GTA Online comes out. You have your own apartment or something like that. But the base game will be $70.</em></p>



<p>The other big question mark on the game pertains to its launch date. It has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed twice</a>, after all, and fans are really worried there might be a third time. York, however, isn't concerned:</p>



<p><em>I think the game will be released in November 2026, as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games, then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually, companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time</em>.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled to launch on November 15, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <guid>1390837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report reveals that the director of ‘Chernobyl’ is being brought on to helm the upcoming Netflix Assassin’s Creed series.</p>



<p>Things have been progressing rather quickly for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series lately. Just last month, players were informed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toby Wallace from Euphoria</a> has been cast as the lead in the show. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> in November that spoke about the setting of the upcoming series. Now we know who will direct the show, and Netflix has locked in a major name. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-is-centered-on-a-secret-war-between-two-shadowy-factions">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series is ‘Centered on a Secret War Between Two Shadowy Factions’</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reveals that Johan Renck, the Swedish director behind HBO’s highly rated ‘Chernobyl’ series, will be at the helm for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed. Renck has also directed series like ‘The Last Panther’ and episodes of popular shows like ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘Vikings,’ ‘Bates Motel’ and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, Roberto Patino and David Wiener will be the creators, showrunners, and executive producers for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed adaptation. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Matt O’Toole, and Genevieve Jones of Ubisoft Film &amp; Television will be coming on as executive producers. </p>



<p>The plot of the upcoming adaptation hasn’t been revealed, but we do have some idea now, thanks to the logline. It states that the series will focus on a secret war between two shadowy factions. One of these factions is “set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” We all know which two factions the series has always revolved around. ‘</p>



<p>Additionally, the logline also says that Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series will follow the characters “across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity’s destiny.” </p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on the PEGI ratings</a> site. Additionally, future games in the series will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-will-feature-more-parkour-possibly-dual-protagonists-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more parkour and potentially dual protagonists</a> again.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans are starting to suspect that generative AI cosmetics have been added to Battlefield 6, in spite of previous statements by senior EA staff stating that wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>This controversy stems from a player card sticker included in the Battlefield 6 Windchill Bundle, a package of cosmetics offered this festive season to players of the military FPS. One sticker, called Winter Warning, features an assault rifle with a snowflake background. This assault rifle seems to be quite the futuristic weapon indeed, as it has two barrels attached. Double the fire rate, surely?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">This was spotted by user Willcario on Reddit</a>, who titled their post 'Remove this AI s**t from the store', writing: "Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them".</p>

</figure>
<p>This led to a bit of holiday investigation from Battlefield 6 players, who went back through the library of similar cosmetics to try and find additional examples of AI use. There's no smoking gun here, but some did point to another sticker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">featuring a bear with ten claws as a possible naughty bit of technological tomfoolery</a>. On one paw the bear has four claws, whereas the other paw has five. A bit of perspective magic at work, or the shadow of Sam Altman casting an evil spell on EA? Who can say.</p><p>What's interesting though is that previous statements by senior staff at EA have outright crossed out the possibility of generative AI assets showing up in Battlefield 6. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">In an interview with BBC News Night</a>, VP general manager at EA DICE Rebecka Coutaz stated that while generative AI was "very seducing" to use, it would only be used in the proprietary stages of game development to " allow more time and more space to be creative". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">A similar sentiment to Larian's CEO earlier this month</a>, who also got hit by plenty of backlash.</p>
<p>So is this a case where temporary AI assets slipped in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">has there been a change in AI strategy in the months following EA's move to privatisation</a>, or is this a simple case of artist error. Sometimes I still write in Americanised spelling, so maybe an artist could be on autopilot and draw two barrels on a gun? We don't know.</p>
<p>EA nor any of the Battlefield Studios have responded to these accusations as of writing.</p>

			<p>PlayStation and security: a match made in hell. Following the major PlayStation Network crash of 2011, which brought the network down for 23 days, users often encountered various issues, including account security concerns and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/">prolonged downtime</a></strong><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/fbi-lizard-squad-investigated-ddos-attacks/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">, sometimes caused by DDoS attacks</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Judging from a new report, however, all these may pale in comparison to the possibility of an account being hacked, even with every security measure in place, including 2FA and passkey.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nicolas Lellouche</strong></a>, tech journalist at French publication Numerama, reported on X that their PlayStation Network account protected with a passkey has been hacked, as an unknown user was able to change the associated email and password, and even spend money from a linked payment method.</p>



<p>The story took a bizarre turn after Lellouche initially recovered the account through PlayStation Support, only for the hacker to seize control a second time. In an ironic twist, Lellouche spent the evening communicating with the hacker, who reportedly detailed how their method bypasses modern security measures.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>While Nicolas Lellouche has promised an in-depth follow-up to this story (which will be added to this post once it is live), he summarized what happened in a now-deleted message on X, which has been saved by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/french-tech-journalist-gets-their-psn-account-hacked-twice-in-a-row-while-having-passkey-and-2fa-and-exposes-a-security-breach-at-sony.1390756/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums member Arubedo</strong></a>. Reportedly, the hacker is taking advantage of a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a fatal security flaw with Sony's security systems"</em> to hack PlayStation Network accounts, requiring only the associated email address, as they are apparently using internal tools. This, if true, is likely the core of the issue, as knowing a public email address shouldn't normally constitute a security risk.</p>



<p>Ultimately, their account was targeted because a screenshot showing the email address associated with the account had been shared online in the past, and hackers are reportedly <em>"collecting screenshots of that type to take over accounts and making sure the owners never manage to get them back."</em></p>



<p>Without the follow-up report and a final confirmation of a potential massive issue, there's no way to know if all PlayStation Network accounts are genuinely at risk. For the time being, the basic security measures remain the best: avoid sharing personal information online and use prepaid cards whenever possible to make purchases on any digital store. Losing access to a digital library is bad, but having money stolen is considerably worse.</p>

              <p>If you’ve been looking for a premium pair of earbuds that offer impressive sound and a long-lasting battery without blowing your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">The latest Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are currently going for just $110 at Amazon, after the retailer took a massive 27% off their usual $150 price.</a> The offer applies to both the classic black and the stunning gray color options, but there’s a catch. The discount is only around for today. It ends at midnight, which means you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Additionally, you’re also getting a two-month free trial to Audible with your purchase, which adds even more value to the deal. We highly recommend placing your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Distinct Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This stylish pair of earbuds features a sleek blade design with newly redesigned round eartips that keep the buds securely in place. The lightweight frame makes it easy to wear them for long; perfect for never-ending commutes and extensive workout sessions. Samsung has packed these with a bigger 11mm dynamic speaker with rich bass and powerful sound that brings all your favorite music to life. You will be able to enjoy all those energy-packed tracks during the day, plus calming theme songs at night, to the fullest.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; active noise canceling and transparency mode. The ANC mode blocks all external background distractions to deliver an immersive listening experience. It’s great for when you want to block the outside world for a bit, such as when in a coffee shop or in a packed subway. The transparency mode, on the other hand, lets external sounds in while still delivering solid audio. It’s designed to keep you aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Catching up with friends on the go and taking work meetings will be just as easy, thanks to the added microphone and enhanced background noise reduction. These come together to isolate your sound from all that chatter and laughter in the background, ensuring you come through clearly on the other end. Gemini support also makes it easy to communicate with the smart assistant throughout the day without pulling your phone out. Just say something like, “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”, and you will have your answers within seconds.</p>



<p>Managing music and taking calls can be done right through the buds. A simple pinch lets you play audio, pause songs, and attend calls. Similarly, simply swiping the blade adjusts the volume. Another feature that deserves a mention is real-time translation, which converts spoken audio into your preferred language on the fly. Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 8.5 hours of listening with ANC off, and a total of 30 hours with the charging case. You can easily go a couple of days without worrying about plugging these in.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a great option for anyone looking to enjoy powerful sound, deep bass, stable battery life, and hands-free AI assistance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">This deal brings the total down to $110, which is nothing considering all the features the pair comes packed with.</a> Additionally, you’re getting a two-month free trial to Audible, which gets you instant access to a wide range of audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals.</p>
<p>Be sure to grab the discount sooner rather than later, as the deal is only going to be around for a few more hours.</p>

Every title that makes it to market is a miracle in itself. The product of hard-working creatives who continue to pour themselves into an industry that feels more hostile by the day.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you connect with a game, you're having a conversation with the people who made it.

Baby Steps offers nothing of the sort. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In fact, the punishing walking simulator actively tells players to avoid pursuing perceived goals. Do not spent hours climbing that crumbling tower. There is nothing at the top. No magical item. No life-altering vista. Nothing.

Eight squads become six. Six become four. Four become two. Until, finally, a victor emerges. The fast-paced tournament format works wonders in tandem with Battlefield 6's kinetic gameplay, which feels all the more intense in close quarters. Teams that fail to work together are quickly found out in modes that riff on classics like Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. it's a free-to-play affair that feels like a genuine steal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-10-events-that-defined-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 events that defined the year for game developers - 2025 Wrap-up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ghost of Yotei"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> (Sucker Punch Productions / PlayStation)</h2><p>Image via Sucker Punch</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I bounced off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when it launched in 2020.

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty’s First Nintendo Switch Title is ‘Nearly Done’, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-first-nintendo-switch-game-nearly-done/</link>
            <guid>1390798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In February 2023, Microsoft inked a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The deal was signed amidst Microsoft’s landmark acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but fast-forward to today, and the Nintendo space is still without a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>According to one insider, that might be about to change. In a recent claim posted to social media, it was suggested that Call of Duty is ‘a few months’ away from launching on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-switch">When is Call of Duty Coming to Switch?</h2>



<p>According to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the first Call of Duty ‘Switch version’ is set to land on the platform in ‘a few months’. Corden explained that the spanner in the works concerned the lack of developer kits for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a pretty public issue since <strong>before </strong>the console launched in June.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Corden didn’t explain which Call of Duty title is being ported to Nintendo Switch 2, leaving it up to fans to surmise what’s on the way. There’s a lengthy line-up to pick from. It could be Call of Duty Warzone, which would promote the fastest adoption on Nintendo Switch 2, or it could be a recent release like Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Fans aren’t too sure about Black Ops 7 being released on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If we were betting people, I think the safest wager would be in the Warzone stakes.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/">Sledgehammer Games started hiring</a> for developers with ‘AAA mobile or Nintendo Switch’ experience, which was telling enough.</p>







<p>What Call of Duty title do you think would do well on the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Do you need a new Pokémon T-shirt? Don't answer that. Could you be convinced to buy a new Pokémon T-shirt if a nice one popped up? Well, prepare yourselves, because trendy Japanese high street clothing company Uniqlo has announced a new Pokémon collab for 2026.</p>
<p>The range is scheduled to arrive late March, according to <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/eu-at/en/spl/ut/pok%C3%A9mon-ss26">the Uniqlo website</a>, and features seven unique designs - some for adults, some for kids (often differentiated by the base colour of the T-shirt). I think the standout adult design is a blue-ish Snorlax T-shirt with a sleepy character design on the left side of the chest, and the words "Snorlax woke up!" underneath it. Though there's a grey Gengar T-shirt with the character smiling wickedly in the middle of the chest that I can imagine going down well.</p>

<figcaption>Snorlax - cute! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Uniqlo / Game Freak / Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best kids' T-shirt, and I don't know why they don't do these in adult sizes, is a sunshine yellow (or Easter yellow - is that a real colour?) Pikachu design. Kids and adults both get a watercolour-style white T-shirt with cute little Bulbasaur, Charmeleon and Squirtle character designs across the middle and the words "I have only 3 left, but you can have one! Choose!" underneath. I think this is a quote from one of the games when you get your Pokémon at the beginning? It could even be the original Pokémon game. I am really stretching my Pokémon knowledge here.</p>

<p>Pokémon turns 30 years old next year - I'll look away while you turn to dust at that realisation - and the official celebration date is 27th February, apparently. But Pokémon arrived a few years later in the west, not touching down in the UK until 1999. I know this because I investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-pokemons-arrival-in-the-uk-changed-games-workshop-forever">the story of how Pokémon significantly upset Games Workshop's operations</a> when it did arrive. It's unlikely competition, I know, but it transformed the house of Warhammer's operations forever.</p>
<p>The Uniqlo adult T-Shirts are €19.90, and the kids' T-shirts are €12.90. Maybe see if you can squeeze into one of the smaller ones?</p>
<p>Uniqlo is no stranger to Pokémon collabs. Earlier this year it released an eye-catching and very, perhaps, knowing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-uniqlo-know-what-it-was-doing-with-this-pokemon-magikarp-t-shirt-slogan">Magikarp design that referenced the creature being an "expert splasher"</a>.</p>
<p>This year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Nintendo Switch - another of the in-between and slightly off-at-a-tangent Pokémon Switch instalments. It was a bit uneven but, overall, Chris Tapsell liked it. "Lumiose City could do with work, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pokémon's standards," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> fans will have a very Merry Christmas this year, as Sega will be launching the free 'NiGHTS DLC Pack' this week on Christmas Eve – that's <strong>24th December 2025</strong>, just to make it crystal clear.</p>
<p>The pack will include NiGHTS as a playable character, the Dream Sleeper vehicle, and new emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>The character originally appeared in <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/nights_into_dreams">NiGHTS into Dreams</a> for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The release of the DLC on Christmas Eve appears to be a direct nod to <strong>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams</strong>, a promotional sampler disc that released in the festive period of 1996.</p>
<p>There are even more free characters on the way too, with AiAi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball</a> expected to drop in January, followed by Tangle and Whisper in February.</p>
<p>If you've purchased the additional Season Pass, you can also enjoy characters such as Spongebob Squarepants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>'s Steve, with <strong>Pac-Man</strong> racers also expected in January.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for the Switch 2 version of CrossWorlds, we said that "Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects". High praise indeed. It's a good'un, folks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been just a little over seven years since <strong>Epic</strong> threw the gauntlet at <strong>Valve</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching its <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> as a direct competitor to the <strong>Steam</strong> platform</a> on PC. Right away, Epic tried to lure the game development community with a far more appealing revenue share split (88%-12% in favor of the developers, versus Steam's 70%-30%) and fans with a combination of exclusive games (which are more or less gone now, except for rare exceptions), free games and discounts (those <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are still very much happening</a>), and more.</p>



<p>At the end of 2025, we can safely say that Epic's massive efforts and expenses successfully carved a sizable user base for itself. Earlier this year, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the community had grown to host <strong>more than 295 million users</strong> in total. However, it did not impact Steam in the least; Valve's platform has continued to grow at an impressive pace, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent users</strong> two months ago</a>. That's users who were online at the same time, a figure that can be verified independently thanks to the existence of SteamDB. The same cannot be done with the EGS, but it is believed to be far lower. </p>



<p>Besides mere figures, though, core gamers still tend to be quite dismissive of Epic's Store, whereas they are really fond and protective of Steam, perhaps at times even more than they ought to be. Why? This specific question was answered by <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>. <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/epic-fails-to-compete-with-steam-because-egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-community-says-witchfire-lead-as-epic-has-nothing-to-do-but-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with FRVR</a>, he claimed that Valve's Steam feels more like a home thanks to its feature set, whereas the EGS is still merely a shop:</p>



<p><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop.</em></p>



<p><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community. There’s actually so much happening in that community hub for every single game, much more than I ever imagined, and it’s no wonder that people sort of get invested emotionally in Steam. And then they feel like, ‘Okay, my home is here, so my personal library is here’. So when something is released exclusively to Epic, something they want to play, then it’s a problem for them because now I’m gonna [have to] cheat on my home library with some other shop.</em></p>



<p>It's a fair explanation. While Epic has improved its store over time, introducing the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifting feature for Black Friday 2025</a> and, a few days ago, a cross-platform text chat, it still lacks the community features mentioned by Chmielarz. Overall, Epic's improvements to its platform have been too slow to catch up with Steam, especially since Valve hasn't rested on its laurels and continues to refine its own ecosystem. </p>



<p>It should be noted that The Astronauts actually did take the timed Epic Games Store exclusivity deal for Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as discussed in a previous exclusive interview with Wccftech</a>. The game eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a year later on Steam</a>. In the FRVR interview, Chmielarz stated that the company was running out of money, making the deal vital to keep the company independent. Ultimately, he claims everyone got what they wanted: Epic got an exclusive game for a year, The Astronauts got the money to keep afloat, and the Steam community got a more polished game, albeit a bit later.</p>

            <p>Vince Zampella, the co-creator of Call of Duty, founder of Respawn Entertainment, and head of EA's Battlefield franchise died in a car crash on December 22nd. He was 55 years old.</p>
<p>"We're heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella," Respawn Entertainment said in a statement on Twitter. "Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him."</p>

<p>Zampella's earliest credited work was as a producer at GameTek, but he rose to prominence when he joined 2015, Inc., working as development director on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The Second World War-set shooter made in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg was a huge success and EA attempted to bring the development team in-house. Instead of being absorbed by EA and working on the publisher's series, Zampella, and fellow developers Jason West and Grant Collier left 2015, Inc. and formed Infinity Ward.</p>
<p>Backed by Activision, <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/">the studio began work on a project with a less than subtle codename: 'Medal Of Honor Killer'</a>.</p>
<p>Released in 2003, just a year after Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Call of Duty was an immediate hit. Under Zampella, who worked as both a head of the studio and producer, the series continued to grow and the studio became a valuable cornerstone of Activision.</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> 2 in 2009, Activision fired Zampella and fellow Infinity Ward founder Jason West, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-decapitates-infinity-ward">citing breaches of contract</a>. Zampella and West sued Activision for unpaid royalties and following years of suit and countersuit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-fireworks-activision-infinity-ward-lawsuit-settled">the publisher settled with the founders in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>In that time, Zampella and West co-founded Respawn Entertainment with their old frenemy EA. Zampella remained with the studio until 2020, overseeing the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, and a return to Medal of Honor, with the VR title Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond.</p>
<p>In 2020, Zampella moved up within EA, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-ceo-vince-zampella-is-taking-over-dice-la">taking over the LA branch of DICE</a>. Then in 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-battlefield-is-a-return-to-the-peak-era-of-battlefields-3-and-4-with-a-modern-setting-and-smaller-headcounts">he took over the Battlefield series</a>. Under his leadership, the series has seen its largest launch to date and looks to be going toe-to-toe with Call of Duty in terms of player numbers.</p>
<p>To only look at a person's career is to inevitably capture only a small part of the impact they had on the world, it says nothing of their family and friends, but there are few parts of modern gaming that haven't been touched in some way by the games Zampella created – either in response to them or reaction to them. His loss will be felt by many.</p><p>"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work," <a href="https://x.com/EA/status/2003249476836966693">EA wrote in a statement</a>. "Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come."</p>
