			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en">annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, Square Enix released two new trailers for Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, providing new looks at the two HD-2D games launching this December and next year, respectively.</p>



<p>The Octopath Traveler 0 trailer, which can be watched below, provides a quick look at the game's story and setting, highlighting how players will return to the continent of Orsterra and witness a tale of beginnings. This tale will be made more engaging to experience with some new gameplay features never seen before in the series, like the ability to customize the main playable character, new town building mechanics, and enhanced turn-based combat where players will be able to bring eight characters at the same time, over the four that could be brought in the first two entries in the series.</p>

<p>While much different from Octopath Traveler 0, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales will have plenty to offer to fans of classic role-playing games besides the gorgeous HD-2D visuals. The new Tokyo Game Show trailer shared today provides a solid overview of the action-focused experience, which looks like a modern take on the classic top-down ARPG formula seen in older entries in The Legend of Zelda series.</p>

<p>Scheduled for release sometime in 2026, and with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">playable demo publicly available on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, I wasn't surprised that a more recent build of The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales wasn't available during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>. My disappointment, however, was made easier to bear by having the chance of testing out Octopath Traveler 0 before its launch on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch. Although my time with the game was short, preventing me from getting deeper into the town building mechanics, it was more than enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved/">appreciate some of the enhancements to the series formula</a>, especially the bigger combat party,. which are set to open a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p>

            <p>
My first game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-the-open">Lost In The Open</a> came to a sticky end in the borderlands, when my ragtag group of dog-eared bodyguards and hastily-recruited vagrants encountered the full flower of the Strathian military. Outnumbered, underlevelled and already bloodied, my warriors struggled to make a dent on the gleaming Strathian plate, and were swiftly surrounded and slaughtered. 
</p>
<p>
It was at this point that I realised I had fled too efficiently through the mountains and forests. I should have spent more time grinding bandits, looting old forges, and putting aside resources for the inevitable midboss encounter. I'm not sure I can be blamed for my haste, though. After all, I am a nearly-dead king, the survivor of an assassination attempt during a diplomatic dinner, and there is a whole army sweeping over the countryside behind me.

<p>
The work of Stockholm-based Black Voyage Games, Lost In The Open is a "low-fantasy" tactics RPG that combines the roguelike running-away of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> with something like the mood and art direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wildermyth">Wildermyth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banner-saga">The Banner Saga</a>. It casts you as King Nrvesk, known throughout the lands for being a total bastard, which is why somebody's just shoved a knife into him.

<p>
Starting out with a handful of surviving guards - two, on "Merciful" difficulty - you will flee north from the capital of Stratha, trying to reach your home realm of Ruedome before the Strathaian vanguard overtakes you in a sea of red hexagons. Each map node contains a battle, a resourcing opportunity, or a more ambiguous, perhaps multiple-part story quest. I met a nice noblewoman who wanted me to retrieve an heirloom from robbers, for example. I will leave you to discover whether I was unwise to accept.
</p><p>
Picking a fight in Lost In The Open can be very consequential. Units have a chance of dying permanently when KO'd, and even if they finish the fight upright, it'll take them a while to heal afterwards, consuming medical supplies in the process. Capital-i Injuries may become Marred, distorting the unit's stats, unless they are properly tended to. Needless to say, if King Nrvesk cops it, your run is over. 
</p>
<p>
You'll need to regularly risk battle, though, because it's vital to level up and gather scrap and gold for bartering and upgrades. Sooner or later, there will be a combat you can't avoid. You also need to make friends along the way - both recruiting soldiers, and forging alliances through quests that might pay dividends down the road.
</p>

<p>
The battle system itself is entertaining, if familiar. Characters act according to an initiative bar, and take more damage when attacked in the flanks or rear. Each unit has a degradeable armour layer that saves them from health loss, though some abilities can get around it. Warriors fall into such archetypes as crossbowmen who must spend action points to reload, tanky shieldbros who can absorb blows directed at adjacent friendlies, and screamy berserkers with power moves that deal extra damage based on how many foes have already been moidered. 
</p><p>
It doesn't seem as in-depth as the games I invoked in my intro, but I'm basing that observation on a cheeky 62 minutes with the Steam demo. The full game launches into early access on 26th September, with the first of three acts, plus "5 factions with 20 unit types (most are recruitable), 3 zones, 3 biomes, a wide variety of terrains, 6 boss encounters, and hundreds of unique events to discover." 
</p>
<p>
Among the things I'm curious about is whether King Nrvesk will have to mend his ways enroute to Ruedome - that "rue" is doing a lot of thematic heavy lifting here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2027380/Lost_In_The_Open/">The Steam page</a> suggests that "you must recruit strategically, fight desperately and repent sincerely", but perhaps I can "repent strategically", instead. I'm pretty sure Machiavelli has something to say about timely apologies?

              <p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is being patched to 1.3.0, and with the rounder number comes a more significant update. It introduces a new way to play online with friends, a bunch of improvements in Free Roam, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-1-2-0-three-lap-cpu-nerf-1851787286">yet again</a> halfway suggests it will boost the frequency with which you’ll encounter three-lap races, but still in frustratingly ambiguous language.</p> <p>Nintendo’s update notes for game patches are notoriously sparse. The most recent system update for the Switch 2 came with the legend, “General system stability improvements to enhance the user’s experience,” offering not a single extra detail. <em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s 1.1.2 patch notes were similarly a single sentence long. So 1.3.0’s detailed list is of some significance.</p> <p>So the headline here is you can now join your friends online when playing Knockout Tour, alongside regular Race and Battle modes. There’s another nice touch that if when trying to join friends for Knockout Tour, Race or Battle online and the game is full, you and one other person can play Free Roam together while you wait. That’s a lot better than staring at a queue.</p>

 <p>Talking of Free Roam, the new patch improves the map show it will finally show you the locations of P Switches you’ve already found, and the Peach Medallions you’ve previously claimed. Given how ubiquitous these are, and how (annoyingly) similar they can be, this’ll make it far easier to know if you’re just repeating yourself. Also, all those previously discovered P Switches will act as quick travel points, if a little unspecific—the notes say it’ll “move to a location near the P Switch.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to the actual racing itself, one key improvement is a slight speeding up of the replenishment rate of item boxes, meaning a new one will spawn in more quickly after the previous is nabbed by an opponent, along with an increase in your time spent invincible after being spun out or crashing.</p>

 <p>But most importantly, when playing “wireless” races there’s another increase to the frequency with which three-lap courses will appear. That was a common lament when the game was first released, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-1-2-0-three-lap-cpu-nerf-1851787286">first supposedly addressed in a patch at the end of July</a>, although this didn’t do much to ease people’s frustration, and many suspected didn’t actually affect online racing at all. Hopefully this latest tweak will make a more noticeable improvement, although it’s worth noting that yet again the patch notes speak only of “wireless” and not “online,” and no one knows if this is a deliberate distinction. God knows why Nintendo won’t just let it be a fixed toggle we can flip on—clearly <em>World</em>‘s new contiguous races have so enamored Nintendo that it isn’t able to let go of them properly, much to the ongoing frustration of players.</p> <p>The notes also come with changes to UFOs in Free Roam, and a bunch of fixes for some niche issues. We’re obviously still a fair way off the time when updates will include new and classic courses getting added, which is when things get much more interesting. You can read all the patch notes below:</p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can now join friends playing “Knockout Tour” by selecting “Friends” from “Online Play” “1p.”</li> <li>Up to 2 players can now play “Free Roam” while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing “Race,” “Knockout Tour” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>The “Free Roam” map now displays the locations of P Switches you’ve run over and Peach Medallions you’ve obtained. <ul> <li>You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In “Free Roam”, you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO. <ul> <li>If “Dash Food” in “Settings/Controller” is set to “Doesn’t transform” then you will not transform.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is now easier to encounter UFOs in “Free Roam.”</li> <li>The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in “Free Roam” have been adjusted.</li> <li>When spectating in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play”, you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con&nbsp;2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li> <li>Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived.</li> <li>Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race.</li> <li>Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li> <li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play.”</li> <li>Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in “Knockout Tour” in “Wireless Play” and “LAN Play.”</li> <li>Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in “VS Race” and wireless races.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue in “Online Play” and “Wireless Play” where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Grand Prix”, “Knockout Tour”, and “VS Race”, where the CPU’s ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Knockout Tour” in “Online Play” where other players’ ratings would sometimes appear as “0” on the results screen.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in “Wireless Play” or “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li> <li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Free Roam” where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during “Free Roam” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in “Sky-High Sundae.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from “Airship Fortress” to “Shy Guy Bazaar.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in “Bowser’s Castle.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Cheep Cheep Falls” where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Knockout Tour” “Spiny Rally” where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li> <li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li> </ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-steam-deck-native-version-brings-performance-improvements-in-act-3-new-video-highlights.1306374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The recently released Steam Deck native build of Baldur's Gate 3 introduces noticeable performance improvements where they matter most, although it is not possible to currently judge how much performance is improved with actual data due to benchmarking tools not being available with this build, according to a new video shared online.</p>



<p>The new video focused on the new build of the cRPG developed by Larian Studio and shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> highlights how the new native build of the game feels smoother in Act 3. This area is known to be extremely demanding and struggles to run smoothly on every platform, and the footage shown during the video definitely suggests that performance has indeed been improved in some capacity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to know how much performance is improved in the new build because benchmarking tools are unavailable without the Proton compatibility layer. This also prevents users from <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">enabling AMD FSR 4 for better image quality</a>, although Lossless Scaling appears to work even without the compatibility layer, so an upscaling option is still available those who want to enjoy the game with this build.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the most significant new addition, the native Steam Deck build is only one of the new features introduced in Baldur's Gate 3 by Hotfix #34. The other improvements and fixes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940?emclan=103582791464711919&amp;emgid=511843343389426278">outlined in the official update notes</a> are stability improvements on Xbox consoles, gameplay and audio fixes, and much more.</p>



<p>Considering how long Baldur's Gate 3 is, improving the Steam Deck handheld experience with a native build is highly welcome, allowing more users to experience one of the best cRPGs released in recent times. No matter the platform on which it is played, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game more than worthy of experiencing, in my opinion, thanks to an engaging story, a charming cast of characters, and deep role-playing game mechanics, which make for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">a great adaptation of the D&amp;D 5e ruleset</a>.</p>

                <p>It's a big week for gaming with events like the Tokyo Game Show, but right now, it's time for Sony to show what it has been cooking up with a new State of Play broadcast today, September 24. We've rounded up all the details for the livestream, popped in a few links for where to watch, when it starts, and what you can expect from it. On September 25, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-announced-for-september-25/1100-6534572/" data-ref-id="1100-6534572">you can also tune in for an Xbox livestream</a>, which will be held at a <em>very </em>early time.</p><h2>How to watch the State of Play</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enWyMpM0k4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>State of Play will be streamed live on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> channels and will be broadcast in English.</p><h2>State of Play start time</h2><p>The State of Play broadcast begins today, September 24, at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET and will run for approximately 35 minutes.</p><ul><li>2 PM PT</li><li>5 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CEST</li><li>6 AM JST (September 25)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Sony says that the event will feature reveals and news from developers around the world on third-party games and indie titles. On the first-party side, Sony has confirmed that there'll be an extended look at Housemarque's next game, Saros, with five minutes of PS5-captured gameplay. You can also look forward to updates from some of the teams at PlayStation Studios, but beyond that, Sony is keeping quiet on the specific details here.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2, so we're expecting to see a quick trailer for the game, and this would be a great time to reveal a few new characters for the upcoming superhero brawler from Arc System Works, Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Fans are also eager to see a fresh look at Insomniac's Wolverine game, which was first announced way back in 2021. It has also been a year since Uncharted developer Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, so an update on that game wouldn't be unwelcome.</p><p>If we're digging into rumored reveals, then there might be some pleasant surprises today. Speculation about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">new God of War game</a> that will be smaller in scope and will see players return to ancient Greece has been doing the rounds for a while now, and everything from a Metal Gear Solid 4 port to a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> have also been heavily rumored for a while now. The only way to find out will be to tune in today to see what the future of PlayStation looks like.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which now makes it easier to locate collectibles you've found in its open world.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Free Roam map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over, as well as Peach Medallions obtained. You can also now fast travel to P Switches.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Free Roam, it's now easier to encounter UFOs and the "conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions" have been adjusted.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a> Director's Cut is heading to current gen platforms in December, but existing owners won't get a free upgrade.</p>
<p>This Director's Cut was first released on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in June as a launch game, but RGG Studio has announced it will now be heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 8th December.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> will be coming to Switch 2 on 13th November, and then on 8th December will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam alongside Yakuza 0 Director's Cut.</p>

<p>Essentially, by the end of this year all three games will be available across all current gen consoles. Then, next year, Yakuza Kiwami 3 and its Dark Ties spin-off will be released, meaning the first four games in the series will be available.</p><p>However, there's a catch. Across the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015829">PlayStation Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-0-directors-cut/9nrkltwn2zq7">Xbox Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Steam</a>, there will be no free upgrade path from the original Yakuza 0 release to the Director's Cut. In addition, save data cannot be carried over to the new version.</p>
<p>Further, on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the Director's Cut version's Red Light Raid online multiplayer will be added in a post-launch update (the Steam version presumably will have it at launch). There's no release date yet for this update.</p>
<p>This multiplayer mode is a key addition for the Director's Cut, which sees players teaming up with friends to take down hordes of enemies. It's disappointing it won't be included at launch, plus <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Sega has confirmed</a> cross-play will not be supported, so you'll need to play with friends on the same platform.</p>
<p>The reveal followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">official unveiling of Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> earlier in the RGG Direct, which will come with a new prequel spin-off called Dark Ties. RGG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-next-game-stranger-than-heaven-still-a-long-way-off-as-teased-in-jazzy-behind-the-scenes-video">teased its next project, Stranger Than Heaven</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="HORI Wireless HORIPAD Turbo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a40167a4511b7/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer HORI has lifted the lid on its latest licensed Switch 2 controller, the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Wireless HORIPAD Turbo</a>. It's a colourful affair, with an overall design that looks uncannily close to Nintendo's official offering, but there are a couple of caveats that stop it from <em>quite</em> toppling the mighty Pro Controller.</p>
<p>But let's start with the positives. The Wireless HORIPAD Turbo boasts TMR sticks to reduce chances of the dreaded drift, full gyro control, mappable face and back buttons, a C Button, and a neat 'Button Lock' function to prevent you from accidentally hitting any of the middle buttons (+, -, Home and Screenshot) during particularly sweaty online matches. It also comes with its own HORI Button in the middle, which can be used for rapid inputs and setting up profile preferences.</p>
<p>A pretty appealing line-up, no? The black model cuts a very similar silhouette to Nintendo's Pro Controller (and is a drastic improvement over HORI's <a href="https://hori.co.uk/nsx-005/">wired counterpart</a>, if you ask us), but the Wireless Turbo offers a little bit of colour variation in its full lineup, with 'Aqua Cyan', 'Frost White', 'Shine Yellow' and 'Ruby Magenta' designs all available.</p>


<p>Naturally, this <em>isn't</em> a Pro Controller, so there are a few missing features in the Wireless Turbo if you're after a pad with the full range of Nintendo abilities. Like many third-party pads, this offering cannot be used to wake the Switch 2 from sleep, and there's no support for reading your amiibo. What's more, the Wireless Turbo doesn't contain an audio jack, and there's no HD Rumble either.</p>
<p>All that said, the Wireless HORIPAD Turbo <em>does</em> come at a cheaper price than the Pro Controller. The pad is currently listed on the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Japanese HORI website</a> for 7,980 yen (around £40 / $54), with a 'Winter 2025' release date. Of course, there's no guarantee that this price conversion will match the <em>actual</em> regional retail prices, but that's a good chunk cheaper than the £74.99 / $89.99 asking price for Nintendo's official offering.</p>
<p>The pad is now available to pre-order in Japan, so we can't imagine that a Western release will be far behind. If you want an even closer look at the colour range, you'll find HORI's 13-minute video rundown of the collection below.</p>

            <p>Whoops, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s release date has reportedly leaked via some swiftly pulled Amazon Japan listings. The apparent leak, which precedes a PlayStation State of Play showcase set for later today (September 24th), has also laid bare some deets as to what the game's swankier Treasure Box Edition includes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to these listings spotted by a Twitter user with the handle <a href="https://x.com/Renka_schedule/status/1970717557629047193">@renka_schedule</a> and reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">Gematsu</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> 3 will arrive on PC via Steam as of February 6, 2026. With the listings slating the PS5 version to drop that same day, that would mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/That'd%20mean%20no%20waiting%20for%20a%20PC%20release%20once">no extra waiting for us PC folks to get our hands on it</a>, which'd be a very nice surprise.</p>
<p>According to the listings, plumping for the Treasure Box edition of the game'll net you an art book, a copy of the soundtrack, a desk mat, and a Sunekosuri hairball key chain. The Sunekosuri, in case you've not brushed up on your Japanese Yokai recently, are "small, mischievous spirits from Okayama Prefecture" resembling either a dog or a cat.</p>
<p>"Sunekosuri run up behind people walking on dark, rainy nights," reads the description on Japanese spirit database  <a href="https://yokai.com/sunekosuri/?srsltid=AfmBOopopGblI7eHi5tYpfmqRPIy8NQmusm-Zl4mMq9mTwXVjOofASbN">Yokai.com</a>. "They rub against their shins, weave in and out of their legs, nuzzle against the knees, and otherwise make it difficult to walk. They do not intentionally cause any harm to humans, although occasionally their rubbing is strong enough to make a person stumble or even knock them down." Well, today's the day I've found out that my cat's an indoor Sunekosuri.</p><p>But I digress, the leak also looks to have revealed Nioh 3's box art early, so feast your eyes on that via the link to the Tweeter above, physical media buffs. Assuming the release date's accurate, you'll have about a week to finish Nioh 3 before jumping into the freshly announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, assuming you're planning on playing both on release. Or you could just be sensible and take your time, I guess.</p>
<p>Today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youtube.com/watch?v=0QcEoGC51ZY">PlayStation State of Play</a> kicks off at 10PM BST/5PM ET/2PM PT. We'll bring you any big PC-relevant news that comes out of it, and dutifully stick our fingers in our ears for the console-specific bits.</p>

Item boxes will now take slightly less time to refresh, also.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who do enjoy the game's open world, improvements have been made there, too. Nintendo has added the locations of previously-found P Switches and Peach Medallions to the map for easier tracking, and you can now warp to P Switches if you want to go replay them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest changes to the frequency of lap-based courses follow an earlier U-turn by Nintendo after it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">initially made it harder to encounter traditional three-lap Mario Kart tracks</a>.

Maybe Nintendo noticed?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other tweaks include the ability to join friends in Knockout Tour, and encounter UFOs more easily in Free Roam. Nintendo's full patch notes for the update, which brings the game to version 1.3.0, lie below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Ver. 1.3.0 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now join friends playing "Knockout Tour" by selecting "Friends" from "Online Play" "1p."</li><li>Up to 2 players can now play "Free Roam" while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing "Race," "Knockout Tour" or "Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>The "Free Roam" map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over and Peach Medallions you've obtained.<ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch.</li></ul></li><li>In "Free Roam", you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO.<ul data-cy="list"><li>If "Dash Food" in "Settings/Controller" is set to "Doesn’t transform" then you will not transform.</li></ul></li><li>It is now easier to encounter UFOs in "Free Roam."</li><li>The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in "Free Roam" have been adjusted.</li><li>When spectating in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li><li>Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived.</li><li>Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race.</li><li>Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play."</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in "Knockout Tour" in "Wireless Play" and "LAN Play."</li><li>Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in "VS Race" and wireless races.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue in "Online Play" and "Wireless Play" where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Grand Prix", "Knockout Tour", and "VS Race", where the CPU's ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" in "Online Play" where other players' ratings would sometimes appear as "0" on the results screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in "Wireless Play" or "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li><li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Free Roam" where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during "Free Roam" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in "Sky-High Sundae."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from "Airship Fortress" to "Shy Guy Bazaar."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in "Bowser’s Castle."</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Cheep Cheep Falls" where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" "Spiny Rally" where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li><li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Gearbox failed to share an updated release date in its announcement. Here's Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford's Borderlands 4 Nintendo Switch 2 release date announcement video, released in July.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">An important message regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4: <a href="https://t.co/Wc5MwAU2bm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Wc5MwAU2bm</a></p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The delay decision comes at a time when Gearbox is already working to fix performance issues with Borderlands 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. For example, last week the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. Digital Foundry has said its <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this in mind, it’s hard to imagine Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 running smoothly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Greetings, Vault Hunters,” Gearbox’s statement began. “We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio said that “in accordance with Nintendo’s policy,” all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. “We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a distinct lack of surprise at the announcement from fans. "The game has trouble on my 4080 super, I can’t imagine how the Switch version would fare," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfw57fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Bitemarkz</a>. "I dont expect the Switch 2 version to ever run well, but I do respect the decision to delay it to avoid a complete disaster of a launch," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfvdaln/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented jwhudexnls</a>. "BL4 brings top of the line desktop PCs to their knees, there's no way in hell whatever flavor of NVidia Tegra is inside the switch 2 can even launch the game," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfve8xk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added HoboG0blin</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a similar reaction over on social media. "Given how it performs now it would run at either 5 fps on the Switch 2 or turn into a Torgue device that explodes when attempting to run the game," said <a href="https://x.com/Raumentonus/status/1970625040996606256" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Raumentonus</a>. "Assumed as much, why did we push up the release date in general?" <a href="https://x.com/atomick/status/1970609381189525938" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered @atomick</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed.

                <p>On the RGG Summit livestream tonight, Sega announced , a ground-up remake of 2009's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-3/" data-ref-id="5000-37569">Yakuza 3</a>. As with the previous "Kiwami" remakes, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2, Kiwami 3 gives the game's visuals a massive upgrade, fleshes out story details with new cutscenes and action sequences, and also is set to offer a wealth of new side content.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA5Lec9jYuQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GA5Lec9jYuQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5_-kp17jCw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RGG Direct</a>, game director Ryosuke Horii elaborated on some of the game's additions. Besides additional story scenes, several of the cutscenes and voicelines from Yakuza 3 have been completely redone for Kiwami 3. The environments of Okinawa--a distinct feature of Yakuza 3--have also been completely remade. Combat sees similar revamps, with Kiryu being able to switch between his classic "Dragon of Dojima Kiwami" fighting skills and the all-new, Okinawan-martial-arts-inspired, weapon-heavy "Ryukyu Style." And to top it all off, the "Dragon Boost" powered-up mode gives Kiryu's hard-hitting, face-smashing, ruffian-hurling techniques even more of a ferocious edge.</p><p>All-new minigames were also showcased. A new game mode called "Life at Morning Glory" shows the softer side of Kiryu as he manages the Morning Glory orphanage and interacts with the children under his care. Another new mini-game, "Legendary Baddie: Bad Boy Dragon," sees Kiryu teaming up with a posse of female Okinawan biker gang members and helping them in their turf wars against rival groups.</p><p>Additionally, the game will feature a brand-new "Gaiden" story taking place just before the in-game events of Kiwami 3. This story, called Dark Ties, will focus on Yoshitaka Mine, Yakuza 3's primary antagonist. Mine will be a fully playable character in this story, allowing players to get a deeper look into the life and motivation of one of Yakuza 3's most endearing characters. This story will be part of the core Kiwami 3 package, and you will be able to choose whether to play the main story of Dark Ties upon starting the game.</p><p>Gameplay in Dark Ties is similar to that of Yakuza 3, and it focuses primarily on the familiar ground of Kamurocho. He fights with a mix of boxing-style techniques and acrobatic aerial strikes, and also has a powered-up "Dark Awakening" state he can enter into for increased brutality. The Dark Ties campaign features numerous mini-games and sub-stories, including "Kanda Damage Control"--where you attempt to launder the reputation of the notoriously noxious gangster Tsuyoshi Kanda, and the "Hell's Arena" underground coliseum.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvAQW8ObqM4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvAQW8ObqM4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Digital edition pre-orders <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have gone live on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/JP0177-PPSA30223_00-MAINGAME00000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Network</a>, where the game is listed as having a February 11, 2026 release date and a $59.99 price tag for the standard edition.

How we take Embracer forward across Fellowship? Our answer is a smart implementation of generative AI in ethical and sustainable ways," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We really do view AI as a strategic catalyst. It's the most powerful technology or tool of our generation for driving efficiency, amplifying creativity, and ultimately delivering the high-quality, memorable games that players demand more effectively, more predictably, and more profitably than before."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-employees-raise-alarm-about-chaos-and-mismanagement-at-probablymonsters" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former ProbablyMonsters workers raise alarm about mismanagement at studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Rogers said Embracer's development teams will always own the creative and final product, but that AI tools will "empower" its workforce to bring innovative titles to market faster than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This isn't a theoretical future," he added. "It's happening now and the results are quite compelling. Many of our studios have been experimenting with AI in the past couple of years and are now starting to really leverage it to eliminate bottlenecks and empower our development teams. We're beginning to see measurable increases in productivity."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To drive home that point, he claimed recent AI advancements from the likes of Nvidia are producing in-game animations that are "indistinguishable" from motion capture. "These animation tools reduce dependencies and production time for gameplay and cinematic animation. We're seeing a seven day mocap shoot cut in half." he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rogers explained AI tools are currently being leveraged by animators, designers, engineers, and asset creators within Embracer and said they have accelerated workflows across the board. He underlined the need for "tuning by human hand" when using those technologies, but said they provide developers with more time to "add their unique authorship."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hideo-kojima-partners-with-niantic-spatial-to-turn-the-world-into-his-canvas" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hideo Kojima partners with Niantic Spatial to turn the world into his canvas</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've seen great acceleration, turning days and weeks of preparation time into minutes and hours.

It's like electric or power tools you might use at home. Reducing repetitive tasks, and that 70 percent lift to make room for step two—and step two is innovation."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike&quot;">"We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Rogers claims AI tools will eliminate the need for busywork so developers have more time to find the fun. He also stressed that AI will never replace human authorship.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike, but we believe the greatest risk is not in using AI, but in using it without a strong ethical framework," he added. "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices. Developers want creative freedom to innovate and experiment and reduce iteration time so they can make more content. Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism. Intellectual properties need to be nurtured and respected.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is why our core principle is 'empower, never replace.' For us, ethics and good business are one and the same. They really do go hand in hand. Our position is clear: human authorship is final.

		<p>Jaw Drop Games has stated ahead of the early access release for its dinosaur horror game Deathground, that the operatives roster will be expanded by two more characters. These characters first appeared in the Kickstarter concept art and have proved popular enough that they have been deemed worthy to be hunted by dinosaurs. The two new operatives are The Observer Finn Voss and The Hunter Cooper Calloway.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is Deathground? | Dinosaur Survival Horror Game | Down-low with the devs!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs_z0zcy6Qg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Finn Voss is a former war correspondent and military photographer, and in Deathground she has a motion detector so danger can be detected before it finds you first. Cooper Calloway is an Australian hunter who specialises in hunting dangerous animals, so it is only right that he is armed with a rifle to take down the dinosaurs that are trying to make a meal out of the players. The dinosaurs will be a challenge to avoid as they will use all of their senses to stalk players, and they will not follow the same patterns across playthroughs.</p>
<p>Deathground will be entering Steam Early Access soon, with Jaw Drop Games saying it will be before the end of September.</p>

<p>While a remastered version of Yakuza 3 did hit Steam back in 2021, Kiwami 3 is a more in-depth face-lift, in line with the Kiwami treatments the first two games in the series have gotten. That means a full remake, with RGG promising "more intense battles, added cutscenes that bring depth to the story, and minigames chock-full of replay value" in addition to retooled visuals.</p><p>Here's a quick Steam page synopsis of Yakuza 3's plot, in case you need a refresher: "Kazuma Kiryu has earned his retirement on the sandy beaches of Okinawa. But when a deadly power struggle arrives on his doorstep, he’ll have to walk the streets of Kamurocho to escape his past for good."</p>
<p>The most newsworthy addition is definitely Dark Ties, a fresh spin-off adventure which puts you in the shoes of businessy Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine. If you hop into Dark Ties from the remake's main menu, you'll get to see how he established himself in the underworld after crashing out of the corporate one, forming deep bonds with Tojo Clan chairman Daigo Dojima and more typical Yakuza villain Tsuyoshi Kanda in the process.</p>
<p>It's been a few years since I played Yakuza 3, but I recall liking Mine as a change of pace from the brawnier brawlers Kiryu tends to have to wrest the clan away from, with his cold and calculating persona certainly being a lot different to direct predecessor and Yakuza 2 baddie Ryuji Goda. It's certainly nice to see RGG doing more with one of the villains from the Yakuzas 3 to 5 range, given those poor lads are generally pretty forgettable compared to series cornerstones like Goda and Akira Nishkiyama.</p>
<p>There's a deluxe edition of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties which comes with some extra goodies, while costing £69.99 in comparison to the base game's £54.99/$59.99/€59.99. I've mainly mentioned it because one of the additions is called the 'Legendary Lads Set', which is a very good name. It also features some flip phone customisation, though there regrettably don't look to be any embarrassing 2000s ringtones.</p>
<p>You can wishlist this refreshed street scum sweeper <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/">on Steam</a> right now.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-rebirth">Amnesia: Rebirth</a> developers Frictional are teasing what appears to be a new sci-fi game by way of a sneaky update to their deep sea <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> venture <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soma">Soma</a>. Whatever it is, it involves some godforsaken luxury hotel steeped in a sheeny corporate appropriation of sacred ideas about cyclical change - a hotel that promises "an out of this world experience". Sounds like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">the Dark Descenders</a> are getting into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> business.
</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday, the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/282140/view/542243094205040852?l=english">quietly patched</a> the decade-old Soma to fix "faulty spam filters" on protagonist Simon's PC, which you can surf briefly at the very start of the game. "Users may still receive suspicious correspondence due to treemail 0.1 filtering process issues," the changelog notes. Then, there's a line of illegible text.
</p>
<p>Dutifully firing up Soma and checking out Simon's inbox, we find a new message with the subject line: "[Virus Error] You've Ea%ned it". The email is addressed to [HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUAL], and is a garbled invitation to invest in something called "Hotel Samsara" (as helpfully deciphered by Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyVUDnIUON8">CheeseYen</a>). Hotel Samsara has <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">a website with a sign-up page</a>, and that website is hella creepy.
</p>
<figure>


</figure>
<p>"Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond," reads the About section. "Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing, Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious. In Samsara, wishes will come true. Interested in investing?" There is also a sinister animation of what appears to be the hotel lobby. It shows a circular golden wall decoration through shadowy, spiky ferns. My guess is that if you invest in Hotel Samsara, your dividends will take the form of dismemberment/mutation and a sense of cosmic despair.
</p><p>The page also includes endorsements of LuxuryNext, written by western-sounding executives from various trust funds and hospitality cartels. "Return on investment, time and time and time again. I really do wonder what their secret is?" writes Deborah RD Tory of Gilded Greens Group. There is mention of a man called Felix, who appears to be head of LuxuryNext. The quotes portray him as a "fearless" maverick and risk-taker. Sounds like obvious villain material to me. Bet he has a secret laboratory of some kind. Bet he has funny ideas about reincarnation. It's perhaps too easy to draw parallels with certain realworld billionaires who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump">made a portion of their megabucks from very expensive hotels</a>.
</p>
<p>As for "samsara" or "saṃsāra", I can say little beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">pointing you at the Wikipedia page</a>, which characterises it as a Sanskrit term for the "cyclicity of all life, matter, and existence". It suggests that the Hotel Samsara game will be another one of Frictional's spooky philosophical thought experiments. The website also includes what appears to be in-game imagery of a circular geometric pattern that resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">mandala</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavacakra">bhavachakra</a>.
</p>
<p>I spoke to one of Frictional's top brass at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last year. He mentioned that they had one or two unannounced projects on the boil, following the very good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>. Given that it was teased in Soma, the Hotel Samsara game is likely to be a sequel, but it could also be a new Amnesia game - Amnesia has explored connections between its debts from Lovecraft and real-world religious concepts and folklore, as in the djinn passages from Rebirth. With all that in mind, I'm a little worried about the game being an orientalising dog's dinner of ideas from Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, but I guess they've allowed for that by presenting it all as the queasy branding of a corporation in-game.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps we'll get a trailer in the course of Tokyo Game Show this week - or tonight's <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">surprise State Of Play broadcast from Sony</a>. In the meantime, there is probably more to glean or decipher from that website. Let me know if you stumble on any fresh details.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Oh look at that - the hotel website privacy policy redirects to <a href="https://kepler-interactive.com/pages/privacy-policy">Kepler Interactive</a>.</p>

            <p>Yakuza studio Ryu Ga Gotoku's next project, Stranger Than Heaven, was teased at its RGG Summit as part of the Tokyo Games Show.</p>
<p>Previously known as Project Century, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-project-century-gets-a-proper-name-and-a-stylish-new-trailer">Stranger Than Heaven was properly unveiled earlier this year</a> with a trailer revealing the name.</p>
<p>Now a further tease has been shown: the summit closed with a fresh look at the game alongside footage of the team working on the project. Check it out at the end of the stream below.</p>

<p>The footage shows a female jazz singer, also part of the previous reveal, but behind the scenes footage also includes glimpses of other areas of development.</p>
<p>It's not much to go on and somewhat proves the game is a way off yet. As per <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250618_Management_large_MTG_all_e.pdf">Sega's last financial report</a>, Stranger Than Heaven is expected to release in or beyond the company's next financial year ending March 2027.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the game, though its codename does suggest it'll take place in multiple time periods. At the least, the reveal trailer took place in 1943.</p>
<p>Also at the RGG Summit, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">officially revealed Yakuza Kiwami 3</a>, its latest remake.</p>

<p>Stefan was spending his summer playing Le Mans Ultimate, and said, <em>“All in all, first impressions of Le Mans Ultimate are a little mixed. It’s certainly disappointing that a 1.0 launch doesn’t come with any kind of championship or career, but the authentic recreation of WEC, the full field of cars (if you’ve got the DLC), and the solid VR support all make this enticing for motorsports fans – it feels destined to become a staple of the genre on PC. I’m certainly keen to strap in and race some more.”</em></p>

<figure><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0cf0e382505e/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A recent online post from the US Department of Homeland Security has prompted calls from angry fans for The Pokémon Company to initiate legal action against the US federal department.</p>
<p>If you've somehow missed it, the post — <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">entitled 'Gotta Catch 'Em All'</a> — contains a video mixing the Pokémon anime's famous intro with footage of law enforcement agents handcuffing and detaining people.</p>
<p>The use of the Pokémon IP to promote the wave of recent, controversial arrests by ICE agents in the US has some fans calling on the IP owners to take legal action, with replies <a href="https://x.com/LordFemto725/status/1970703790773813509">tagging official accounts</a> on X and <a href="https://x.com/Melb0urne__82/status/1970354243941867594">referencing Nintendo's notoriety</a> as a litigious company protective of its brands.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fylgivk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">speaking with IGN</a>, The Pokémon Company's former Chief Legal Officer Don McGowan says that he believes a lawsuit is unlikely, mentioning specifically the green-card status of many of TPC's executives in the US and a general aversion to publicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons. First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p>
<p>"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referencing Pokémon's famous catch phrase, the minute-long video plays the theme tune to the '90s anime in its entirety, cutting between clips from the intro featuring Ash Ketchum and footage of doors being blown open with explosives.</p>
<p>'Department of Homeland Security' appears in a font similar to the Pokémon logo, followed by blurred footage of Border Patrol agents detaining people. A number of Pokémon TCG-style card mock-ups are shown at the end, displaying convicted individuals with a weakness to Ice-type.</p></section>

            <p>A release date for the upcoming action-RPG Nioh 3 has leaked, courtesy of a listing found on Amazon Japan. In addition, the launch platforms for the game have also been revealed alongside what will be coming in the game's collector's edition.</p>
<p>These listings (now taken down but <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">spotted by Gematsu</a>) show both a standard edition as well as a Treasure Box Edition for the game, both set to release on 6th February, 2026 for PS5 and PC (Steam).</p>

<p>This leak arrives the morning prior to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-next-playstation-state-of-play-airing-tomorrow-extended-look-at-housemarques-saros-confirmed">Sony's next State of Play livestream</a>, which was announced yesterday and will kick off at 10PM UK time tonight. We already know it will feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Housemarque's upcoming game Saros</a>, but the official blog noted it'll focus on both PlayStation Studios and third-party games. So, an official Nioh 3 trailer or reveal wouldn't be off the table!</p>
<p>What's more, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-announced-and-theres-a-demo-out-now">game was first revealed at the last State of Play in June</a>, accompanied by a limited time demo. The trailer showed off its dual Ninja and Samurai playstyles.</p>
<p>A 6th February release date lands Nioh 3 in relatively clear waters. The day prior, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-is-getting-a-full-remake-and-its-not-hd-2d">Dragon Quest 7: Reimagined is making a splash</a> on all modern consoles, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-creators-mewgenics-finally-gets-a-release-date-almost-13-years-after-it-was-announced">Mewgenics is the current indie to look out for</a> on the 10th February. But other than that, the coast appears clear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced a trio of new games in a digital showcase for Tokyo Game Show 2025, all three of which can be played by visitors to the Makahuri Messe this weekend. From the residential care of D-topia, to musical RPG action of People of Note and classic action-adventuring of Demi and the Fractured Dream, let’s dive in:</p>
<h3>D-topia</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="D-topia | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Marumittu Games, assume the role of a resident maintenance worker at the D-topia residential facility, addressing citizen’s concerns, solving puzzles and uncovering secrets. Is this AI managed utopia everything it seems? There’s puzzle-adventuring with exploration and narrative choices that aims to get back to the human heart as opposed to the AI management.</p>

<h3>People of Note</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe title="People of Note | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note is a musical narrative adventure wrapped around a turn-based role-playing game. It’s a full-on musical with heartfelt song and choreography through musical sequences, but that’s also fed into the battle system and game mechanics through musical expressions and abilities.</p>
<h3>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h3>
<p><em>Coming in 2026 to PS5, XSX|S, Switch, Switch 2 and PC</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Demi and the Fractured Dream | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Demi and the Fractured Dream is a tribute to classic action-adventure games from developer Yarn Owl, focusing on nostalgic hack and slash combat and environmental puzzle and platforming. Demi is a voidsent person who’s been born into the world of Somnus and is now seeking away to escape his fate, following a mysterious voice and helped by an acolyte on his adventure across dangerous lands.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released update 1.3.0 for Mario Kart World on Switch 2, with this update bringing some new changes to the kart racer. One of the biggest changes is that players can now join any friends that are playing Knockout Tour online, and two players can free roam together while waiting to join online activities. Other changes include reducing the time item boxes reset, making it easier to find UFOS in free roam, and showing found collectibles on the map. The full patch notes are below.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Mario Kart World review, Stefan said, <em>“Mario Kart World takes that big and bold step into a different style of racing. A big open world, bigger lobbies, and a Battle Royale style multiplayer mode add up to a Mario Kart that is both familiar and refreshingly new. It’s not as tightly tuned as Mario Kart 8 was, but this is still a lot of fun, and essential for the Nintendo Switch 2.”</em></p>

			<p>Riot Games has announced the launch date for the early access version of 2XKO, its long-awaited fighting game. 2XKO will open its gates to all PC players on October 7, just as the currently ongoing Closed Beta ends. </p>



<p>The developers said the newest playable characters, Vi and Blitzcrank, have been quickly adopted by the fans, who have also already organized many community tournaments during this Closed Beta test. Meanwhile, Riot has been tuning matchmaking and fixing bugs, and they reckon everything has held up well enough so far, giving them the proverbial green light for the next step.</p>



<p>The early access version will add Combo Trials, a full season worth of content, and also permanent unlocks; that is to say, there will be no more resets from October 7 onward.</p>

<p>There will be five seasons in 2026, each adding a new champion, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. This means that 2XKO's tenth champion will be released when Early Access goes live on October 7. A dedicated gameplay reveal trailer and developer update are coming soon.</p>



<p>Being a Riot game, it's no surprise that they already have a plan for the competitive scene. To begin with, the developer is sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments in 2025 as part of the so-called First Impact Program. Each First Impact event, starting with EVO France (October 10-12), will receive a bonus from Riot, and there will be an additional prize for winning as a duo. </p>



<p>2XKO has long been known as Project L, a game spearheaded by the Cannon brothers, former developers of the fighting game Rising Thunder. The project got its final name in February 2024, when Riot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a 2025 release window for both PC and consoles</a>. It looks like they didn't quite make it in time for consoles, which won't be a part of this early access debut.</p>



<p>2XKO is a free 2v2 fighting game featuring iconic League of Legends champions. Players can team up with or against friends for explosive showdowns, and master a variety of unique tag and assist mechanics to defeat the enemy duo.</p>
