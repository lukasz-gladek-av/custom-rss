<p>Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble join the party</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced that it will soon be expanding the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library with a pair of classic 3D platformers.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> will be added to the service on <strong>17th December 2025</strong> (that's next week!), so expect to see a lot of floating hands/feet with no arms/legs attached to 'em.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1999 by Ubi Soft, Rayman 2 sees you tasked with saving the Fairy Glade from Admiral Razorbeard and his army of robots. There's all of the usual collecting and platforming peril that you would expect from a Rayman title, but we remember having a jolly good time with this one back in the day, and it's always nice to have an excuse to pick it up again.</p>
<p>Ubi launched Tonic Trouble the very same year, and while not quite as beloved as its platforming pal, it brings the weirdness with its story. This one will have you playing as an alien named Ed, who's sent down to Earth to clean up a little supernatural conqueror problem after he inadvertently pollutes the planet's water supply with a strange liquid.</p>

<p>Those with an NSO + Expansion Pack membership will be able to play both of these titles on the service next Wednesday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-gaming-light-bars-are-back-to-their-lowest-price-and-work-with-alexa-google-assistant-2000652084</link>
            <guid>1378486</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So, you’ve invested in a good gaming PC, a high-resolution display, and an immersive sound setup, but the whole thing still feels incomplete? You need good lighting to match your in-game mood and aesthetics. Hardly any brand does smart lighting better than Govee, and we just spotted its gaming light bars going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">This pair of lightbars, with a smart controller, retails for $90, but you can pick them up for just $55 today, after a sweet 39% discount.</a> There are no coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to follow; just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase, which ultimately brings the total cost down even further. Best of all, if you place your orders today, you’re going to get them before Christmas, which is great for anyone looking to host game nights with friends during the holidays. However, considering how this is the lowest price these have dropped to since launch, we’re not expecting the discount (or the stock) to be around for long. If your current play setup is in need of a bit of personality, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>You’re getting a sleek pair that can sit nicely on either side of your desk, and lets you choose from 16.8 million colors for DIY lighting effects for a personalized experience. There are over 60 preset scene modes, as well; basically one for every mood. The dedicated app lets you tweak settings, adjust modes, play around with colors, and more. In fact, the scenes are divided into categories like emotion, games, festival, and funny, which makes the light bars great for year-round use. Go for a brighter setting when you’re feeling a rush of energy inside, a warmer tone during holiday dinners, and maybe switch to something a bit calmer on those slow nights.</p>
<p>The lights are capable of syncing with audio from both your speakers and headphones, a feature that lets them react to whatever’s happening on your computer screen. Expect a cozy setup during those cute Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin moments in Crash Landing on You, and let the lights go wild when it’s time to take out some bad guys in Valorant. Translation? A much more immersive viewing and gaming experience that makes you feel like a part of the action.</p>



<p>The smart desktop dial takes the experience even further by allowing you to adjust the brightness, change the modes/colors, and turn the light bars on/off without pulling your phone out. Just keep it on your desk, and make necessary adjustments in seconds when needed. Voice control is supported, too, as the lights play nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant. This way, you can simply speak to command; ideal for when you can’t afford to take your hands off the controller or keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">These smart LED gaming lights are now down to $55, thanks to this 39% discount at Amazon.</a> They not only offer a ton of colors to choose from, but also include preset modes and music syncing capabilities to upgrade the entire vibe of your place. Snap it up quick, though, as the deal could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/magsafe-5000mah-portable-charger-for-iphone-drops-to-all-time-low-but-only-for-prime-members-2000652131</link>
            <guid>1378483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fumbling with charging cables while trying to use your phone feels like a problem from the previous decade, and <strong>MagSafe technology finally removes this annoyance by magnetically snapping power banks directly to your iPhone’s back</strong>. This <em>TRKOY</em> wireless charger delivers 5,000mAh of backup power in a slim profile that stays attached while you scroll, call, or photograph without requiring any cables during use. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $19, down from the usual $32, though you’ll need a Prime membership to access this deal</a> and grab one of the most practical iPhone accessories available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Magnetic Strength That Stays Strong</h2>
<p>The<strong> 15N magnetic force makes a connection that is strong enough</strong> to keep the power bank attached even when you’re walking, talking on the phone, or taking pictures at weird angles. This magnetic strength is just right because it keeps the charger connected during normal use but lets go easily when you pull it off on purpose. This way, you don’t have to deal with magnets that are either too weak to hold or too strong to separate without a lot of effort. You can answer calls, look at social media, or take selfies while the charger stays perfectly aligned on the back of your phone and this solves the cable management problems that come with regular power banks.</p>



<p>The phone and charger package is easy to handle with one hand because it is <strong>only 11.8 mm thick and weighs 120 grams</strong>: This is not the case with bulky power banks that make your phone feel like a brick and this slim design doesn’t get in the way of your phone’s cameras, so you can take pictures and videos without the charger blocking the lenses or making weird shadows. The design works well for situations where you need power but can’t put your phone down for a long time, like following GPS directions while walking, streaming events live, or keeping video calls going during your commute.</p>
<p>The <strong>5,000mAh capacity gives you enough power to fully charge an iPhone 17 once</strong> but for larger Pro Max models, this means about 50–80% of a full charge, and for standard and Mini models, it means a full charge. This amount of power is a good balance between useful backup power and keeping the charger slim enough to carry every day. However, people who use a lot of power every day might find the capacity limiting.</p>



<p>With dual charging, you can charge your iPhone wirelessly with MagSafe while also charging another device, like AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even an iPad, through the USB-C port at faster wired speeds. You won’t have to carry around a bunch of chargers or decide which device gets power first when you’re away from outlets because of this flexibility. You <strong>can also use the USB-C port to charge the power bank itself</strong>&nbsp;which makes things easier because you can use the same USB-C cable that charges many modern devices.</p>
<p>Comprehensive protection circuitry keeps an eye <strong>on the temperature, voltage, and current during the charging process</strong> to stop overheating, overcharging, and short circuits that could harm your phone’s battery or put your safety at risk. The smart cooling chip controls how heat is released which makes sure the charger stays at safe temperatures even when it’s charging for a long time.</p>
<p>When you compare it to other magnetic chargers from well-known brands that cost $40 to $60 or more, spending $19 on a MagSafe power bank is a great deal. The usual price of $32 already made it competitive with other options, but the 39% discount for Prime members makes it so cheap that people will want to buy it right away because it’s so convenient.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">recent firings of 34 <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers</a> at Rockstar UK have generated a lot of suspicion that the action was <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">a response to these workers being unionized</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">Protests have ensued</a>, and today the topic was raised in the UK’s Parliament, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer describing the situation as “deeply concerning.”</p> <p>The 34 members of the Scottish development team were fired in October based on claims of “gross misconduct” by Rockstar, but this was quickly refuted by the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) representing unionized developers, saying that it was in fact an act of “union busting.” Rockstar has heavily denied this, but <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">the IWGB has pressed ahead with a case for unfair dismissal</a>, and the protests continue.</p>

 <p>This furor has now reached the UK government, after the MP for Rockstar’s constituency of Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Chris Murray, raised the matter during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions. Asking a question of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Murray raised the claims of union busting, and explained that he had met with Rockstar and that they had “failed to reassure me they are following employment law.”</p>

 <p>“It’s a deeply concerning case,” said Keir Starmer. “Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we’re determined to strengthen workers’ rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he raises and keep him updated.”</p>   <p>For context, Prime Minister’s Questions is a weekly event in the UK Parliament that takes place every Wednesday lunchtime, where the leader of the opposition and other members of Parliament are able to put questions to the Prime Minister. This usually begins with a tiresomely performative piece of theater as the two main rival party leaders exchange overly scripted insults designed to win headlines, before it then moves on to a more useful period in which genuine concerns can be raised in the House.</p>

 <p>However, it’s important to note that while opposition questions will usually be loaded with point-scoring, questions coming from the PM’s own party are very rarely combative, and usually pre-planned—the likes of, “Would the Prime Minister agree that we’re all doing a completely splendid job, and the Conservatives were super-extra rubbish?” Murray’s question, while obviously not sycophantic, was certainly planned and Starmer’s reply was pre-written.</p>

 <p>Labour is, in theory, a pro-union party, and has historically been in large part funded by the UK’s various major unions, as opposed to the Conservatives who are mostly funded by big businesses and Satan himself. However, in recent years Labour has betrayed its union roots to the degree that it’s now losing the support of many trade unions. Starmer actually saying something pro-union will be a relief to many, and hopefully put a chill down the spine of many corporations who thought there was no more need to worry about stomping all over their workers.</p> <p>Or it’ll be another lie and nothing will happen. But it’s fun to pretend to have hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) intends to have Rockstar Games investigated for alleged union busting. </p>



<p>During Wednesday’s UK Parliament session, MP Chris Murray asked Prime Minister Kier Starmer about the allegations. Murray said that after meeting with Rockstar over the firings, the company “failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.”</p>







<p>He then asked Starmer if he agrees that <strong>“all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union.”</strong></p>



<p>Starmer responded by saying that it’s a “deeply concerning case”.</p>



<p><strong>“Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we’re determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union,” </strong>he said. <strong>“Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated.”</strong></p>



<p>In October, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 employees</a> were fired from Rockstar. Immediately, employees and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed it was a “blatant and ruthless” act of union busting. Rockstar, however, denied that claim, saying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were fired</a> for <strong>“gross negligence”</strong> after finding that they were <strong>“distributing and discussing confidential information”.</strong></p>







<p>Not long after that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages</a> suggest that the information being shared involved discussions of new company policies with other employees, among other messages. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times to Rockstar for official comment on the claims. As of writing, no responses have been received.</p>

            <guid>1378468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, the best thing you can do is pick a goal and move towards it. You might have no idea how to get where you wanna go; you might have no idea where you are when it comes to accomplishing it; and you might not have much outside help, but you’ll do it anyway. What other choice is there? Just keep moving forward, and maybe something good will happen. That philosophy guided me through my three hours with Outward 2, a video game that mostly wanted me dead and was very good about making it happen. Everybody needs goals, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After making a character in Outward 2’s fairly (at least right now) limited character creator and choosing different elements of my backstory, which altered my starting stats – the RPG standard Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower – my journey started in the city of Haboob, which has been recently reclaimed from the Scourge. I don’t know what that means, exactly, but it sounded good. Anyway, my recently arrived character won the housing lottery when a guy named Sebastian decided to move. Here I was, less than five minutes into the game and already a homeowner. Talk about a fantasy. We chatted before he left, and he seemed nice enough, and then I headed out to explore the city. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Outward 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Haboob is gorgeous – a multilayered city of stone, with these giant rotating fans (there’s one in my house, near the bed) and I enjoy walking around it for a bit, grabbing  an “on the house” (pun intended) drink at the local tea shop, and enjoying the vibe. Outward 2 isn’t the most visually sophisticated game out there – the character models kinda look like they stepped out of an Xbox 360-era Bethesda RPG – but its environments are pretty grand. After wandering around for a bit and speaking to the local Chamberlord, who hands over the deed to my new house, I call it a night. There’s not much else to do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Haboob is gorgeous – a multilayered city of stone...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m awoken when a guard breaks in and tries to rob me (rude!) and whacks me in the head with a mace. Sebastian shows up to kill him, takes whatever it is, and then places the pistol he used to take care of the guard in my hand. At least he looks sorry about it, but because all the evidence of the murder points to me, I’m exiled with little more than what’s in my possession. The Chamberlord suggests I find Sebastian to prove my innocence.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Back to Square One</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Outward 2 is a survival game, which means I need to find, craft, or buy my supplies. Out in the world, there’s nothing to guide you. I had no map and no leads. The only thing around was a big, dead bird under what looked like some sort of mystical lamp post. I decided to head east. Always into the east. I got into a couple fights, one of which was against a dude that really didn’t seem to want to be there. Outward’s combat isn’t going to blow anyone away, but it’s weighty and generally pretty solid. I’m doing all right even though I only have an ice pick and a bow I picked up in the city until I fall into a small, rocky hole. I can’t walk or roll out of it and Outward 2 has no jump button. I end up starting a new run. I ran into a lot of bugs in my time with my preview build of Outward 2 – items would duplicate or not be usable, characters would float in mid-air, and so on – but that’s to be expected of something this early.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I tried to use it as an opportunity. This time, I spent more time in Haboob because I knew I was going to get kicked out, found some new people to talk to, and was generally better equipped when I was framed for murder. Again. I just bought a house in real life, so I was particularly upset about this. How dare this dude? Who does he think he is?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was lucky in other ways. Remember that dead bird from last time? In its place, I found a woman named Oliele who helped me out by offering me some supplies, including a tent and a map, and told me where I might find Sebastian. There were a couple possibilities. I opted to head northeast to the True Levantines. Even with my supplies, life wasn’t easier. Drinking river water made me sick to my stomach, and my ice pick wasn’t a force in combat. I scavenged enough wood to build a shield and mostly tried to avoid fights. Even the map wasn’t much help. Oh, yeah, it was nice to see what the region looked like, but the map doesn’t track where you are, so… you know, it works like a real map. Outward 2 is willing to let you get lost, and I appreciated that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Second Chances</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This time, I didn’t fall into a hole, but I did run into other problems. Combat was risky, and when I camped for the night because my character was exhausted, I got attacked and… I couldn’t fight back. I could move, but I couldn’t swing my weapons. I opted to die, thinking that would be the end of it. Instead, I got a special little sequence because I died near a river, and washed up on its banks, my gear close by. Minus my tent.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after, I spotted a weird ghost and tried to pick a fight. That was a <em>bad idea. </em>Not only could I barely hurt him with my ice pick, he never stopped following me when I tried to run away, so I followed the path I was on, the spectre hot on my heels, until I just happened to run into the True Levantine settlement and the guards finished him off for me. No sign of Sebastian, but I had a lead: south. Okay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I got back on the road and died a whole bunch. I died to a big bird. I died to a weird bat thing. I fell over once and died. I died because I bled out. Each time I was rescued. Sometimes by a nice guy named Gep who I never met but left me a drink at his campfire. Sometimes by the healers at the True Levantine camp. Eventually, I decided it was time to buy a sword. I sold what little I had, and from there, things got easier. I made progress south. I found a weird tower where everything wanted to kill me. I killed an exiled mercenary and stole *his* tent. Ha! I explored a weird little cave and did some mining. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point I was rolling, and I figured I’d keep going until I died. Then I ran into one of those weird bat things again, and that was that. Three hours had flown by. Outward 2 doesn’t hold your hand, and I admire that. Exploring its gorgeous world is a lot of fun. I wish it was a little less buggy, and I wish that there was a bit more to do in a world that can sometimes feel big and empty – gathering materials in the areas I explored was difficult, and I didn’t get to craft as much as I wanted; I really wanted some linen, and I could not find or buy any of me for the life of me – but I did enjoying just picking a direction, setting off into the world, and seeing what I could see. There’s something special in that, and if the full release of Outward 2 can capture it, it might just make you want to go for a stroll.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/outward-2-is-an-rpg-that-wanted-me-dead-but-i-liked-exploring-its-world]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another day, another Skyrim port — this time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition"><u>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Anniversary Edition</u></a> is out on Nintendo Switch 2 after a shadowdrop — and even Bethesda can see the funny side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim’s release on Switch 2 has resurfaced jokes about Bethesda milking the life out of its open-world fantasy role-playing game by releasing it on all the platforms under the sun. Skyrim has been ported and remastered so many times that it’s become one of the internet’s most enduring memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a bit of a joke at this point how often we release Skyrim, but it's a great game," Bethesda's Matt Carofano, creative director of the Switch 2 version, said while talking to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Life</u></a>. "We want everyone to be able to play it in the best way possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that, it seems, is at the crux of Skyrim's numerous ports. With each new hardware generation, Bethesda has an opportunity to reach a whole new generation of players who get to experience its RPG for the first time. This time, it's Switch 2, giving the development team the chance to "take advantage of the new hardware."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years after Skyrim's original release in 2011, Bethesda worked on a "remastering process," improving the lighting and graphics features. Now, on Switch 2, it can make use of things like volumetric lighting and improved weather conditions, fog, and clouds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had previously done the version for the Switch, so this was going back to that and making improvements on it," Carofano said. "So it was really an easy development process and actually pretty quick in terms of our timelines. Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster. Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of everything, though, Carofano says it's the general performance that most impresses him, as the game "performs better, runs smoother, and loads faster. So it's just a better play experience on the Switch 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on why so many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before"><u>people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim</u></a> over a decade after its release, lead designer Bruce Nesmith recently said: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is, of course, working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls VI, but it has said next to nothing about it. We do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>it will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a>, after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Todd Howard recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-boss-todd-howard-wont-rule-out-an-elder-scrolls-tv-show-but-says-fallout-was-more-uniquely-suited-for-an-adaptation"><u>refused to rule out the possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV adaptation</u></a>, but did suggest the post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise <a href="https://b/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fallout</u></a> — the second series of which debuts on December 17 — was better suited to an adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p>Developer Expression Games has released the first gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-let-loose-vietnam/">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, a hardcore 50v50 first-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bwfPLwLwQk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match.</p><p>Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements.</p><p>History buffs will also appreciate the attention to detail in this shooter, as everything from the military uniforms to the firearms players use are designed to be as historically authentic as possible. Even better, there's not a single note of Creedence Clearwater Revival music to be heard in the trailer.</p><p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will launch in 2026 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

That's especially relevant, considering this year's Black Ops 7 follows last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-6" target="_blank">Black Ops 6</a>; before that, the Call of Duty team released&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/not-so-special-ops" target="_blank">Modern Warfare III</a>&nbsp;in 2023, one year after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/wide-of-the-mark">Modern Warfare II</a> in 2022.</p><p>It sounds like this type of release cadence won't happen again moving forward, according to a new <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">blog post</a> from the Call of Duty team. In the post, the team thanks the community for the feedback over the last few months, noting, "We also know that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully." It then says, "To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations moving forward."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TMNklf_qtQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TMNklf_qtQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The blog post then details the future of Black Ops 7, including a free week of multiplayer and zombies next week, a Double XP weekend, and "unprecedented seasonal support," before announcing the aforementioned release cadence change for the franchise.</p><p>"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games," the post reads. "The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."&nbsp;</p><p>The post concludes by stating that the future of Call of Duty is strong and that the teams involved believe the best days are ahead. We'll see how this plays out for the franchise in the coming years.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team17-expression-games-show-off-hell-let-loose-vietnam-gameplay-in-new-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1378450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-team17-future-games-show-gamescom-2025/">was announced this summer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, with publisher Team17 and Expression Games bringing its brand of strategic shooter gameplay to a new setting following its initial World War II setting. </p>



<p>Today, Expression Games and Team17 put out a new gameplay trailer, after the more cinematic-focused trailer shown at Gamescom as part of the game's reveal. The trailer shows off a 50v50 battle in this "<em></em><em>war with no front lines</em>" setting.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six Vietnam maps, including dense jungles to fight through, and some more open and clear battlefields to offer strategic variety in how each match can be approached. You'll be able to hop in a helicopter and deploy troops at different points on the battlefield, take control of patrol boats for a small slice of naval combat, and North Vietnam forces can use a tunnel system to move around the maps for surprise attacks and strategic advantages against American troops.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One thing the trailer did not include, however, was a release date, as we're still just looking at a 2026 release window. A press release for the trailer does make it clear that this is in-engine gameplay footage, however, so hopefully, this look at gameplay is a sign that we're not too far off from when a release date will be revealed.</p>



<p>Expression Games has already made it clear that it will continue to support Hell Let Loose once Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is in the public's hands, though a difference worth noting between the two titles is that there's currently no indication that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be an early access release like Hell Let Loose before it.</p>



<p>It appears that Expression Games is just ready to release Vietnam as a full 1.0 version. Hopefully, whenever it launches, it'll feel like a full and finished product.</p>

            <p>Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, are marching on despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">losing staff</a> after Microsoft suddenly pulling funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> amid mass layoffs this summer. Romero says the project isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">living on in its previous guise</a>, but is instead having elements pulled from it as part of a near-total redesign into a smaller game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The veteran developer revealed this in an onstage chat at Spanish games show Salón del Videojuego de Madrid spotted by our mates over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring">European Videogameplayer</a>. "So, we survived the cancellation of a huge game," Romero said when asked about what he's currently working on.</p>
<p>The game's been basically completely redesigned," he continued. "The new game has nothing to do with the previous game, but it incorporates a lot of the elements that we had in the previous game. So, we're not starting at ground zero. We have 50 million worth of a game [that] we can take pieces out of and put [them] into a brand new indie game."</p>

<p>"It's a much smaller game," Romero added. "It's more fun for us, because the people working on it were all directors of different departments and they didn't actually get to code or design or whatever - do it themselves - and so now we get to actually do that do the thing that we're really good at ourselves."</p><p>As for what this new game emerging from the old one's ashes will be like, the dev kept his info shotgun close to his chest, outside of confirming that it's still a shooter. "The things that you do in it will be, I'd say, probably new to people [in] the way that going through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience. It was a very crazy place and a different world and it was really cool to explore it and just see 'What is that?' That's the idea behind what we're doing in this game."</p>
<p>It's tough to read much into that last bit in my eyes, but regardless, here's hoping Romero and co's revamped shooty thing can stick the landing whenever it's ready.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holiday season is a great time to finally make the purchases that feel a little out of budget the rest of the year. If you’ve been eyeing a laptop upgrade for yourself, or want to gift one to someone who really needs to let go of their old machine, now is a great time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">The latest Lenovo IdeaPad in the stunning cosmic blue color, just dropped by 73% on Amazon, which brings its price down to $1,235</a>. It typically sits over $4,000, so this discount puts it in a much more affordable price range. This version comes packed with features that are great for professional use, and apart from the discount, you’re also getting an accessory kit thrown in for free with your purchase. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, as well, meaning you’re getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box. It ships before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to gift it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>For a little over $1,200, you’re getting a machine that flaunts a Cosmic Blue aluminum chassis that’s both refined and rugged. It gives off a premium feel, but meets military grade standards that protect it from everyday wear and tear well. There’s a stunning 16-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS touchscreen offering 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare finish; both making for an immersive, yet comfortable viewing experience. Integrated Intel Graphics takes care of your late-night streaming sessions, online meetings, creative tasks, and even some gaming with ease, plus is paired with intelligent power allocation that maintains smooth visuals even when things get intense.</p>
<p>You’ll find a high-quality FHD 1080p IR camera with a physical privacy shutter for better video calls. It supports Windows Hello facial login, which adds another layer of security and lets you safely log in to the system even in dim lighting. Speaking of dimmer settings, the keyboard features a bright backlight that makes it easy to type long documents and work your way through projects 24/7; great for those of you who often find themselves pulling all-nighters.</p>



<p>As for power, you’ve got a muscular 10-core Intel Core 7 240H processor capable of hitting speeds up to 5.2 GHZ, and an on-chip AI Boost NPU rated at 18 TOPS. These make the machine more than capable of running resource-intensive programs and handling everyday workload without a hint of lag. The 32GB DDR5 RAM lets you multitask through busy days like a pro, while the massive 2TB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important content and files in a single place. The latter also offers much faster boot and load times, making the whole system snappier from the moment you power it on. What’s more, the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively, so you can always make necessary adjustments as your needs grow.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity comes from WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Port-wise, it gets you dual USB-C (DP 1.4 + PD 3.0), dual USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (one Always On), HDMI 1.4b, microSD reader, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">And finally, the accessory kit includes a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, a screen wipe, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.</a> That’s everything you need to get started with work and play right away. Just be sure to snap the deal up fast, as it is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and it adds new Mega Evolutions, timed roguelike expeditions, and some more story to tie it all together. However, hidden in all this new stuff is the death of a dream that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans have nurtured for years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu’s two mega forms</span></a><span> may have been met with celebration from fans, but by finally giving the boy his due, Game Freak put the final nail in the coffin of Pikachu’s original final form, Gorochu.</span></p> <p><span>For those who don’t know, Gorochu was meant to be a third form in the Pikachu evolution line back in the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>days. This mysterious form never saw the light of day, but Game Freak has described </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/"><span>it in interviews</span></a><span>. While discussing the original Pikachu design process in 2018, artist Atsuko Nishida said that her original parameters for the electric mouse that would become the series’ mascot were that it had to be an electric-type monster that would evolve twice. Nishida designed Pikachu, Raichu, and Gorochu, but this third and final monster never made it into the final game. It had fangs and horns, and Nishida said it looked like “a god of thunder.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the same interview, artist Ken Sugimori says there was “nothing wrong” with Gorochu’s design, and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>designer Koji Nishino said it was ultimately cut for game balance purposes and because there was only so much space on older Game Boy cartridges, so some monsters got cut along the way. In 2020 the original source code for these games leaked, which included <a href="https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_Index_175">Gorochu’s back sprite</a>. This is the only “official” look we’ve gotten of the monster, but one of the </span><a href="https://x.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649"><span>most popular pieces of Gorochu fan art</span></a><span> captures </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>Sugimori’s style</span></a><span> so well that many fans believe it to be an in-house artistic rendition of the scrapped monster.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Raichu had an evolution named Gorochu, so I had a go at the design of it. Tried to keep consistent to the first generation of Pokemon's look and style. ⚡️ <a href="https://t.co/U4KrTr1DKW">pic.twitter.com/U4KrTr1DKW</a></p> <p>— VivinkArt (@VivinkArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>All this mystique has had fans asking for Game Freak to bring Gorochu back and make the Pikachu line the first “four-stage” monster, now that </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver </span></i><span>added Pichu, a pre-evolution to Pikachu. However, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC may have killed this dream, as it gives </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu two Mega forms</span></a><span>. As AZ lays out in the main game, Mega Evolution is only possible if a Pokémon has reached its final stage of Evolution. This isn’t just a fan assumption, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s endgame makes a point of driving this home by allowing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>AZ’s Floette</span></a><span>, which was unable to evolve due to its exposure to the Ultimate Weapon thousands of years prior, to Mega Evolve.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that Raichu is out here doing what only fully evolved Pokémon can do, Gorochu seems to be officially dead, but both of its Mega designs have some elements that feel like echoes of Gorochu. Both forms have fangs, and the Y variant has jackalope-style horns. The X form also flies around like he’s Superman, and that’s giving “god of thunder” in my eyes.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We’ll have a full review of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>in the coming days.</span></p>

</p></figure>



<p>At Gamescom earlier this year, Insider Gaming got hands-on with the game, calling it “familiar, but entirely different” thanks to the series’ new setting. You can read our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full hands-on preview of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam here</a>.</p>



<p>From our perspective, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p><strong>Game features:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Welcome to the Jungle – You and your fellow soldiers will be thrown into dramatic terrains and engage in warfare across 6 new Vietnam maps, featuring dense jungle, twisting deltas, and open clearings that offer unique tactical challenges.</li>



<li>Aerial Units – Allowing&nbsp;fully&nbsp;operational helicopters&nbsp;for troop deployment and fire support.&nbsp;&nbsp;These units play a pivotal role in transporting soldiers to landing zones,&nbsp;delivering supplies to the team in tactical locations,&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;reconnaissance,&nbsp;and offering aerial firepower.</li>



<li>Patrol boats&nbsp;– Take control of heavily armed vessels, such as&nbsp;the iconic U.S. patrol boat, the PBR.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Tunnels –&nbsp;The North Vietnamese forces can construct extensive tunnel networks, offering strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. This means that mastering tactics will become essential to winning the battle.​&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>History suggests the 2025 Steam Replay will release on Thursday, December 18, as this lines up with the last couple of iterations of Steam’s Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>If you ignore the slight outlier of Steam Replay 2022—made available to all users on December 26—and consider the last two incarnations, the proof is pretty much in the pudding present.</p>







<p>Steam Replay 2023 came out on Monday, December 18, and the year after, the 2024 replay was on Wednesday, December 18. You can see where Insider Gaming is going with this, but logic dictates that the date is the same for the last two years, so why would Steam break a winning habit?</p>



<p>Unless something weird happens or Steam has a Half-Life-sized facility meltdown, Thursday, December 18, seems like a reasonable assumption. Keep checking back on the day to see when Steam Replay 2025 is out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AMD’s next-gen “FSR Redstone” brings big gains, as long as you’re using a new GPU]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/amds-fsr-redstone-upscaling-claims-to-close-the-gap-with-nvidias-dlss/</link>
            <guid>1378414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>Nvidia, AMD, and Intel have all made high-quality image upscaling a cornerstone feature of their new GPUs this decade. Upscaling technologies like Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), and Intel’s Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) are all ways to transform a lower-resolution source image into a higher-resolution image, delivering better-looking games without requiring as much graphics hardware as you’d need to render the higher-resolution image natively. Later additions have focused on improving ray-tracing performance and “frame generation” technologies that boost frame rates by creating new AI-generated frames to insert between natively rendered frames.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Nvidia’s DLSS technologies have provided better image quality than AMD’s FSR, but they have only been available on newer Nvidia hardware—the GeForce RTX 20-series or newer for most features, with frame-generation features locked to the RTX 40- and 50-series. FSR’s results don’t look as good, but they have benefited from running on just about anything, including older GPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and even integrated Intel and AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>Today, AMD is trying to shift that dynamic with something called “FSR Redstone,” a collection of ray-tracing and frame-generation features all intended to boost AMD’s image quality while being relatively easy to implement for game developers who are already using FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.</p>
<p>The downside is that closing the quality and feature gap with Nvidia also apparently requires sticking with Nvidia-like hardware restrictions: like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">FSR 4 upscaling</a>, FSR Redstone will only be available on AMD’s latest-generation GPUs with the RDNA4 GPU architecture, including the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9060 series.</p>
<h2>Improvements in FSR Redstone</h2>


<p>FSR Redstone is a collection of four technologies, three of which are new and one that has just been renamed, and all of which can be mixed and matched based on the preferences of the game developer and the user.</p>
<p><strong>FSR Radiance Caching</strong> is a “real-time, neural network-based” system for improving performance and image quality for indirect lighting and global illumination. An AMD-trained lighting model allows the various bounces of light in a scene to be predicted “as soon as the second ray intersection,” according to AMD, saving the GPU from actually having to calculate and render subsequent bounces of light.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, John Romero--the creator of Doom and Quake--announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/" data-ref-id="1100-6532939">his next first-person shooter had been canceled</a>. Although Romero and his company, Romero Games, didn't confirm that the project was a victim of Microsoft's layoffs and cutbacks, one of Romero Games' laid-off employees did. However, it appears the still-unnamed shooter isn't completely dead, according to Romero himself.</p><p>During his appearance at <a href="https://youtu.be/-NypZpqoGOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Salón del Videojuego de Madrid</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Romero confirmed that the project is back on, and that it's been given a fresh redesign.</p><p>"We're not starting at ground zero," said Romero. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p><p>Romero clarified that the current incarnation isn't the same exact title as his previous project, but "it incorporates a lot of the elements" and it's a much smaller game in this version. He also played coy about what the gameplay will be like with cryptic hints that he has "never played a game like it," and "the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience ... That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p><p>Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-doom-devs-confirm-romero-games-is-not-closed-despite-game-cancelation/1100-6533006/" data-ref-id="1100-6533006">Romero Games confirmed its survival</a> last summer, some of Microsoft's internal studios hit by layoffs were not as lucky.

            <p>UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called the firing of 31 employees from GTA developer Rockstar "deeply concerning", adding that ministers will look into the controversial dismissals.</p>

The company, however, claimed the affected staff were fired for gross misconduct. Soon after, UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> for these dismissals, again noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">all those affected were union members</a>. Meanwhile, over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> signed a letter to management, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">condemning its actions</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the topic has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">arisen once again in parliament</a>, with Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray asking the prime minister if he agrees all companies "regardless of profit size" must "follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union".</p>

<p>Responding to Murray's concerns regarding Rockstar, Starmer said: "It's a deeply concerning case. Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.</p>
<p>"Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Murray met with the IWGB about the dismissals at Rockstar. "This has impacted many residents in varying ways, all have lost their livelihood, all have lost a role which they have invested a combined 200 years of service to, with some residents even now forced to leave the UK due to the removal of their visa sponsor," Murray said. "The consequences of this decision by Rockstar on so many families cannot be understated".</p><p>The Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP additionally arranged a meeting with Rockstar to question the developer about its actions. "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," Murray stated, adding he was "not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law". Further, the MP said the meeting with Rockstar did not convince him that the company's course of action was "necessary".</p>
<p>"Alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal," he closed. "The meeting began with us MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed."</p>

<p>Along with the ongoing situation between the affected members of staff and Rockstar, the company also recently also delayed the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, moving the game from May of next year into November. </p>
<p>Publisher Take-Two said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve"</a>. It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

<figure data-uuid="05cb12ec07ae8"><a title="LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/05cb12ec07ae8/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: WB Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hm, we're <em>sure</em> that we won't be looking back on this quote with a suspicious eye down the line. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/paramount-makes-rival-bid-for-warner-bros-after-netflixs-usd82-billion-offer-includes-game-studios">Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition agreement</a> with Warner Bros. Discovery (later challenged by a separate offer from Paramount), Netflix co-CEO, president and director Gregory Peters has said WB Games didn't really factor into the company's decision (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">recent earnings call</a>, where Peters and Theodore Sarandos — the other co-CEO — were asked if Warner Bros. assets would "enhance or accelerate" success in Netflix's gaming plans. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space," Peters responded, "we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things".</p>
<p>Peters went on to point out that Warner Bros. has "got great studios and great folks working there," and even noted that its properties have spawned financially successful games in the past. "We think we can incorporate that into what we're offering," he stated, "but just to be clear, we haven't built that into our business model".</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warner Bros. Games includes several big-hitting studios such as NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games and Portkey Games. While the company has been through a rocky number of years following the disappointing performance of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/suicide_squad_kill_the_justice_league">Suicide Squad</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/warner-bros-closes-three-studios-including-team-behind-smash-like-brawler-multiversus">shutdown</a> of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, among other things, there have also been financial successes with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the future of Warner Bros' game division might be under Netflix, though with Paramount Skydance launching a rival bid of its own earlier this week, we imagine it'll be a while before we hear anything concrete.</p>

			<p>It's been exactly five years since CD Projekt RED released Cyberpunk 2077. Today, the Polish studio is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its most recent game with a series of initiatives, including a special trailer looking back on the emotional story experienced by the protagonist, V, and the players while in the City of Legends.</p>



<p>It's been a whirlwind for sure, both in and out of the game. Riding on the hype guaranteed by the success of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the biggest digital game launch of all time</a> based on revenue and units (10.2 million units sold), but the game's bugs and performance issues on previous generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) heavily damaged its reputation, especially when Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delisted-from-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the game from the PlayStation Store</a>, a nearly unprecedented move for such a highi-profile game, until the developer fixed the problems.</p>



<p>CD Projekt RED worked very hard to achieve this, eventually delivering a more refined and expanded experience through various updates (particularly with version 2.0) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Fans recognized the improvement, and now Cyberpunk 2077 is once again appreciated. Over the past five years, it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 35 million units</a>, and more will be sold this Holiday season thanks to the heavy discounts (up to 65% off) available now across multiple storefronts. The game also has a sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in development</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Cyberpunk 2077 fans can look forward to the newly announced Cyberpunk Trading Card Game, announced in partnership with WeirdCo. As with most TCGs, a crowdfunding campaign will debut on Kickstarter next year. The Cyberpunk TCG will let players assemble the ultimate edgerunner crew comprising characters from across the franchise, pitting them against opponents in a battle to become Night City legends. Featuring custom artwork, Cyberpunk TCG is designed for trading card players, avid collectors and Cyberpunk franchise fans alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Several new partnerships and products were also announced as part of the fifth anniversary celebrations, offering players more ways to engage with the world of Cyberpunk 2077. The Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector’s Set is available to pre-order and gives players the chance to get their hands on secret Arasaka tech. Presented in a steel case, it includes a light-up replica of the Relic biochip from the game, a USB thumb drive containing the game's soundtrack, three holographic tarot cards, and two pins. The Collector's Set is available with or without Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition via the CD PROJEKT RED Gear Store.</p>



<p>In partnership with Corsair, an Arasaka Edition <a href="https://fave.co/48HjOR1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyboard</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/4a9YYw6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mouse</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/44gYErQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mousepad</a> have also been made available for pre-order, bringing a touch of the megacorp lifestyle to players' setups.</p>



<p>Brand-new Displates featuring custom artwork inspired by movie posters have also been unveiled, turning iconic Cyberpunk 2077 characters such as Jackie Welles, Panam Palmer, and Adam Smasher into would-be stars. Collectors can <a href="https://fave.co/3MrwfsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase</a> these Displates today.</p>



<p>CD PROJEKT RED has teamed up with Viture to create the limited-edition Cyberpunk 2077 Luma Cyber XR Glasses. These high-tech glasses are now available for purchase <a href="https://www.viture.com/product/viture-x-cyberpunk-2077-luma-cyber-xr-glasses?color=Jet+Black&amp;size=Regular+%28IPD+58-70mm%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Viture store</a> for $549. Lastly, Madrinas has a new Cyberpunk 2077 collection, featuring an anniversary cold brew and shaker set, <a href="https://madrinas.com/products/cyberpunk-2077-anniversary-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available for pre-order at $32.99</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/841342/amd-fsr-redstone-is-an-exciting-and-confusing-upgrade-for-radeon-pc-gamers</link>
            <guid>1378366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, AMD is soft-launching its latest suite of graphics and performance-enhancing tech, FSR Redstone — and it might take a second to wrap your head around. It certainly did for me.</p><p>The good news is that in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/news/amd-fsr4-over-85-games/">just three months</a>, AMD has more than doubled the number of games that support the flagship machine-learning version of its upscaling tech, FSR4, to over 200 games in all, and it’s launching ML-based frame generation (yes, “fake frames”) for over 30 titles too. You should be able to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/supported-games.html">find full game lists here </a>sometime today. Both techniques can dramatically increase your framerate while preserving image quality better than FSR 1, 2, or 3 allowed.</p><p>The awkward news is that after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">previously promising</a> “FSR Redstone” would arrive in the second half of this year, AMD is fulfilling that promise primarily by absorbing FSR4 into Redstone. FSR 4 is now “AMD FSR Upscaling (formerly AMD FSR4)”, and Redstone is the umbrella brand for the whole current suite of machine-learning product.</p><p>The absorption might be because AMD has only one game to show off its new FSR Ray Regeneration technique — <em><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/fsr-redstones-strange-debut-ray-regeneration-tested-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></em>, which already launched with it last month — and no games with FSR Radiance Caching, which it now says is available for game <em>developers</em> to bring to their games in 2026.</p><p>The slightly confusing news is that you won’t find options for FSR Redstone (or even FSR 4) inside most of your games. You’ll need to have a Radeon RX 9000-series card, as the company’s still saying the machine-learning versions of FSR are exclusive to those. You’ll also need to go into your AMD Software app to enable “AMD FSR Upscaling” and/or “AMD FSR Frame Generation” under the Gaming &gt; Graphics tab, and then you’ll need to enable AMD FSR 3.1 (or occasionally 4) inside the game itself.</p><p>That’s because the superior ML versions of these techniques need to be enabled on a per-game basis, but AMD can do it for you (and game developers) in the driver, as long as the games already support FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.</p><p>I bought an AMD RX 9070 XT myself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">after the last stunt Nvidia pulled</a>, but adoption of AMD’s latest hardware is still a little slow. They’ve<a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/343558/amd-radeon-rx-9000-series-still-absent-from-steam-hardware-survey"> yet to show up in the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, which could mean less than 0.15 percent of today’s PC gamers currently use them — though a generic “AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics” has gained 0.75 percent share on Steam since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214073529/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=name">a year ago.</a></p><p>That could change now that the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=591,592&amp;sort=price">can finally be found</a> at their original promised MSRP prices. They are good cards for that amount of money; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">here’s our March 2025 review</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841342/amd-fsr-redstone-is-an-exciting-and-confusing-upgrade-for-radeon-pc-gamers]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/evo-2026-marvel-tokon-mortal-kombat-lineup-2000652123</link>
            <guid>1378360</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fighting game lineup for Evo 2026 has been revealed and there’s a notable absence: <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>. Just three years after it launched, the content-complete sequel is not getting invited back to the world’s biggest annual fighting game event. Johnny Cage and Subzero will instead be making way for <a href="https://x.com/InvincibleVS/status/1996640662255816844"><em>Invincible Vs</em></a> and the <em>League of Legends</em> fighter <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a>.</p> <p>The Evolution Championship Series, another piece of gaming culture that was recently sold in part <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">to Saudi Arabia</a>, brings fighting game pros and fans to Las Vegas every summer for several days of <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2025-viral-moment-fatal-fury-meme-kog-go1-2000614619">big stage face-offs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">passion-fueled side-tournaments</a>. While<em> Street Fighter</em> remains king, other fighting games vie for top billing and occasionally circulate out of the main event. Despite having one of the wildest grassroots fandoms around, Nintendo’s <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-ultimate-melee-nintendo-switch-evo-2022-sony-1848598680">was a no-show</a> at Evo 2022 back when the event was owned by competitor Sony.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EVO Las Vegas 2026 lineup:<br>-SF6<br>-Tekken 8<br>-Fatal Fury CotW<br>-Under Night In-Birth Sys:Celes<br>-Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising<br>-Rivals of Aether 2<br>-2XKO<br>-Guilty Gear Strive<br>-BlazBlue Centralfiction<br>-Virtua Fighter 5 REVO World Stage<br>-Vampire Savior<br>-Invincible Vs <a href="https://t.co/Ar5In2RCNn">pic.twitter.com/Ar5In2RCNn</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1998566054268907575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This year’s big changes see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> dropped from the lineup while games like <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>, released a decade ago, get called back up to the majors. Some fans are wondering if it will be a wake-up call for NetherRealms, whose reboot of the franchise wasn’t bad but never quite hit the “we’re so back” vibes many were hoping for.</p>

 <p>Other notable swap-ins include the new <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which despite some issues and a content-lite launch has marshaled a passionate community around it, and <em>Rivals of Aether II</em>, the 2024 2D platform fighter that some fans argue still feels like an Early Access sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em> is also MIA</h2> <p>Even more notable than what was ditched is what wasn’t added. The Sony-published comic book fighting game <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384"><em>Marvel Tōkon</em></a> has a 2026 release window but won’t be on tap for Evo 2026. That suggests the heir apparent to <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> won’t be out until late in the year. <em>Marvel</em> <em>Tōkon</em> feels like the only recent new fighting game reveal to break through to a more casual audience and gin up excitement outside of the hardcore crowd, so it would have been a neat pick-up for next year’s event.</p> <p>Developer Arc System Works has been using Evo to reveal new bits about the 4v4 fighting game, so it seems likely it’ll still be involved with the tournament series in some way, just not as an esport. The game’s continued to run closed betas that have garnered lots of positive buzz so far. Hopefully it doesn’t get delayed to 2027.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="517">As much as some of us wish for an official handheld Xbox console, I wouldn’t recommending holding your breath. However, Asus is giving us something very close. In partnership with Microsoft, Asus has updated the ROG Ally, adding official Xbox branding. Enter the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, a new handheld gaming device aimed to rival the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Released less than two months ago, the device is already seeing a solid discount. Originally priced at $600, it’s now 18% off, dropping to $490—a savings of $110 this soon after launch.</a></p>
<p data-start="519" data-end="803">So what makes this model stand out from the previous Asus ROG Ally? For starters, it now features an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and runs on a redesigned Windows OS, both of which promise to deliver a smoother, more seamless experience both while gaming and navigating the interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="805" data-end="837"><strong data-start="805" data-end="837">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</strong></h2>
<p data-start="839" data-end="1315">With the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, your entire PC game library is at your fingertips, and you can boot straight into them from the new Xbox App UI. This handheld lets you stream Xbox games from your console or from Microsoft’s cloud service, and the Xbox Game Bar can be accessed with a press of the dedicated Xbox button on the left side. Beyond just Xbox titles, the device supports Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other platforms, so you’re not limited to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1317" data-end="1557">In terms of hardware, the ROG Xbox Ally comes equipped with 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD. If that storage doesn’t quite cut it for your game library, the storage is upgradeable, giving you room to expand as needed.</p>


<p data-start="1559" data-end="2051">The device features a 7-inch display with 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on par with other high-end handhelds like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 lbs, it’s roughly the same weight too. The redesigned chassis pulls inspiration from the Xbox wireless core controllers, with contoured grips for better comfort during long gaming sessions. You can play on the go or connect to your TV via the dual USB-C ports, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">To keep you gaming longer, the handheld includes a 60Wh battery that can recharge quickly. Just half an hour of charging gets you back up to 50% battery life.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">With these upgrades, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally series is shaping up to be a strong contender in the portable gaming market, offering versatility, performance, and a solid gaming experience. And right now, it’s down $110 for the holiday season.</p>
<p data-start="2233" data-end="2544">For those seeking more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is also available, offering an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery for even longer playtime, making it a solid option for those who want a premium handheld experience.</p>
