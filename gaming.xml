<figure><a title="Xenoblade / Days of our Lives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0dcf8f1da785/xenoblade-days-of-our-lives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The long-running American soap opera <strong>Days of Our Lives</strong> has made headlines recently after one of its regular characters name-dropped <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong>, of all things.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407">Nintendeal</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-cant-believe-a-days-of-our-lives-character-just-name-dropped-a-mid-tier-rpg-franchise-while-flirting">IGN</a>), the moment occurred when Aaron Greene attempted to invite Arianna Horton into his room by asking if she wants to "come play Xenoblade on my Switch". Looking like she just couldn't let the poor guy down, Arianna actually agreed and said "wow, uh, yeah, yeah sure".</p>

<p>It's not the first time a Nintendo franchise has been name-dropped in a TV show, and nor will it be the last, but usually it's the likes of Mario or Zelda that are the go-to franchises for something like this.</p>
<p>Here, however, the fact that Xenoblade is name-dropped indicates that the writer of this particular scene may be a fan; or at the very least is aware of the RPG series from developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p>It's gone down well with fans, regardless, with user <a href="https://x.com/ZhenghuaYang">Zhenghua Yang</a> stating "This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned. Top tier marketing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the weather starts cooling down and we start spending incrementally more time indoors week after week, there’s never been a better time to get yourself an iPad. Whether you plan on using it to catch up on emails, to doomscroll on your preferred social media app, or to just pour more hours into&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>but on a larger screen than your phone, the Apple iPad Air might be what you’re looking for. This 2025 model iPad normally starts at $599, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing the price down by 25%. This $150 savings means you’ll only have to pay as low as $449.</a></p>
<p>This $449 discounted price is for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model. There are three other storage sizes available—each with their own $150 discount. You can get the 256GB model for just $549, the 512GB model for just $749, or the 1TB model for just $949. If you want to add on cellular, the discounts are slightly different. The 128GB, 256GB and 1TB models are down $150 still but the 512GB model is only down $84.</p>
<p>For all combinations of storage or cellular capabilities, you can choose between four stylish colors. Pick either blue, purple, space gray, or starlight.</p>

<h2>Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>So AI has been a pretty big buzzword this past year. Will it be the future of consumer tech? Or is it just a speculative fixation like we went through with NFTs. We’ll find out in due time. Though for right now, Apple and companies like it have promised a ton to consumers with the inclusion of their own proprietary AI models they’re sticking into their products. Apple has Apple Intelligence which can be used to help you craft messages, generate images, and things of the like. The M3 chip is powerful enough to make local processing for Ai models such as this possible.</p>



<p>Beyond AI, the M3 chip allows for improved performance on power-hungry apps, letting you run them side-by-side with each other with no hiccups. Graphically intensive games also get a boost.</p>
<p>To get the full use out of your Apple iPad Air, you can pick up the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately). Use it to quickly jot down notes, draw or edit photos, and more. It’s compatible with tons of productivity and art apps on the App Store.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Finally get yourself that iPad you’ve been telling yourself you would with the 2025 model iPad Ai powered by Apple’s M3 chipset</a>. Most versions are on sale right now for $150 off.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mutant-football-league-2/">Mutant Football League 2</a> developer Digital Dreams has announced that the game will officially launch for PC and console on <strong>December 10</strong>. Originally launching in early access last year on PC--and in February 2025 on Xbox Series X|S via Game Preview--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-isnt-the-only-football-game-you-can-play-to-get-hyped-for-the-super-bowl/1100-6529297/">the NFL Blitz meets Evil Dead sports game</a> is the successor to the 2017 cult-classic football game, with the franchise first kicking off in the '90s under creator Michael Mendheim.</p><p>Like EA's popular Madden series, Mutant Football League 2 is focused on the rough-and-tough sport, but it's arguably better because you can tackle the opposition so violently that they can explode into a gory cloud of pink mist. The game mixes a dark sense of humor with 8-vs-8 arcade-style action between teams of Orcs, mutants, undead skeletons, and murderous robots. To make things even more ultraviolent, each arena is packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms.</p>

<p>Basically, if you're looking for an anti-Madden football game, this will probably appeal to you as you'll have to guide a team of rookies to the top of the Mutant Football League through its single-player season, Dynasty Supreme franchise mode, and online multiplayer.</p><p>Some of the big features in the sequel include 36 MFL teams to choose from, buildcrafting to power up your team's abilities with legal performance-enhancers like Skillroids, and the opportunity to create your very own stadium loaded with deathtraps.</p><p>"Mutant League is my bastard child that I've loved since its inception in the early nineties. And now, against all odds, our small team of passionate and dedicated developers has managed to resurrect it for a new generation," said creative director Michael Mendheim. "At its core, it’s fun, hard-hitting, and unpredictable--easy to pick up and play, yet layered with depth and strategy."</p><p>If you're interested in scoring a few vicious touchdowns, you can pick up the game on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

            <p>It turns out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s NPCs are basically playing their own game of Grand Theft Mario.</p>
<p>A video shared on social media by Supper Mario Broth explains how NPCs can actually steal a car belonging to another character.</p>
<p>Specifically, the video shows a green Shy Guy parking a vehicle and walking away. A Toad NPC then saunters up to the vehicle, jumps inside, and drives off, leaving the oblivious Shy Guy plodding down the road. Incredible!</p>

<p>Supper Mario Broth explained there are a few scenarios for the Shy Guy after this: the NPC will either keep walking until the player leaves and they despawn; they'll enter a building to despawn; or they'll steal a car themselves.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">In Mario Kart World, NPCs will park their cars, exit them, and walk around. However, the game does not actually keep track who each car belongs to. As such, a different NPC than the owner may drive away with a car, seemingly stealing it. <a href="https://t.co/KTXsDHXwiL">pic.twitter.com/KTXsDHXwiL</a></p>— Supper Mario Broth (@MarioBrothBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1968013677367525789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As much as Mario Kart World is full of these little details designed to make its open world feel alive, jacking cars seems very un-Nintendo for such a family-friendly game. Children, avert your eyes!</p>
<p>Have you spotted NPCs stealing cars in Mario Kart World?</p>

            <p>EA's Skate has now released into early access and has already proven so popular there are long queues to get in, with the team fixing ongoing outage issues.</p>
<p>Yet when players do get in, they're discovering skating isn't actually the optimal way to get around. In fact, videos on social media make the game look more like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>One player shared a video of their character rolling and jumping without a skateboard to overtake traffic and speed around the city.</p>

<p>Another player responded with a video of their character similarly rolling and jumping before belly flopping to slide over the ground.</p>
<p>Yet another player has found jumping from their board and flying to be an optimal way to build up speed.</p> <div>

<p>It's clear, then, Skate is not quite performing as expected. But for now, the studio is busy improving wait times, with the team "hard at work adding more servers and getting more skaters into San Van", it <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968048173492081010">wrote on social media</a>. "We appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>As per the game's subreddit, many players have been sitting waiting in queues, while others have joined a session but been shortly kicked out due to server issues.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="659"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1ninsuf/the_gameplay_so_far/">The gameplay so far</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BittaminMusic/">u/BittaminMusic</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/">SkateEA</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>As a result, many players have complained about Skate's online requirement. Developer Full Circle confirmed back in April the game would require an online connection.</p>
<p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," it wrote in an <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/skate-game-info-hub-en/the-grind-vol-1/12126312">FAQ</a>. "You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p>
<p>Still, that only works if players are able to get in, for which the studio is at least prioritising a fix.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67642939e169b/mario-kart-world-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that Europe will soon be treated to its very first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> online event, as it lifted the lid on the '<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/September/Take-part-in-the-first-ever-Mario-Kart-World-European-online-event--2914655.html">European September Circuit</a>'.</p>
<p>This online competition will get off the start line on <strong>27th September</strong>, running from <strong>5pm BST - 7pm BST (6pm CET - 8pm CET)</strong>. It'll see participants speeding through a series of 150cc VS Races, all in the hopes of keeping their Versus Ranking as high as possible. Each player will start with a Versus Ranking of 3,000 points, which will go up or down depending on race outcomes, and one the two hours are up, that ranking is locked in.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like a bit of you, you can take part by following the instructions below. A Switch 2, Mario Kart World and active Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required to participate, but you lovely lot knew that already, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the Mario Kart World main menu and select 'Online Play'</li>
<li>Hit '-' to search for an event and enter the Event ID <strong>1023</strong></li>
<li>Once the confirmation has gone through, you're in!</li>
</ul>
<p>One week after the event wraps up, Nintendo will publish a leaderboard of the 100 highest-ranked players from the European September Circuit. There's no <em>prize</em> for the winner, as such, but the bragging rights speak for themselves.</p>
<p>A similar event cropped up in Japan last month, with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">Summer Vacation Skill Test</a>' similarly putting drivers through their paces. Let's hope we see more friendly competition in the future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-why-battlefield-6-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-bf4%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98levolution%E2%80%99.1300113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even before DICE and the other teams formally unveiled Battlefield 6, the developers already <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touted</a> in a job ad that the next entry in the military first-person shooter franchise would feature the 'most realistic and exciting destruction effects in the industry'. </p>



<p>Now that most fans have already played the game in last month's beta weekends and the full game is only a few weeks ahead, though, it's obvious that while Battlefield 6 does feature well-made destruction, it's not quite as thorough and all-encompassing as in some of the previous installments, such as Battlefield 4's 'Levolution', which gave players the opportunity to raze entire buildings. </p>



<p>Speaking to EDGE in the latest issue (415) of the <a href="https://fave.co/4mquqZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine</a>, Ripple Effect General Manager Christian Grass explained that the developers have opted to implement 'tactical destruction' in Battlefield 6, as being able to destroy everything during matches could harm the game's fun factor. </p>



<p><em>We love the spectacle of that destruction – it looks awesome, sounds awesome, it’s really cool. But we want it to serve a gameplay purpose. If you could destroy everything, once there’s nothing left, then the game wouldn’t be fun. In Bad Company 2, it was a little bit more ‘what if you could destroy all these freestanding buildings, without anything remaining?’ </em></p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 uses what we now call the apple-coring system, where we make sure that gameplay spaces always have cover, and are always interesting to fight around. We want people to be flanking by destroying things, to take down a building to eliminate an enemy. We have tanks driving into a building, so that you suddenly have this threat in a place you thought you were safe. </em></p>



<p>Even so, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-improvements-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers better destruction than Battlefield 2042</a>, and it performs better, too. According to the Technical Director of Battlefield 6, this is partly because the developers had to optimize the game for the less powerful Xbox Series S, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game run better on all platforms</a>. We have also learned that console players <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be able to turn off cross-play with PC</a> while maintaining the feature to play between consoles (for example, PlayStation and Xbox users together).</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-now-works-on-steam-deck-delivering-significant-image-quality-improvements.1300110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4 now works on Steam Deck in select games, delivering noticeable image quality improvements in Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> provides a step-by-step guide on how to install AMD FSR 4 on Steam Deck and use it in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both support the upscaler. The installation process is relatively simple, and the small effort seems to be totally worth it, although performance is not the best at the current early stage. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, using AMD FSR 4 over previous versions of the upscaler delivers a cleaner and sharper image, with better detail for elements in the distance, such as buildings. The new version of the upscaler delivers similarly impressive results in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and with a relatively minor impact on performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BREAKING: FSR4 Is Now Working On Steam Deck!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EHLj8L-VUE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although AMD FSR 4 is officially only supported on RDNA 4 GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to run the upscaler on devices powered by previous architectures like the aforementioned Steam Deck and RDNA 3 GPUs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RX 7800</a>. Even without the proper hardware to run the upscaler, it seems like AMD FSR 4 delivers solid results in multiple scenarios, giving owners of older devices the chance to improve the image quality and performance of several titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>



<p>Many of the visual and performance improvements AMD FSR 4 delivers in supported games should make their way to the PlayStation 5 Pro soon with the new version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. According to rumors, the new PSSR version should launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">early next year.</a></p>

            <p>What with all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">countersuits</a> between publishers Krafton and certain former Unknown Worlds executives, you could be forgiven for thinking that "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>" is some kind of arcane courtroom term - a compact way of saying "vicious haggling over withheld bonuses", perhaps. Here's a new developer diary video to remind us that Subnautica 2 is actually an underwater sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. It doesn't have any lawyers in it, but it does have a massive peckish tentacle monster. Set that one up for you, comments thread comedians!
</p><!--more-->
<p>Shared on <a href="https://press.krafton.com/UNKNOWN-WORLDS-REVEALS-THE-COLLECTOR-LEVIATHAN-IN-SUBNAUTICA-2">Krafton's press site</a>, the video introduces the Collector Leviathan, which appears to be a giant squid except it only has four tentacles/arms, not the regulation 10, unless you include all the tiny wiggly ones around its mouth.

<p>Given its embarrassing tentacle deficiency, it's no shock to read that the Collector Leviathan is an "irritable" creature. If it sees you, it will emit a noisy shockwave and jet towards you with body laid horizontal. Then, it will rear up vertical to give you a lovely look at its volcanic split cranium and painterly bioluminescent forehead patterns. Then it will grab you with a tentacle and eat you.</p><p>It's definitely better to be inside a submarine when this happens, but it's even better to not let it happen at all. Hide from the Collector, and it will eventually lose interest and glide away. You can also lure it off by throwing a flare.
</p>
<p>I dread meeting something this big in a real-world aquatic context, but I do like watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJtd9BLCuc">human divers encountering more reasonably sized cephalopods</a>. I hear that octopus arms contain <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/">"partly independent mini brains"</a>, and that they <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/how-octopuses-and-squids-change-color">both deceive predators and court mates</a> using colour changes.</p>
<p>Please put some of that in Subnautica 2, Unknown Worlds. I'd suggest letting players talk to the Collector Leviathan by means of chromophore mechanics, but that would risk aggravating both Edge Magazine and <a href="https://tomscullin.medium.com/the-limits-of-language-wittgensteins-lion-analogy-a2d4baa5bd20">Wittgenstein</a>, and I make it a rule never to piss both of them off at once. Also, now that I consider it, maybe don't give the Collector active camo - the prospect of it sneaking up on me through murky water is quite harrowing enough.
</p>
<p>The video is a tacit reminder from Krafton that there are still "veteran developers" at Unknown Worlds following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the sudden ejection of Subnautica 2 director Charlie Cleveland, studio CEO Ted Gill, and co-founder Max McGuire</a>. It's a 10 minute walkthrough of the Collector's creation that doubles as a dissection of the production itself - transporting us from concept sketches through modelling and animation to the creation of visual effects and AI behaviours.
</p><p>There's a teasing glimpse of a doc from September 2024, created by game designer Louis Karim, which rolls through how the Collector conveys its alertness through posture and sound. As regards some of the game's areas, at least, it will spawn at a distance from the player and despawn when you're sufficiently far away. It's a relief to learn that there's only one present per session, even during co-op. All this is WIP, mind.
</p>
<p>The doc also mentions a couple of in-game biomes, Sparse Plains and Outer Bounds, plus a blurred-out reference to another Leviathan. There's an untitled image of a third creature that looks like a piscine aeroplane. Apparently you will encounter the Collector in the course of "pearl interactions". Perhaps we'll have to crack open giant clam shells while avoiding the megasquid's attention.
</p>
<p>The September 2024 doc will likely be of interest to the Subnautical subredditors who are trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">gauge the completeness of Subnautica 2 from leaked materials</a>. The current pie-slinging match between Krafton's lawyers and those of the departed Unknown Worlds execs hinges on whether or not the game is fit for early access release this year. 
</p>
<p>Krafton claim it needs more time to cook, partly because the bygone Unknown Worlds bigwigs have been shirking their responsibilities, and are only interested in money. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire insist that the game was substantial enough for launch this year, and that Krafton only delayed it because they're welching on a timed $250 million earn-out. I am having more fun thinking about the tentacles.</p>

            <p>As criticism of Borderlands 4's technical performance continues, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has told players to "get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it".</p>
<p>Since Borderlands 4's release last week, Pitchford has been on a tirade on social media <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">in defence of the game</a> calling it "pretty damn optimal".</p>
<p>In his latest post, Pitchford stated every PC gamer "must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing", effectively placing responsibility on individual players to perform their own optimisations.</p>

<p>One player responded "Your product doesn't meet the standards" and said it took days to get the game to a tolerable state.</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you want," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">replied</a>. "The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.</p>
<p>"You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimise your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p>"The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimise to your taste. Would you like help tuning your experience better to your liking?"</p> <div>

<p>Despite performance issues across both PC and console platforms, Borderlands 4 is proving popular. On Steam alone it's reached a concurrent player count of over 304k (though this remains behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>).</p>
<p>The official Borderlands account released some player stats such as items looted and bosses defeated, with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968049883925078218">Pitchford adding</a>: "Holy bananas you guys played a LOT of Borderlands 4 over the weekend. The backend on-line services all held, which is what we hoped would happen!"</p>
<p>It also looks like a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/easy-queasy-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-may-be-coming-to-console">POV slider could be added for console players</a>, following complaints of motion sickness.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> has launched its 1.0 version today, September 17th, ending the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">DRG</a> spinoff’s two-year spell in early access.</p>
<p>Despite some initial umming and ahhing about how a comedy co-op FPS would translate into a single-player autoshooter – if I press the Rock and Stone button and nobody hears, did I say Rock and Stone? – DRG: Survivor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">quickly won me over</a>, thanks in particular to the tension and horde-dodging trickery afforded by its adaptation of the original game’s pickaxe mining. I’ve also had a little go on the 1.0 build ahead of release, and it does indeed feel like the most complete, well-tuned version yet.</p>

<p>The big additions are a new escort mission type, inspired by (yet sadly not also starring) Dotty the Drilldozer from OG Deep Rock, and the Gear system, which provides an alternative to the persistent upgrades shop by rewarding successful runs with equippable clobber. Your bearded exterminator can only don a handful of these at a time, but they grant juicier stat boosts than the upgrades that your cash and minerals will stretch to in the early game, so they’re good for a more tangible power boost.</p>
<p>Per-run, XP-earned weapon upgrades also seem slightly more generous than I remember from various early access builds, and the lower hazard levels (or difficulties, if you’re a smooth-handed leaf lover) are generally more forgiving. That all gives DRG: Survivor a much more welcoming introductory phase, though there are also plenty of nasty mutators in the Anomaly Dives and Lethal Operations modes for danger seekers.</p><p>I, for one, am all about the power spikes, those cackling turnabouts where all your accumulated upgrades finally flick a brain switch from 'run away to survive' to 'run into them to kill.' I still think Vampire Survivors is more forthcoming with these moments, but DRG: Survivor 1.0 is at least more willing than previous versions to let you become a wave-wiping whirligig of bullets and plasma. Good on it.</p>

            <p>My liege, I bring more tidings from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and its Coronations DLC. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">apologising for the add-on "not being up to the standard you deserve"</a> last week, developers PDS Black have released a second patch aimed at smoothing out the edges of in-game oaths that've been causing issues.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">we reported</a> not long after Coronations arrived, it quickly turned into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">another instance</a> of Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">rather stepping in it</a> when it comes to DLC. Negative reception was fuelled both by technical issues with the new oaths rulers can take on ascending the throne, and the fact that the publishers were charging for features that are relatively compact, but also a pretty central aspect of any kingly lifespan.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to PDS Black, it's taken them less than a week to follow up on the promise of more Coronations fixes. Taking a look at the notes for the regal strategy game's freshly-released Update 1.17.1, there certainly isn't a shortage of tweaks, with a bit of balancing and a couple of new features to boot.</p>
<p>Those new additions are "a powerful new event for coronation hosts, allowing you to use your skilled chancellor to break up a neighboring confederation or earn a new vassal or tributary", plus some extra reasons for lovers to be in relationships. I assume the latter includes lines like 'his crown's got like seventy jewels, how sexy's that!' Meanwhile, balancing-wise, zealous characters are now easier to convert to witchcraft assuming their faith's OK with it. The Level six Millet Storage yurt also costs more to build, and "the ‘Divine Marriage’ tenet now has the incestuous trait as a virtue". Say what you want about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, its patch notes are rarely boring.</p>
<p>The rest of the bug fixes include, but aren't limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Consolidate the empire/kingdom’ oath: The requirement now fully checks for the title for which the coronation was held, not the current primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed the requirement for the children having a claim on your primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed decision display issues, fixed wrong law displayed in the selection tooltip.</li>
<li>‘Repent’ oath: One pilgrimage is no longer counted as multiple</li>
<li>Removed the requirements for the oath buildings and replaced them with piety/prestige costs</li>
<li>Character Memories about Coronations are now more reliable</li>
<li>The event ‘Fulfilled Oath’ will no longer display "Consolidate the None" upon completing the Reconquer Oath</li>
<li>Forbid Pope and other Heads of Faith from bringing any demands in the ‘Petitioners’ event chain</li>
<li>Upon losing the last Kingdom title, all active oaths are removed, thus preventing a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>‘Install Claimants’ Oath: The decision now properly requires 3+ claimants installed via wars.</li>
<li>Building Oaths now better display the requirements for buildings in held baronies</li>
<li>‘Shape the Realm’ Oath now has an updated building requirement in the decision window</li>
<li>‘Strengthen the House’ Oath now is fully mechanically resolved upon completion</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/573767838266819604?l=english">the full notes here</a>, sire. This patch should hopefully stop you from instantly forgetting they exist or being distracted by some Popely demand.</p>

		<p>As the nights start to draw in, the wind picks up and the rain start to hammer down at this time of year, you might be looking for something to match the changing seasons to occupy your time. Something a bit cosy, but with some spooky vibes, perhaps? Following on from the success of Strange Horticulture, the focus of Bad Viking’s sequel is shifting from providing distinctive flora to your customers to now trying to provide them with amulets, artefacts and gemstones as Strange Antiquities launches today.</p>
<p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As John and Rob Doncan tell it –&nbsp;the two brothers that make up Bad Viking – there was a heavy degree of what might be described as kismet to creating Strange Horticulture. “We never set out to make a cosy game,” John said, “Rob came home from a dog walk and he’d seen an advert for a gardening company and the word ‘horticulture’ written on it or something. He came home and said, ‘I’ve got something to pitch to you: Strange Horticulture. It’s about running a sort of occult plant shop.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s make that!’ And we dropped everything and was like, how do we make that? What do we do with our budget?”</p>


<p>Those other ideas they were working on, however, provided the basis for this new setting. John explained, “So we were working on a board game like concept and we were working on a point and click adventure game set in our world called Undermere. We were like, ‘Oh, let’s borrow the map idea that we had in our board game, let’s take the setting from the point &amp; click adventure,’ and it all kind of came together. We were just like, ‘Okay, we haven’t wasted the last six months of just kind of creative prototyping and ideas!'”</p>

<p>For many a gardener, a big part of the joy is seeing their garden in full bloom during the summer, of bursts of colour in thick borders, but Strange Horticulture got a little spooky with it. “I guess we liked the idea of your plants being quite sinister,” Rob said, “and they have, you know, unusual properties, but also quite dark properties.”</p>
<p>From there, Nicholas Culpeper’s Complete Herbal as a source inspiration, the 15th century botanist’s book already containing some mysticism and supernatural ideas, and the atmosphere of having the rain pattering on windows, and adding a cat to snooze on the counter –&nbsp;“Which seems like an obvious thing to put in with hindsight,” Rob said, “but it took us a long time to realise that this game needs a cat in it!”</p>
<p>Rob continued, “We knew we wanted to make a relaxed game because obviously it’s kind of like Papers, Please – that’s what we were heavily inspired by – but we find that game extremely stressful and like we were like, okay, let’s go the other way with it. […] Let’s make it relaxed; no timers ever, you go at your own pace.”</p>

<p>Shifting to Strange Antiquities, and there’s a shared tone, but the source material is shifting from to more overtly occult objects and mysticism. John revealed, “When we were researching the game [Antiquities], we went to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which is like this anthropological collection that’s, I’d say, loosely curated, because you go in there andthe glass glass cabinets are full of stuff and they’re all handwritten labels on them, and it’s it’s just really cool. And there’s a whole witchcraft section with drawers to pull out.”</p>
<p>Rob quipped, “It’s basically Strange Antiquities: The Museum, so it’s like the perfect place to go research!”</p>
<p>Strange Antiquities has also been a chance for John and Rob to learn how to present their game better. The customer is now front and centre, while you can browse the shelves that you stuff with artefacts, and the investigation desk now out of view when you’re not using it. Of the quality of life improvements, Rob said, “One of the main things about the game is that there’s quite a lot of text and some of it can be a little bit small. So you can zoom in on every item and then you’ve got this magnifying glass as well that can zoom in, so people shouldn’t struggle too much with that.”</p>

<p>John added, “It’s less cluttered, I think. We put the desk in a section at the bottom, it’s got its whole own screen, so everything’s just a bit bigger. But, I mean, for us, the quality of life improvements are in the gameplay.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken our formula from Strange Horticulture and just added more depth to it. So there’s more detective work, more reference materials, and things like adding an index to the book so you can cross search terms. So sometimes a customer will come in and ask for an item, but they don’t what it’s called or you’re not given what it’s called. Where Strange Horticulture would always give you the name and you would look it up in your book, here they’ll say, “I need it for this” and you can kind of go in your index, look up something and it’ll come back and sometimes you have to even cross reference a couple of times. It’s just like adding to like that detective [feel] where we’ve put breadcrumbs all over the place and you have to try and follow the clues to the right answer.</p>
<p>“The clues are scattered, so some sometimes the clue will be in the text of the book, sometimes it will be in the sketch, in the book, sometimes it will be in your gemstone book, sometimes it will be a symbol.”</p>
<p>Rob chipped in, “And there’s layers for the clues as well. Sometimes there’ll be four or five different things that could point you to an item and, you know, you might only notice two of them, but you’ll still get to the answer.”</p>

<p>Providing the background to these games, helping to lend it a relaxing tone is the soundtrack. For the first game, the brothers leant on buying royalty-free tracks to easily slot in, but that’s changed for the sequel.</p>
<p>Rob said, “We’ve got a composer this time around around. It’s a guy called Ben Young, and we’ve been super happy working with him. He’s great. I mean, he seems to love the creative process and he’s got kind of really into designing the sound and we think he’s done a great job.”</p>
<p>Digging into that process a little, John said, “He gave us like a bunch of existing material that he kind of thought would fit and we kind of found ones that we liked for sort of a sound guide, I guess, and then he went out and he put a few themes together and then we kind of had a collaborative discussion on what we liked, what we didn’t like, if we could go a bit more mysterious, this felt a bit like, I don’t know, too jolly or whatever. And he was super receptive to all our feedback and yeah, eventually we just it just sort of like came together and we were just super happy with it and we wouldn’t have too many notes for him.”</p>

<p>Oh, and of course there’s the all important cat. Jupiter, the moggy with the heterochromatic eyes, provides a suitably unusual fluffy companion to sit on your counter and receive regular petting as your mouse cursor passes them by. Once again, it was Rob’s</p>
<p>Rob told us, “His name, Jupiter, comes from Robin Jarvis’s The Deptford Mice, if you’re familiar with that. We read them as kids and they’re kind of, I mean, they’re really dark for kids books.” Jupiter was the alchemist’s cat in that tale, but John recalled that “Rob went into a shop in Italy and there was a cat on the counter. It was like a tabby cat.” But, as Rob noted, “We also gave him heterochromia –&nbsp;that’s the key feature.”</p>
<p><em>Strange Antiquities is out today for PC and Nintendo Switch, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities">a demo available on Steam</a>, if that piques your interest.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've known from the Steam concurrent player figures that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has had a strong launch</a>, despite the performance issues that led Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share some 'advice' with the community</a>.</p>



<p>2K and Gearbox have stayed silent so far, though. Thankfully, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the analyst firm's initial estimates, revealing that Borderlands 4 has already passed two million units sold across all platforms, and one million on Steam alone (750K in the first week), generating over $150 million in revenue. This also means it beat even Hollow Knight: Silksong, at least on Steam, as well as other hot indies like Peak. Despite the launch of a highly anticipated triple-A game like Borderlands 4, the indie games did very well for themselves, with Silksong and Peak at the head of the pack. Even the original Hollow Knight sold another 205K units last week. Lastly, the South Korean cooperative roguelite game Shape of Dreams also sold nearly 200K units, a big success for the two-man indie development team Lizard Smoothie.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Alinea Analytics report also discusses Dying Light: The Beast, which is out tomorrow after being bumped up by one day because <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techland celebrated the game's one million pre-orders</a>. According to the analyst firm, however, things are a little more nuanced than that. As you might remember, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> started its life as the second Dying Light 2: Stay Human DLC before evolving into its own standalone game. Those who purchased Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition were entitled to two DLCs, so Techland will provide them access to Dying Light: The Beast. Alinea Analytics infers there are about 700-800K of these users, given that the actual Steam pre-orders for the new game are around 100K, and the rest must be pre-orders from consoles.</p>

<p>None of your progress will be transferred to the full release of the game, although there doesn't appear to be an end date for the demo, so you can replay the first area as many times as you'd like to tide you through to the launch date.</p><p>Little Nightmares 3 is the first multiplayer offering in the series, and follows the story of Low and Alone--two best friends looking to escape the haunting Nowhere. While it can be played co-op, you can still play solo with AI controlling the other character. The game releases October 10 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p><div title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3749" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Little Nightmares 3 Mirror Edition | Amazon Exclusive</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$110 | Releases October 10</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon-exclusive Mirror Edition</a> costs $110 and includes all of the digital content found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDTN2KQS,B0FDR7G47V,B0FDR9641P,B0FDR8H4LN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 Deluxe Edition</a> as well as a handful of collectibles.

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> mod lets folks load directly into any of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s boss fights from a dedicated menu, essentially turning the game into a choose your own bottom kicking adventure.</p>
<p>After all, who doesn't crave the ability to deliberately battle the one boss they're actually good at beating over and over again, ego juice coursing through their veins, a roar of sheer powerful ecstacy reverberating around their quarters? Or, you know, you might just fancy some practice ahead of your next full run through the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Regardless, the mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/261?tab=description">Godhome</a> by Cuckson, whose name I'm going to try not to read anything into. They've developed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> boss scene loader, which does what it says on the tin, letting you hop into any big baddie scrap the game has to offer at any time.</p>
<p>They claim that your progress shouldn't be affected, but also warned that the work-in-progress mod "could corrupt your save data" and recommend you use a 100%ed save they've included in the zip file. "While this mod is loaded, no data will be saved, to prevent corruption or loss of progress in case of using on a main save," Cuckson continued. "If you would like to enable saving, please first disable or remove this mod from your plugins folder."</p><p>Once the mod's loaded, the B key on your keyboard should open up a dedicated menu of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">different boss fights</a> you can load straight into, from the Savage Beastfly to Chef Lugoli. You'll be dropped at "the closest point to the boss that can be achieved purely through scene loading", which the modder says is often right next to them, and get straight on with the battle. There's also an option from the menu to load up a "safe zone", where you can do a bit of prep or recuperate in between battles.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It looks like if you've already completed a run through Skong, you'll essentially be able to live in the boss loader menu, warping around to whichever battle you want to face, which in my book makes this a bit different to the existing teleportation mods for the game. The main ones are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/156?tab=description">Bonfire Teleport</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent, which are more focused around making getting around in a conventional Silksong run a lot more convenient in terms of respawns and fast travelling between the established benches. There's also '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/104">Boss retry menu</a>' from Pilout, which lets you retry a specific boss battle right away if you perish during it.</p>
<p>If you want to give Godhome a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with configuration manager</a> framework or head to <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">GitHub</a> if you're not using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d">64-bit Windows</a>. In other recent Silksong news, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">released its second patch into Steam beta yesterday</a>.</p>

            <p>
Many moons ago, I missed my chance to join a weekly Twilight Imperium play session. Missed my chance, or dodged a bullet? Twilight Imperium is an infamously complicated and backstabby boardgame, the kind of baroque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space opera that can swallow up entire days and expose any number of terrible character flaws along the way.</p>
<p>Thank goodness there's now a PC version in the works for Steam, which will at least remove the need to set up the pieces and remember what they do. Here's a trailer.
</p><!--more-->

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5-TK-5JTm4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
It's being adapted by Red Square Games, the Kraków, Poland-based creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slavicpunk-oldtimer">SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</a>. If you've never come across Twilight Imperium before, the gist is that the galactic emperor has popped their clogs and 17 factions are vying to claim the throne.</p><p>"Will you dominate through raw military might, control the Galactic Council with persuasive politics, or outmaneuver rivals with secret objectives and clever deals?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/">asks the Steam page</a>. Me, I'll be pledging fealty immediately to whoever has possession of planet Crisp Bowl.
</p>
<p>
The Steam version is based on the boardgame's fourth edition, and will feature animated 3D tactical space battles. But the better news, I think, is that there will be interactive tutorials and tooltips. Even better, it also supports singleplayer. I don't envy anybody developing AI leaders for a game like this. The multiplayer features include online matchmaking, hotseat, and asynchronous play.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet. If you can't wait - and your index fingers and eyeballs are up to the strain - you can play Twilight Imperium in Tabletop Simulator. Back in 2015, Paul Dean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tabletop-simulator-mods-copyright">interviewed a bunch of tabletop game creators</a> about how they feel about TTS and its copyright-infringing mods.

So far, the game's reception on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> has been more muted, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3180070/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a current peak of 8,248 players</a>. But this is a single-player game rather than a multiplayer title, which may be why it hasn't done as well on Steam yet.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human was developed by a Russian studio called Trioskaz, and it takes place in near-present apocalypse as humanity can no longer survive the intense sunlight during the day. At night, people can come out, but they aren't alone. Visitors--lethal creatures who largely appear to be human--are on the prowl and looking for their next victims.</p><p>The game takes place inside the house of the player's character, as they are approached by people who need help. Some of the people can even help the player survive. But there's always the tension about whether the guests are actually people or simply Visitors attempting to trick players before catching them off guard and murdering their human guests while they sleep. Detecting the subtle differences between humans and Visitors may mean the difference between life and death. Players learn more about distinctive Visitor traits each night through news broadcasts, but some traits are present in both humans and Visitors.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human is currently only available on PC, however, Critical Reflex plans to port it to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will include console-only crossplay, meaning Xbox and PlayStation players can avoid those pesky cheating PC players.</p>
<p>Senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson detailed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042">IGN</a> the online shooter's crossplay options, activated with a simple on/off toggle. Turned on, console players will be prioritised before PC players fill a lobby. Turned off, and only console players will be included across both PlayStation and Xbox. The option is turned on by default.</p>
<p>"We're very confident but also very keen to what crossplay means for Battlefield 6," said Nickerson. "We've gone the extra mile and put in a lot of effort in terms of balancing the inputs, understanding where the inputs lie [not just] in terms of relationship to general play styles but general performance of what they're good at and maybe what they lack."</p>

<p>Cheating is a major issue across online shooters, with PC players being the most likely to cheat. That's why console players often prefer to exclude them, if possible.</p>
<p>Technical director Christian Buhl said Battlefield Studios is "taking cheating extremely seriously".</p>
<p>"Obviously, cheating is much more prevalent on PC than on console, but we are taking a lot of effort, putting a lot of work into prioritising fighting against cheaters," he said. "We've turned on secure boot. We've got Javelin, our new anti-cheat system, which is required in order to play.</p><p>"So, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible. We have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with. That's what I can say. Now, we can never win against cheaters, right? Cheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of - to the health of - the game."</p>
<p>Console players also use aim assist to balance play with PC players using mouse and keyboard for increased accuracy. But aim assist has been "completely redone" from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, said Nickerson.</p>
<p>"We've added aim assist for what we call our 'combat triangle' now - and that's infantry versus infantry, infantry versus vehicles, and vehicles versus vehicles - to give that cohesive experience if you are on controller, compared to, maybe, something that's a little bit easier on keyboard and mouse. So [we're] very dedicated to crossplay, and we're trying to nail it across multiple vectors when it comes to crossplay. It's just such an important aspect for us and for Battlefield 6."</p>
<p>It's all part of the studio's console-first approach. It's this that's led to strong optimisation across consoles.</p>
<p>Buhl explained to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a> the team struggled to get the game running on Xbox Series S due to its lack of memory, with levels crashing. As a result, the team has optimised memory usage in the game which has in turn made the "whole game better and more stable".</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will release on 10th October across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">don't expect a Switch 2 release any time soon</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been long enough since I last played an Ace Combat game that I can remember only two things about Ace Combat. 1) This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXB1W8va3eg">Ace Combat 7 cutscene</a> featuring what appears to be a wavy JPEG of a dog, which the Twitterati all thought was an exasperated animator's joke, but which I understand is <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Cossette%27s_dog">actually a homage to a real staff member's dog</a> who died before the game's release. And 2) you can 'powerslide' by wilfully initiating a stall, which I think might actually be a move from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-haw-10">Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</a>.</p>
<p>Delivery Must Complete sort of builds a whole subgenre around the thrill of powersliding planes. How does it do this? The clue is that "DMC" is also an abbreviation of "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>". Here's a trailer. I promise you there will be no further confusing/upsetting references to dogs.</p><!--more-->

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/">The Steam page</a> calls it "a high speed Acelike Roguelike with SSSTYLE", featuring cell-shaded, upgradeable jet fighters, four procedural locations, and an enemy roster that includes blimps, dragons and mechs. The story blurb suggests that your overall goal is to make a delivery. What's the return postage cost for an exploded Sidewinder these days?</p><p>In Delivery Must Complete, you will: parry missiles, fire bouncy projectiles out of railguns, deal with varying cloud cover, boggle at fantastical terrain flourishes such as floating islands, build a style meter, and call in orbital strikes. You will not: have limited ammo, though you do have to worry about overheating.

            <p>How are you all? It's Wednesday 17th September, somehow, and we're back to gathering the day's gaming news and events as though starting a collection. Oh look - a rare!</p>
<p>Notable games being released today include Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, the Vampire Survivors-like Deep Rock spin-off that I've heard very good things about from some of you. I'm off to go and play some of it now. Any fans?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-telltale-devs-announce-release-date-and-episodic-format-for-their-new-%E2%80%98dispatch%E2%80%99-game.1300008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, AdHoc Studio announced the release date for their upcoming game, Dispatch. The 'superhero workplace comedy' will be released on October 22 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and PlayStation 5, and it will adopt a bi-weekly episodic format, hearkening back to the Telltale days, with two episodes each week (there will be four in total). The studio was founded by several former Telltale Studios developers (including writers of The Wolf Among Us and Tales from the Borderlands), so that makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>In Dispatch, you play Robert Robertson, also known as Mecha Man. After his mech-suit is destroyed in a battle against his nemesis, he is forced to take a job at a superhero dispatch center as a dispatcher, not a hero. Robertson must rehabilitate a group of ex-supervillains, managing the roster, navigating office relationships, while also rebuilding his suit for a shot at revenge.</p>



<p>There is a strategic layer to the game. AdHoc promises that every decision made by the player influences the unfolding narrative, affecting Robertson's relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path his story takes. The strategy map can be used to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Players must balance the risks and rewards as they make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for the team and the city.</p>



<p>Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero has quirks, flaws, and baggage players must navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dispatch features a star-studded voice cast. The protagonist, Robert Roberson, is voiced by renowned actor Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad, Westworld), and players will also find the likes of Jeffrey Wright (The Batman, Westworld, American Fiction), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Resident Evil 6, Overwatch), and Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina, The Last of Us Part II, Marvel's Spider-Man), among others. The full season is priced at $30, and there's a Deluxe Edition priced $40 that includes a digital artbook and four digital comics. PC players can download a demo right now from Steam.</p>

To pull off this controlled descent, players need to press the emote button while bailing and keep holding on to it. According to SurWesley, the Third Eye emote can also enable a slow fall.</p><p>It's possible that this glitch could be removed from Skate in a future update. But since it doesn't break the game, it could be potentially be kept as well.</p><p>Skate allows players to explore four different neighborhoods that have essentially been turned into giant skate parks following M-Corps' decision to abandon the city of San Vansterdamn. The game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already surpassed 78,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, and that number may continue to rise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, TaleWorlds <a href="https://x.com/Mount_and_Blade/status/1967643361222746569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a big Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord beta update (version 1.3). Steam users can access it by switching to the beta branch in the game's library, though the developer warns that game compatibility with previous saves is not 100% guaranteed, and there may be some instability yet.</p>



<p>No doubt many will give it a try, though, as it's a sizable update that introduces many new features. For example, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord now has a proper stealth system for breaking out of prison and taking on hideouts. NPCs can detect player characters through sight and sound and react to movement, noise, bodies, or alarmed allies. They see more clearly when looking down, but struggle a bit to spot movement above them. Light exposure also plays a role, according to TaleWorlds, with shadows and nighttime offering concealment, while areas lit by torches make you stand out. Natural hiding spots such as tall grass and dark corners also provide stealth, and crouching reduces visibility further.</p>



<p>The NPCs will cycle through four states of alertness: Neutral, Cautious, Searching, and Fully Alarmed. This Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord patch also introduces distraction mechanics with thrown objects and noise-making, but some enemies will resist being diverted. Stealth attacks deal bonus damage to unaware targets, and certain weapons allow for crouched melee and ranged strikes. Players can drag bodies to hide them and prevent alarms from being raised. The player character's roguery skill now also impacts the damage dealt by stealth attacks and your speed and noise level while crouched.</p>



<p>TaleWorlds also added a disguise system to complement stealth. Disguise relies specifically on inconspicuousness; suspicious actions, such as running, drawing weapons, or hiding, raise the guards' suspicion. High suspicion triggers a guard investigation. If you break line of sight, the guards will eventually return to their posts.</p>



<p>If you are identified, your cover is blown, and all guards are placed on full alert and initiate pursuit. Escape requires leaving the settlement, and capture results in imprisonment. If you successfully establish a contact, you can explore the town in disguise, including in any future entries.</p>



<p>But there's more, a lot more to this Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord update, including a significant overhaul for diplomacy. Players can now establish alliances between two kingdoms; each kingdom can have up to two alliances, and an alliance will last for one in-game year. Trade agreements can also be arranged and will feature the same format (up to two, lasting one in-game year). There's even a parley feature with enemy-held settlements containing nobles, where you can select who you wish to speak to from the present nobles.</p>



<p>A new ranged weapon, the Slings, has been introduced to the game. They are one-handed and can be used alongside a shield. Morale and retreat systems have been added to battles and simulations, introducing an extra strategic layer.</p>



<p>There are now up to a hundred random events that players can encounter while playing; these are resolved through pop-up menus, and the resulting choices will influence your character's traits, skills, party, items, or gold. Lastly, there's a new Deserter faction and a new Patrol party type.</p>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord is being prepared for its first expansion, War Sails, which will enrich the game with a full-fledged naval warfare system and a new race, the Nords. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in June</a>, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-2-bannerlord-war-sails-dlc-gameplay-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Fall 2025</a>.</p>

And while the battle continues, so too does the struggle to address the bugs that have come up in the game. Arrowhead Game Studios has released a new patch for Helldivers 2, but there aren't many Super Earth-shattering issues this week.</p><p>The details for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 have been shared on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Discord, and most of the bugs are either crash or audio-related issues. Perhaps the most amusing bug placed Helldivers on top of cave structures while reinforcing. There are two Xbox-specific fixes, including the restoration of SDR colors to their proper brightness level and a bug that prevented players from accessing Helldivers user profiles.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> unleashed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">Into the Unjust update</a>, which added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">lot of new content</a>.
