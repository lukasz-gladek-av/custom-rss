            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s Game Awards season, y’all. That special time of the year when we gather together to celebrate video games and the people who make them… by watching expensive commercials briefly punctuated by the odd awards speech or musical performance. For better or worse, The Game Awards is the biggest night on the video game event calendar. But with the way things have been going, lately it’s been more “worse” than it has been “better.”</p><p>Between host and industry hypeman Geoff Keighley’s two video game vanity projects, The Game Awards is older and ostensibly more mature than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">Summer Game Fest</a>. Conceived in 2014 as a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot">celebrate both the people who make and play games,</a> the show has always been part awards ceremony, part commercial product. That idea has been executed with varying degrees of success. (Remember the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/12/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-cringeworthy-of-the-2016-game-awards/">Schick Hydrobot</a>?) But for the last few years, it’s felt like the awards part was increasingly getting in the way of the commercial part.</p><p>That was felt most acutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23992402/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-layoffs">during the 2023 Game Awards</a>. Developers accepting statues were often drowned out by music or cut off by teleprompters asking them to “please wrap it up” after their roughly 30 seconds of allotted time. Muppets and <em>Death Stranding</em> director Hideo Kojima, though, had no such time limits enforced on them, with <em>Aftermath </em>calculating that <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking/#coral_thread">13 acceptance speeches</a> could have fit inside the five minutes Kojima took to explain his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer">game / not-game <em>OD</em></a>.</p><p>2023 was also the first full year into the now endemic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">video game labor crisis</a> that saw developers laid off by the tens of thousands while studios of popular games got shut down. That crisis went by that year’s game awards with no acknowledgement, angering developers further. “I’m incredibly disappointed in Geoff Keighley for his silence on the state of the industry this year,” Monomi Park senior environment artist Dillon Sommerville told <em>The Verge</em> in 2023.</p><div><div><p id="how-to-watch-the-game-awards"><h2>How to watch The Game Awards</h2></p></div><p>On Thursday, December 11th at 5PM PT / 8PM ET the TGAs will be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/d-BDeU3R5ic?si=XC2AGGmUKLrak3rH">YouTube</a>. This year, Keighley has also signed a deal to beam the show live <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/the-game-awards-adds-prime-video">via Prime Video</a> where it’ll be free to watch for Prime subscribers.</p></div><p>Keighley, perhaps responding to the bad optics, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley/">acknowledged the continuing labor issue in 2024</a>. The Game Awards also introduced a new category, Game Changer, with its inaugural award going to Amir Satvat, a business development director at Tencent who created a resource to help laid-off developers find jobs.</p><p>But in the months since the 2024 awards, Keighley has once again been accused of poor treatment of the people he’s supposed to be celebrating. In 2020, The Game Awards <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-game-awards-announces-inaugural-future-class">announced a new initiative called The Future Class</a>, designed to celebrate game makers, “who represent the bright, bold and inclusive future of video games.” Inductees are honored during the broadcast and provided with networking opportunities, mentorship programs, and other resources throughout the following year. However, there have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">reports</a> alleging that Keighley has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23993630/game-awards-2023-developers-react-future-class">ignored Future Class concerns</a> and that resources from the program have been materially lacking.</p><p>In 2023, the Future Class wrote an open letter to The Game Awards and Keighley demanding recognition of the war in Gaza. This wasn’t without precedent. In 2022, the awards show acknowledged the war in Ukraine. But Keighley didn’t respond to the letter, nor has he mentioned the Future Class that much either. The Game Awards hasn’t named a Future Class in the last two years and won’t be naming anymore according to Future Class organizer Emily Weir. “At this time, we are not planning a new Future Class for this year and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class,” she said <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">in a statement to <em>Game Developer.</em></a></p><p>Like a lot of diversity and inclusion-minded programs, Future Class got started in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020. But as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become publicly verboten in the rise of the Trump Administration and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">the online right</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340846/meta-disbands-diversity-dei-team-charged">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/google/607012/google-dei-hiring-goals-internal-memo">companies</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/838079/microsoft-diversity-and-inclusion-changes-notepad">including game publishers</a>, have diminished or jettisoned their DEI programs. While there has been no explicitly stated reason for the seeming shut down of the Future Class, it seems like The Game Awards is just doing what it always does — whatever’s popular at the time.</p><p>For as much as The Game Awards has lost the veneer of respectability among some of the people whose work it’s meant to celebrate, rest assured, it ain’t going anywhere. The Game Awards broadcast nets millions of viewers <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/tga-shatters-viewership-records-154-million-livestreams">with a record-breaking 154 million livestreams in 2024</a>. That’s a lot of eyeballs that <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">developers pay a lot of money to get in front of</a>. And even for those who don’t buy airtime, having your game featured at all during the presentation can net a big boost in sales. After <em>Balatro</em> was nominated for and won multiple awards last year including best debut indie, its publisher PlayStack <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/486246/balatro-mobile-sales-game-awards-2024/">shouted out the awards specifically</a> for contributing to a huge increase in players.</p><p>More generally, the awards also provide a nice focal point for the disparate online gaming communities to gather around… and bitch about. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">E3 is long gone</a>, and the other big events (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/689708/summer-game-fests-best-games-were-small-and-personal">not also run by Keighley</a>) are the publisher-specific direct livestreams. With everything so fractured now, yelling with your friends or colleagues about how <em>Hades</em> was robbed for game of the year (an event I will <em>never</em> get over) is fun and something TGAs are singularly suited to provide. It is not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075044/dice-awards-video-game-developers-awards">the Oscars of gaming</a> — DICE, the BAFTAs, and the International Game Development Awards (IGDA) pretty well take care of that. But if you want popularity, production values, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards">Flute Guy</a>, there’s nothing like The Game Awards — even though some of the shine is starting to wear off.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-falls-to-record-low-works-with-rog-ally-x-legion-go-macbook-and-more-2000652271</link>
            <guid>1379524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a few years ago, Valve introduced us to a brand new way to play PC games with the advent of the Steam Deck. Sure, they just copy-pasted the Nintendo Switch, but the key difference here is you can play your Steam games on it. This kicked off a wholly new class of product with the PC gaming handheld. Taking your PC games with you on the go is something we’d only been dreaming of a decade ago. That kind of versatility is great for gamers. If you are a proud owner of Steam Deck, you can make it even more versatile with a Steam Deck dock. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">This one from UGREEN offers a lot of flexibility are is right now discounted down by 35%. Normally the dock goes for $46, so this ends up shaving off $16</a>. You only need to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Playing handheld with the Steam Deck is great. I mean, of course it is. That’s the thing it’s designed to do. However, maybe you don’t always want to play on just the 7.4-inch screen. Maybe you want to hook it up to your 65-inch screen in your living room. The Nintendo Switch can do that. So what about the Steam Deck?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>Well, the UGREEN docking station will allow you to connect your Steam Deck to an external display like a monitor or smart TV and be able to play in 4K at up to 120Hz. That kind of visual fidelity isn’t possible when playing handheld. Even with the best model, you’re only getting a 1280 by 800 resolution in up to 90Hz.</p>
<p>This docking station powers your Steam Deck while its sitting in place over USB-C. It utilizes 100W PD charging to provide fast power to your gaming handheld. That makes this dock not just great for playing your games on the big screen, but just being your Steam Deck’s home when you’re finished playing. This way each time you reach for it, you know it will be at full charge.</p>
<p>The dock also has two USB-A ports, great for connecting a wired controller. You can, of course, always choose to use a wireless controller instead over Bluetooth. It connects to a display over HDMI. It also has a built-in Ethernet port so you can maintain a fast connection when playing online multiplayer or just hoping to download a big game super fast. The port is capable of up to 1,000Mbps.</p>



<p>The UGREEN docking station stands apart from other third-party docks on the market because of its overall design.</p>
<p>It can fold up for easy storage. This also makes it practical to take it with you while traveling. Game handheld while on the plane and then go full screen with the TV when you reach your Airbnb.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the viewing angle of your Steam Deck. This is great for using the Steam Deck as a stand and playing off that like a Nintendo Switch in Tabletop Mode.</p>
<p>Under the docking station are a series of non-slip silicone. This adds stability so the dock won’t slide around inside or on top of your media center. It’ll stay firmly in place while you game.</p>

<p>Arrowhead’s CCO has stated that they have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been receiving a whole lot of updates recently, focusing on performance and optimisation. Most recently, the developers made significant progress in reducing the PC file size, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing it down by 85%</a>. Now, it seems they might have something big cooking towards the content side as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-rogue-lite-mode-will-change-the-game-fundamentally">Helldivers 2 Rogue-Lite Mode Will Change the Game Fundamentally</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-arrowhead-is-apparently-working-on-a-roguelite-mode-that-fundamentally-changes-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the CCO at Arrowhead, Johan Pilestedt, was recently asked about a roguelike/endless mode for Helldivers 2, which would allow players to battle against endless waves of enemies while working on completing objectives on the same map. To everyone’s surprise, Pilestedt responded on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998824312401187274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they already have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode that will fundamentally change the game. No other details about this game mode were revealed. </p>



<p>Pilestedt has been providing a lot of Helldivers 2 details on X recently. His recent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998864084197073309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> had an image of four directors having dinner at a restaurant with the caption, “with the directors, talking about Helldivers 2 next 4 arcs. Any hot takes? When asked where it will take 3 years to deliver these arcs, Pilestedt responded, stating they will “deliver a bit more often than that” moreso now as they are “in a better technical space”. </p>







<p>In other news, the Helldivers film has added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-film-director-fast-and-furious-it-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast and Furious director and IT writer</a>.

Indeed, their statement ends with the suggestion that "all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors" that Shenmue 4 should be made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted to set the record straight for all those who think it might still be half real," JustAFan1 wrote. "It's not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many of you will want to hang me for dashing your hopes, but know this was not done out of malice, but love for Shenmue. I realize I went about it the wrong way, and I apologize for that. But I hope all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors that Shenmue is very much alive and profitable if approached correctly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As proof that they were the creator of the video, JustAFan1 posted a link to a new version of the trailer with additional music and footage, along with a lengthier apology statement in both English and Japanese. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to be absolutely clear: I am merely a fan of the series and have absolutely no professional or personal affiliation with Ys Net, nor have I ever had any," this statement reads. "The creation and release of the trailer, which presented itself as an official piece of promotional material recorded behind the scenes, was a lapse in judgment. I take full responsibility for this action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shenmue 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">JustAFan1's statement continues by confirming that the fake trailer's story elements were made using publicly available lore and common fan theories about where the Shenmue series might progress in future, with nothing that specifically reflected any real development that may or may not be underway within Ys Net. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While my intent was centered on a positive outcome, the method I chose to achieve it was misleading and unprofessional. I deeply regret creating and sharing information that was not factual, and I understand the negative impact this misinformation had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The sole purpose behind creating the 'Shenmue 4' trailer was to demonstrate the sustained and substantial market demand and community enthusiasm for this beloved series," the video statement concludes. "I meant no harm to Ys Net, its brand, or its loyal fans. My motivation was to champion the series and help encourage its continuation, not to mislead or create distress."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the statement has been mostly supportive, with many agreeing that the trailer had created fresh buzz for the franchise amid hope for confirmation of a new game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nah, you're good," fan hyo_razuki replied. "I knew it was fake from the beginning but it was fun and you generated some enthusiasm for Shenmue, so no biggie, no need to apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, it's unknown if a fourth major Shenmue game will ever get made, though the franchise's fans certainly hope it happens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yu-suzuki-talks-shenmue-4-air-twister-and-40-years-of-game-development">Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki told IGN in 2023 that he wanted to create a fourth game at some point</a>, though he is currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-as-most-refined-version-of-ryo-hazukis-epic-journey">still working on an enhanced version of Shenmue 3</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead is working on a roguelite mode, the studio’s boss has revealed, although there's no guarantee it will actually come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director, Johan Pilestedt, responded to a fan on social media <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998824312401187274" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to say</a> “we have a prototype of a roguelite mode — it changes the game fundamentally!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That casual reveal has already set fans of the explosive co-op action shooter into overdrive imagining how a roguelite mode would work in the game, which revolves around open and shut missions restricted by time limits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Going to be us defending the Evac from endless patrols but the bird never shows up,” suggested one fan. “Wave complete. Choose a booster to add: Reinforcement budget, flexible budget, discount budget (reinforcing multiple teammates takes up only one call in),” suggested another. And here’s another take: “I think it would be cool to add that… a mission that has no helldiver limit, or no time limit with a limited amount of reinforcements… and just defend a fort from wave after wave of enemies, and we get rewarded based off of how many waves of enemies we can eliminate before time runs out, or the amount of reinforcements runs out…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pilestedt has only so far confirmed that a prototype for this mode has been built, so it may never come to fruition. But given Pilestedt mentioned it in a post on social media — already viewed over 120,000 times — you’d like to think the developers are confident it will eventually see the light of day.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2: Python Commandos Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, Arrowhead will continue to update the game for some time to come. Helldivers 2 is just coming off its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-500-arrives-with-an-incoming-message-from-high-command-thats-already-got-players-worried"><u>big 5.0.0 patch</u></a> as well as its jungle-themed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-finally-getting-a-minigun-and-other-fan-requested-weapons-as-part-of-the-jungle-themed-python-commandos-warbond"><u>Python Commandos Warbond</u></a>, which adds a number of fan-requested weapons including a minigun. In September, the studio’s CEO confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/think-runescape-arrowhead-ceo-rules-out-helldivers-3-will-keep-updating-helldivers-2-for-as-long-as-it-can-go">Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now</a>, saying that instead it wants Helldivers 2 to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape. And then there’s the Helldivers 2 movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-call-for-the-helldivers-movie-director-to-play-the-game-at-least-once">which is picking up steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a subsequent tweet, Pilestedt posted a picture of a meeting with the Helldivers 2 directors to discuss the game's next four arcs, which one fan joked would take a few years to work through. Of course there will be plenty more coming to the game in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Warhammer 40,000 fans think they know — and one eagle-eyed viewer even spotted what looks like concrete evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sega-owned strategy specialist behind Total War: Warhammer (the fantasy version of Games Workshop's much-loved tabletop setting) is rumored to be working on a Warhammer 40,000 and a Star Wars take on its long-running Total War series, and it looks like the Warhammer 40,000 game will finally get announced at The Game Awards tonight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Knavbot took to the Total War subreddit to point to a blink-and-you’ll miss it reference to 40K in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-creative-assemblys-total-war-25th-anniversary-showcase">Creative Assembly’s recent showcase livestream</a> (the one where the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-medieval-3-announced-as-the-rebirth-of-historical-total-war-new-total-war-game-to-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards">announced Total War: Medieval 3</a>). I really do mean blink-and-you'll miss it because the files labeled 40k are incredibly hard to spot.

Assuming this is all leading to a Total War: Warhammer 40,000 announcement, we can assume the game will release for PC as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, the announcement won’t come as much of a surprise for many Warhammer 40,000 fans given the sheer volume of rumors floating around Creative Assembly and the Games Workshop community in recent months.

</section></header><section><p>A couple of months ago, Sega released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> for the Switch 1, bringing a generally solid kart racer that gave Mario Kart a run for its money. Yet, what held it back from greatness was the overall poor performance, whether you played it on Switch 1 or via backwards compatibility on Switch 2, with each system having its own visual quirks that led to a generally subpar experience. Fortunately, Sega has now put out a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> that comfortably fixes the graphical and performance problems.</p>
<p>So, what exactly does the new version bring? Along with a slew of post-launch balance adjustments, some new Gadgets, and an online ranking leaderboard for the truly elite players, the headlining new feature is improved performance across the board: 1440p resolution docked and 1080p resolution portable, with a smooth 60fps for either mode when playing single player or two-player split-screen. This all comes in addition to the mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">free</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-dlc-now-available">paid updates</a> that have been steadily releasing, adding new characters like SpongeBob and Joker to the lineup.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:188438 @ 1765458004 -->
<p>As you’d expect, the resolution and frame bumps make this feel like a new game in certain respects, as the whimsical art style and madcap action now pop in a way that the choppy frame rate and blurry resolution couldn’t do justice. Sega clearly did more than just a simple up-res job, too. I noticed many textures have been replaced with more detailed variants and there are more environmental details like foliage that help to liven up the area around the main road.</p>
<p>With this version, I’d honestly say that Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects. Though there’s no half-baked open-world mode to really drive home the comparison, the tight mechanics, smartly designed tracks, and a wealth of content all come together to make for a pretty compelling alternative, even if there’s a certain classic quality to Nintendo’s evergreen kart racer that’s hard for any other company to emulate. And also, it’s <em>really</em> weird that SpongeBob and Patrick don’t have any voices.</p>
<p>All told, I’d say that this version is certainly worth the punt if you’re invested in playing this on Nintendo platforms - the Switch 2 Edition fixes the issues that were holding this game back from being truly great. Unfortunately, owners of just the Nintendo Switch won’t benefit from these optimisation improvements, but if you already own this game and have a Switch 2, the $10 upgrade feels like a reasonable price to pay for such a notable leap over the old version. I’d suggest picking this up, if only to experience what a great kart racer <em>not</em> made by Nintendo can be like.</p></section></article><div><p>Mitch has been a fan of Nintendo ever since he got his start on the GBA in 2005.

            <guid>1379476</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems are common, but they don’t have to hold you back. If your current devices are overflowing with files, media content, and projects, it’s high time you grab a spacious external hard drive to get things moving again.</p>
<p>Depending on the capacity you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but not today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">The WD 6TB portable external hard drive for PC and Mac is going for $137 at Amazon right now, after a sweet $33 discount</a>. It’s spacious enough to house all your important data, and the compact size makes it easy to carry your entire library with you, wherever you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stores All Your Important Files</h2>
<p>This portable drive works with both Windows and Mac. It comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1, meaning you can just plug it into the USB 3.0/2.0 port of your device using the included cable to start transferring your files; no additional drivers needed. Users of Mac and other operating systems will need to reformat it manually, but the process is fairly straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Once all is set, you’re going to enjoy fast transfers, even when moving large files around.</p>
<p>It’s great for both work professionals and creatives looking to offload heavy stuff that’s taking up a lot of space on the internal drive. The 6TB capacity is quite spacious, and easily capable of housing thousands of high-resolution photos, hundreds of old and new videos, massive creative projects, long research papers, large office documents, and even your favorite gaming titles. We won’t say it’s a forever storage solution, because our needs will grow faster than you think, but it’ll still take you a long way before you need to upgrade again. Think at least a couple of years, unless you’re trying to create an unusually large creative or gaming library.</p>



<p>Its compact size and portability are another strong selling point. It sits nicely on your desk without taking up a lot of space, and slides into any backpack easily, without bulking things up. You’ll be able to take all your important stuff with you on the go; just plug it into your laptop or a remote desktop when you’re out and about, and access whatever you need instantly!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">On a regular day, this drive would run you around $170, but the current 19% discount drops it to just $137.</a> It’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in the last 30 days. If 6TB is more than what you need, there are several other configurations available, all of which are discounted. For instance, the 1TB version is sitting at just $59. You can also grab the 2TB model for $70, or the 4TB option for $114. Additionally, if you’re someone who deals with large chunks of data for different tasks on a regular basis, it’s also a good time to pick up a couple of these!</p>

              <p>Nintendo has just added a new game to its collection of GameCube Classics for the Switch 2’s Online + Expansion Pack subscription: 3D platform game <em>Wario World</em>.</p> <p>I’ve always loved the very existence of Wario. Antithesis villain characters are woefully underused in the realm of video games, despite those that we’re familiar with being so bloody brilliant. Wario, Shadow the Hedgehog…um… See! Oh wait, there was that Evil Crash Bandicoot that one time, right? But where’s a goatee-wearing Joel Miller who sides with the infected? Or a mirror world of mustachioed Pokémon, looking to capture human trainers in silver, spiky balls? (You know what the real problem is? In trying to think of examples for this dumb joke, I realized that nearly all video game leads these days are already antiheroes, which sucks.)</p> <p>Wario is the perfect platonic example of an antithesis character, the result of flipping an ‘M’ upside down and the pure evil that results. Yes, I have enormous love for Waluigi, but Wario is the OG. And let’s be honest, “Waluigi” is a semantic stretch. “Wario” is so clever not just because it invokes a Mario from the Upside Down, but because <i>warui</i> (悪い) literally means “bad.” No notes.</p>

 <p><em>Wario World</em> was the gold-loving monster’s first outing that wasn’t on a handheld. (Wario jokes at the start of the game that “I’ve always been stuck in those liquid crystal displays, but not anymore!”) While not made in-house at Nintendo—instead by Treasure, the team that brought us&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em> and <em>Bangai-O</em>—it was clearly inspired by the design of <em>Mario 64</em>, albeit with a fixed camera, but with a much greater focus on combat.</p>

  <p>And it was good! Not great, not a <em>Mario</em>-like game-changing event, but a good, solid and extremely busy action-platformer. However, the concerns on its original 2003 release are somewhat lessened with the passing of time, not least the contentious nature of its brevity and price.&nbsp;<em>Wario World</em> was a premium game, but over in eight hours, and that sucked. But in 2025, when it’s the latest addition in a subscription pack you most likely pay for so you can play Switch games online, that issue becomes far less important. The retracing your steps and over-reliance on boss fights will still irk, but hey, it&nbsp;<em>feels</em> like it was free.</p> <p><em>Wario World</em> joins <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-ZERO GX</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, <em>Mario Smash Football</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> in the GameCube Classics collection. Still to be added but said to be coming soon are <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Colosseum</em>.</p>

The deluxe edition provides players with four exclusive outfits, a new weapon skin for Bond’s trademark handgun, and a ‘Gleaming Skin Pack’ that equips 007’s earbuds, lighter, pen, and mobile phone with a gold skin. The game’s release date is set for March 27, 2026.</p>

The D-pad sports a healthy radioactive glow, and several other design elements replicate the Valued-Added Targeting System from Fallout. Beyond that, this is a standard Xbox wireless controller.</p><p>It's still the same design that was introduced five years ago, with textured triggers, tactile face buttons, and a very clicky D-pad. These controllers can be powered by AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack sold separately; they're equipped with an audio jack for wired headphones, and their ergonomic design still makes them very comfortable to use for long stretches.

            <p>Last night, Japanese singer Koda Kumi gave us all a live performance of Real Emotion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy 10</a>-2, and immediately transported me back to 2003.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 10-2 was the first mainline game in the series to receive a sequel, and its opening song - performed by protagonist Yuna along with returning character Rikku and new face Paine - has proven popular ever since.</p>

<p>I have always found great enjoyment in the Final Fantasy series, with 8, 9 and 10 especially playing a key part into my early video game education (I wanted a dog called Angelo for quite a long time when I was little. I also dyed my hair dark with a blonde steak a la Rinoa once).</p>
<p>But one Final Fantasy game that will always remember playing is 10-2, which opens with Yuna transforming from the relatively reserved summoner we first met in 2001 into a fully fledged pop star. The song she sings at the start of 10-2 quickly became my backing track for the year, and I can still recite the lyrics (in English, at least) at the drop of a hat over two decades later.</p><p>So, when I saw a post yesterday saying that Koda Kumi would be performing Real Emotion from Final Fantasy 10-2 on Japanese TV that night, I was flooded with a sense of nostalgia and the desire to have a little bop in my kitchen. For those unaware, Koda Kumi performed the Japanese version and did the motion capture for the Real Emotion full motion video shown at the start of Final Fantasy 10-2.</p>
<p>I hunted the performance down on YouTube this morning, and even 20 plus years later, Koda Kumi has still got it. Watching it made me feel like I was a pre-teen once again (which is no small feat given that these days I regularly crick my back just by getting out of bed).</p>
<p>You can check out Koda Kumi's live performance of Real Emotion in the video below.</p>

<p>More recently in Final Fantasy news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed that the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-team-almost-downsized-clouds-humongous-buster-sword-to-make-it-more-realistic">once considered downsizing Cloud's iconic Buster Sword</a>.</p>
<p>"How Cloud swings it around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know," the developer explained. "So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword."</p>
<p>Personally, I am glad they decided against this idea.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Starts Offloading AMD Ryzen 7 at an All-Time Low in CPU Clearance Push]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-offloading-amd-ryzen-7-at-an-all-time-low-in-cpu-clearance-push-2000652290</link>
            <guid>1379449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers know that the hunt for the best processors for their rigs usually boils down to speed and cores, and they also know an unlocked processor can be pushed beyond its factory-set limits for maximum performance. A sneaky-good unlocked gaming processor just hit Amazon’s sale shelf — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">the AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT, an unlocked chip ready to be overclocked, is just $183 after a 27% price drop.</a></p>
<p>The next-gen chips bring fatter spec sheets and sexier reviews, but the 5800XT’s 8 cores and 16 threads built on AMD’s proven-winner Zen 3 platform brings a base clock speed of 3.8GHz which can be boosted all the way to 4.8GHz. It’s loaded with 32MB of L3 cache and 4MB of L2, with PCIe 4.0 support, DDR4-3200 memory compatibility, and — very important for a chip that’s going to get a ton of overclocking — AMD’s Wraith Prism cooler to prevent heat-related failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Second Life</h2>
<p>If you’re building your own rig from scratch, the 5800XT is a solid midrange choice to build around, and this Amazon deal makes its price virtually unbeatable. You’ll be saving hundreds of dollars by skipping the next-gen chip and still enjoying power and speed suitable for online gaming.</p>
<p>The ideal shopper for this deal, however, might be anyone with an older and slower PC who’s caught between gutting out another year or two with a subpar machine, or biting the budgetary bullet and going all-in on an all-new machine. The latter choice could run you well into the high hundreds or even low four figures. But by opting for the 5800XT for just $183 and doing a quick, easy swapout, that older machine probably gains years of new life as a much faster and more efficient gaming rig.</p>



<h2>More Than Gaming</h2>
<p>The 5800XT is listed as a gaming processor, and it definitely lives up to that label. But the 36MB of cache is impressively generous, and the 5800XT also supports DDR4-3200 memory, which means it will be able to transder data with the same great speed it games with. Data access speeds are also well above average, so whatever PC you add the 5800XT to will also be more than capable of being a productivity workhorse or media center for streaming and storage.</p>
<p>PCIe 4.0 compatibility on X570 and B550 motherboards is the final piece if the puzzle for this great Amazon deal on the Ryzen 7 5800XT processor, because it future-proofs your new build or revamped PC by giving it compatibility with next-gen components without forcing you to overspend on an entirely new machine or a next-gen processor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">This deal is the best $187 brain transplant you can perform on an older PC</a>, or the best $187 nerve center around which to build an entirely new machine from scratch.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-edition-announced-so-yes-you-can-play-bethesdas-rpg-yet-another-way-before-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition would be arriving on Switch 2</a>, complete with faster load times and enhanced resolution. Along with a gameplay trailer, the developer also shared a playful live-action trailer which focused on Santa's elves getting ready for the festive season.</p>
<p>One of these elves, unfortunately, messes up a bit, and loses Santa's all important list. So, in a bid to save Christmas, another elf suggests giving everyone Skyrim on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Santa is pleased with this idea, proclaiming "you son of a cup of cocoa", as the elf's speech increases to 27.</p>

<p>Anyway, some online have now suggested that this moment in the live-action Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition Switch 2 trailer is actually a little clue for Elder Scrolls 6. "Speech increased to 27… Elder Scrolls 6 confirmed for 2027?" reads one reply on the trailer. "RELEASE DATE CONFIRMED FOR TES VI    20+27 = 2027 " another exclaims.</p>
<p>Some have since said this theory "isn't too far fetched.. because.. why would they [choose] those numbers in particular for level and speech skill level". Why indeed…?</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself below. Do you think it is teasing a 2027 release date for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 has certainly been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">having first been announced back in 2018</a>. Last month, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off"</a>, though its development is now an "everyday thing". Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Howard didn't rule out the possibility of adapting The Elder Scrolls for TV</a>, though the studio exec added he was "willing to say 'no' for a decade", like he did with Fallout.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2e02f1b572090"><a title="Jaws LRG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e02f1b572090/jaws-lrg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Limited Run Games has announced a <em>very exciting</em> enhanced version of 1987's NES "classic", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/jaws">Jaws</a> - and they've got their signature offering of flashy physical editions ready to devour and everything.</p>
<p>These new physical editions of the game come complete with the 8-bit original, now with modern conveniences such as quick save. But, of course, the star turn is a "massively expanded" Jaws Enhanced Edition that embiggens the adventure to incorporate aspects from four (!) of the Jaws movies, rather than just the good one.</p>
<p>With pre-orders opening on 19th December and ending on 18th January 2026 over on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/jaws-retro-edition-bigger-boat-edition-switch-ps5?variant=44839204585525">official Limited Run Games site</a>, the game is set to be released as part of celebrations "culminating in the 50th anniversary of the blockbuster Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg film, and this time there’s no escape." We'll see about that, chief. We'll also update you folks with a solid release date when we have one.</p>

<p>Originally published by LJN back in 1987, you commandeer a boat (don't worry, it's plenty big enough) in order to hunt down a selection of nasty sea-dwelling enemies, including, of course, that great big rubber shark that terrified audiences so badly back in the days when this writer was still rocking a shark-repellent nappy (bet Batman doesn't have one of those).</p>
<p>Here are some more details on both physical versions that will be up for pre-order, alongside some screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jaws Retro Edition Features:<br></strong>Save Anywhere<br>
Rewind<br>
Achievements/Trophies<br>
Music Player<br>
Gallery</p>
<p><strong>Jaws Enhanced Version Features:</strong><br>
Massively expanded, multi-chapter adventure filled with nods and homages to all four Jaws films<br>
New quests and objectives<br>
New abilities and weapons for your boat and diver alike<br>
More challenging enemies, and more ways to deal with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard version is $34.99, while $99.99 will get you that bigger boat with a "NES-inspired box", a CD (game) soundtrack, a shark lamp, and a couple of other bits.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the original NES game, the excellent Jeremy Parish (who happens to work at Limited Run these days) covered it in his excellent NES Works series several years ago.</p>

            <p>Reader, I must apologise for the intolerably wholesome nature of RPS of late. My last couple of reviews were of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">a laidback farming sim</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/routine-review">showcase of nostalgic hardware</a>. Glancing down the news feed, I note with outrage that Oisin has recently been writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/match-delightfully-silly-hand-drawn-dogs-in-dogpile-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-take-on-suika-game">Very Good Doggos</a> (being thrown into pits), while Mark has been spilling ink over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">that least offensive of politicians, Keir Starmer</a>. Time to consign Starmer, the doggos, and those fetching Macintosh-me-dos to the waste bin along with my lingering fondness for Dreamcast-era platformers. Let's cleanse our palates of sugar with a post about stinking murderous zealots. For you see, there is now a demo available for Band Of Crusaders, the new tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Polish developers Virtual Alchemy and publishers NCSoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
These aren't the crusaders your great-great-etc grandparents hopefully neither joined nor had to run away from back in the 12th century. They live in a very Witchery France that is being consumed from within by many-armed abominations, towering arch-demons, sigil-ridden cultists and... bandits. 
</p>
<p>
I did get a chuckle out of <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kxu4xg5fx3gi6dwjlgfws5hw/bafkreianzgimybybt7reciurxievyfirm3ltldyada3hpnlelzobqirty4@jpeg">this image</a>'s casual equivocation of the likes of Beelzebub with ordinary human thieves. We all remember that line from Revelations, right? "And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. Also there were some guys in hoods who stole my favourite cow. The crowned beast I can live with tbh, but I'm in the cheesemaking trade and I really needed that cow."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. You stroll around a real-time overworld in tabletop figurine form, steadily consuming resources and periodically entering your campsite to re-equip your hairy devil-dingers, level them up, and send them off to the infirmary as needed. There are quests with fairly extravagant historical fantasy writing. These take you between cities with trading facilities and a range of smaller locations, such as monasteries. While sallying forth to the latter, you will likely encounter another, opposing figurine, plunging you into a separately loading smaller real-time battlefield, where men in metal hats bellow and belabour each other with clubs and greatswords. Or sickles and pitchforks if that's all you can afford.
</p>

<p>
Thing I like: the impression of a world steadily succumbing to a demon blight. Cities have cult activity bars; I imagine you'll have a hard time buying more grain and furnace parts if the major hubs are totally overrun. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">Kingdoms mode in Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, with your party striving to prop up farflung settlements. Thing I'm indifferent on: the real-time combat seems fine, with much seemingly depending on choice of weapon: a sword won't bust up plate armour like a hammer. The weapon categories accompany a pinwheel of unlockables that skew towards roles such as tanking, DPS, etcetera. It's sturdy enough, but nothing mindblowing.
</p><p>
Things I dislike: the repetitive combat barks and the fact that all the French-accented English voice staff sound like hastily recruited exchange students. Also, I don't get the sense that this is particularly mindful of the mayhem associated with real-life Crusades; based on 30 minutes, anyway, it seems pretty free and lemon-squeezy with the "deus vult" stuff that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">has proven popular among the latter-day alt-righteous</a>. The choice of otherworldly opponents can naturally be read as dodging the association with religious pogroms and persecution.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because I could really go for a horror tactics game that investigates the ugliness of the crusader worldview, and/or leans into the garishness a la Red Hook's work. Perhaps that's where the full version of Band Of Crusaders will take us? It's not impossible. I'm not sure all of my Brothers in Fiend-Bashing are the saintly sort. My hooded advisor gives off a certain brimstone vibe. I don't like the way he looks at my cows. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526570/Band_of_Crusaders/">Steam</a>.

              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM.

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Free Title Update 4 lands on December 16, 2025, introducing a new Elder Dragon, new equipment, features, events, and more. </p>



<p>Capcom had announced a Monster Hunter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase</a> earlier this week, which was not only going to take us through the details of title update 4 for MH Wilds, but also new information on MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. The showcase was delayed to December 11 due to a tsunami warning in Japan, and is now available as a VOD. </p>

There’s new Armor Transcendence as well, allowing hunters to upgrade their HR 100+ armours even further.</p>

            <p>Annapurna has released another trailer for musical RPG People of Note, giving us a full listen to its big musical number, as well as a fresh look at its turn-based combat.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an RPG with rhythmic turn-based combat and big musical numbers, and I can't wait to play it once it's out.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a corgi shaped like an accordion!</p>

<figcaption>People of Note | Under the Lights Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81CMqRkjUTM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note was first shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-next-three-games-are-a-turn-based-musical-a-zelda-like-adventure-and-a-puzzle-game-exploring-a-utopian-society">Annapurna's showcase back in September</a> alongside the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>This new trailer gives a deeper look at the game. There's protagonist Cadence singing catchy pop-musical number Under The Lights (its chorus reminds me of Rewrite The Stars from The Greatest Showman), with singer <a href="https://lexxemusic.com/">Lexxe</a> providing vocals. Cadence is on a quest for stardom, apparently, and recruits an ensemble of musicians to back her.</p><p>The trailer description also promises each battle will be "a musical performance with evolving combat conditions and genre-bending mashup attacks". We see glimpses of this in the trailer itself, with rhythmic button presses triggering attacks - though without in-game music it's hard to tell exactly how this will work.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Just look at this little guy! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also see more of the game's world - a mix of fantasy and cyberpunk presented in colourful animation. It looks like there'll be exploration and puzzle solving along with combat and extensive music videos.</p>
<p>It's looking brilliant and could be the Kpop Demon Hunters of gaming if it takes off on its release next year, across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>I just hope combat lives up to its potential. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 raised the bar this year for turn-based combat</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-greek-melodrama-fails-to-reach-lofty-expectations">2023's Stray Gods</a> attempted a melodramatic musical but didn't quite deliver on its genre-mixing promise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush, however, proved how intoxicating a musical animated world can be</a>, so let's see if People Of Note follows suit.</p>

<p>Are the upgrades worth it?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> is out now for the Switch 2, delivering an updated version of the acclaimed Wild West romp. We've already provided our own glowing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 review</a>, but now the lovely chaps at Digital Foundry have gone into even more depth as to what you can expect from a graphical and performance point of view.</p>
<p>Starting off with performance, Red Dead Redemption runs at a mostly stable 60fps, with minor dips present in Armadillo and Blackwater, particularly when playing the <strong>Undead Nightmare</strong> add-on. For the most part, however, you can expect lovely, smooth gameplay with very infrequent interruptions.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the visuals, the game's textures and world design remain pretty much the same as those found on Switch 1. However, while docked, the Switch 2 version utilises DLSS to achieve a much more detailed 1440p resolution from a native 720p. There's much less flickering going on with the foliage, while objects off in the far distance have reduced aliasing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 2D assets such as the in-game map are much more detailed thanks to the higher resolution, while shadows appear slightly more realistic than on the original Switch. There are still a few lingering issues, mind you. Some textures still flicker and pop in slightly, which Digital Foundry notes as "disappointing" given the age of the original game, while shadow quality in handheld mode is noticeably worse when compared to docked.</p>
<p>To be honest, the issues mentioned seem so minor, that it's unlikely to cause any issues for the average player. With a nice boost up to 60fps and much improved resolution thanks to DLSS, it seems Red Dead Redemption on the Switch 2 has proven to be a huge success.</p>

            <guid>1379398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Expression Games has shared a first look at gameplay from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, the studio’s large scale multiplayer sequel set to release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/05/hell-let-loose-review-ps-plus-ps5-xbox-series-x/">the WW2 original</a>, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam jumps to 1973 and one of the other most significant wars fought in the 20th century. Much like the original game, two teams of 50 players will fight for supremacy, but this time will be tramping through the jungles, boating up and down rivers and flying over the trees of Vietnam. You can absolutely see the game’s visuals are looking to capture the way that this war was represented in cinema, though I’d hope to see a little more variety in the time of day so it’s not always so sunset-y.</p>
<p>Fresh gameplay additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S next year, but you can check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August. I said, “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.”</p>
