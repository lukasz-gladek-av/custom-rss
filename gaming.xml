			<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-franchise-announcement-hinted-at-by-bethesda-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of clues recently</a> that the announcement of the next entry in the legendary <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom</a> series may be forthcoming, and now, a fresh set of rumors have potentially revealed more about what we can expect. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/41814-2doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to dependable insider Tom Henderson</a>, the next big entry in id Software’s franchise is indeed coming soon and will be known as Doom: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Per Henderson, Doom: The Dark Ages has been in development for roughly four years, which makes sense, as Doom Eternal came out in 2020. The game was developed under the codename “Year Zero,” and The Dark Ages subtitle is quite literal, as the game is said to feature a “medieval inspired Doom world.” Beyond that, we don’t know all that much – will the Doomslayer be doing some time traveling? Or, given the Year Zero codename, could this be a prequel, showing an earlier Doomslayer taking on demons in a historical setting? Regardless, it sounds like those who found 2016’s Doom and Doom Eternal perhaps a little samey are in for something a bit different.</p>
<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Henderson rarely misses, and again, multiple reliable sources are pointing toward a Doom reveal at the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June. Xbox has been facing quite a bit of blowback from once-loyal fans, as&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X/S sales flatline</a>, they&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring former exclusives to other platforms</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close studios responsible for acclaimed games like Hi-Fi Rush and Prey</a>. The Xbox Showcase will provide a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first look at the next Call of Duty</a>, and possibly the next Gears title, so adding Doom to that lineup really would make it an exciting show for shooter fans.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase will be streamed on June 9. What do you think? Excited to go medieval on some demons? Or does the concept sound a bit strange?</p>

Throughout the game you’re quizzed by Thwomp twice on the goings on of the game. If you’re paying attention, they aren’t too difficult, but if you’re coming back from an absence or are simply absent-minded, here’s some help.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-chapter-1-thwomp-quiz-answers" data-injectable="false">Chapter 1 Thwomp Quiz answers</h2> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Your first quiz in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> happens early. During Chapter 1, you need to get the Sun and Moon stones from Shhwonk Fortress. You’ll meet an ornery Thwomp who will hand over the stones if you can beat his quiz. You only need to get five correct without getting three strikes.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false">Here are the questions and answers.</p> <p data-characters="65" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false"><strong>Q1:</strong> What’s hidden in Shhwonk Fortress?<br><strong>A1:</strong> Sun and Moon Stones</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true"><strong>Q2:</strong> What do/does one [item] and one [item] cost at the shop in Petalburg? Total!<br><strong>A2:</strong> X Coins.<br>This question sometimes varies. You may want to write down each items cost in the Petalburg shop. If they ask what a mushroom and fireflower cost, the answer is 12. If you get it wrong, you’ll just have to answer another question.</p>

At the end of Chapter 4 of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> and before the start of Chapter 5, there’s a Peach interlude. The crux of it is that Tec has Peach answer 5 questions. The difference here is that rather than quiz Peach on what happened previously in the game, he asks her to deduce what is happening in the story right now.</p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">It’s a very interesting way of delivering exposition.

  <p id="ZzcrR4">The <strong>best echoes</strong> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24163081/wuthering-waves-codes-how-to-redeem-redemption"><em>Wuthering Waves</em></a> will not only make your team stronger, but also unlock new gameplay options for you, and even allow for different team compositions.</p>
<p id="Q83Gai">Echoes are essentially the armor system in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and while they do offer a chance to unleash incredible powers, they’ll also have stats and passive buffs attached to them too. You’ll want to mix and match these to get the right Sonata Effects for your character’s abilities, like boosting Spectro damage on Rover, your main character, and things of that sort.</p>
<p id="gkpWLe">Below, we detail the <strong>best echoes in </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em> and show you where to find them.</p>

<p id="T71MqF">For this guide, we’re going to focus on the raw power of echoes, which means we’re going to be talking about <strong>Overlord</strong> and <strong>Calamity</strong> echoes. At a glance, here are the best echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="S4RC2z">Mourning Aix</li>
<li id="NOFZwd">Feilian Beringal</li>
<li id="VxNT28">Bell-Borne Geochelone</li>
<li id="znNmHX">Impermanence Heron </li>
<li id="Cnj5TW">Mech Abomination</li>
<li id="mbqKnw">Inferno Rider</li>
</ul>
<p id="06hoor">These echoes are the strongest in the game, with a four-cost associated with them — this also means you’ll need to be fairly strong to take them on in the first place, so keep that in mind. You’ll be able to get higher rarities as you level up your Data Bank too, which means they’ll come with bigger stat boosts. You can only have a total Echo cost on a character of 10 to begin with, so picking a strong main echo is essential.</p>
<p id="RBC9QG">Let’s break down why these echoes are the best, and where you can find them.</p>

<p id="WBxZU5">Mourning Aix is a powerful echo that will perform two heavy-hitting Spectro-infused attacks. After dealing damage, it’ll boost the current Resonator’s Spectro damage and Resonance Liberation damage by 12% for 15 seconds, which is a worthwhile buff. This makes this echo an excellent choice for the Spectro Rover, who can deal some pretty decent damage.</p>
<p id="wjqoFt">You can find this echo to the <strong>south of the map near Fallen Grave</strong>.</p>

<p id="u8EDBt">If you’ve gone for the five-star character Jiyan, then you’ll want an Aero echo worthy of them. Feilian Beringal is that echo, and strikes out at enemies when used, performing two hits if it connects. Along with that, it’ll boost your Resonator’s Aero damage and heavy attack damage by 12% for 15 seconds too.</p>
<p id="PLaqf6">You can find this echo to the <strong>south in the Dim Forest region</strong> among the trees there.</p>

<p id="j6jIss">In most gacha games, your main defensive options are healers and shielders. Bell-Borne Geochelone falls into the shielder category. It gets a big boost based on defense, which means it works well with characters like Taoqi who want a lot of defense already. Along with a big chunk of Glacio damage, it also grants a 15-second shield that provides a damage boost and substantial damage reduction.</p>
<p id="VTI10c">The Bell-Borne Geochelone is to the <strong>northwest of the map, just south of the Gorges of Spirits area</strong>. </p>

Taking part in this event grants you some astrite, which is nice, but it also lets you pick an echo. Basically, you have to complete daily missions online to do some summons, and each time you do this you can unlock new echoes. </p>
<p id="uXfsFI">You can also share these with friends, so make sure you’re talking to your mates to share any good ones you all get. There are a lot of options here, and there are no really bad choices as long as you have a rough idea of what to go for. Generally speaking, you’ll want to go for a yellow-rarity echo, because that’ll actually benefit you in-game thanks to the Data Bank experience it gives you.  </p>
<p id="15QaFq">We recommend picking your favorite one from among any yellow-rarity options you’ve unlocked, but if you get lucky, that can still leave you with a lot of choices. Good general DPS choices are the <strong>Violet-Feathered Heron</strong> and <strong>Cyan-Feathered Heron</strong>, along with the <strong>Autopuupet Scout</strong>. For more supportive choices, <strong>Viridblaze Saurian</strong>, <strong>Chasm Guardian</strong>, and <strong>Spearback</strong> are all good options. </p>

As expected, some people are thrilled to see more digital nudity, while others are stamping their feet upset that Shift Up hasn’t given them what they wanted, which is uh, free speech and digital tits. Ya’ll know porn exists, right? (And the people there don’t wear <em>any</em> clothes.)</p><p><em>Anyway</em>, should you want to grab these revealing new outfits, or try on the other new ones which, in my opinion, are far more tasteful, cute, and sexy, read on.</p><h2 id="h122"><a id=""></a>Buy the new outfits from Roxanne in Xion</h2><p>When you fire up <em>Stellar Blade </em>after updating to version 1.003, you’ll see a notice for two new outfits <em>and</em> a new feature that allows you to remain locked on to an enemy after firing at them with Eve’s drone gun thingamajig. </p><p>White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi (which are some rather cute nano threads, honestly) simply need to be crafted at the Repair Console. </p><div><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><p>But the more revealing, and controversial, outfits you’ll have to buy with some Vitcoin. The info-dealing marketeer Roxanne has ‘em in her shop inventory. Midsummer Redhood and Midsummer Alice, outfits which leave very little to the imagination, can be purchased from Roxanne for 10 Vitcoin a piece. </p><figure id="" data-id="daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-recommend-id="image://daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Pictured: Midsummer Alice outfit.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-recommend-id="image://daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been playing <em>Stellar Blade</em> fairly regularly, you’ll likely have enough to grab these items. If not, simply grab some sidequests from NPCs in Xion and head out to finish ‘em. Not only will you get Vitcoin for completing the sidequests, but you’re also likely to come across Vitcoin from opening chests you come across. </p><p>The same is true of the materials you’ll need to craft these threads. The polymer materials can be found in crates scattered throughout the playable areas. Pulsing your drone by pressing the touchpad is an easy way to spot them as you traverse the environment. In general, you should be keeping your eyes peeled for resources and collectibles while playing <em>Stellar Blade</em> anyway.</p><h2 id="h123"><a id=""></a>How to unlock the Neurolink Suit</h2><figure id="" data-id="c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-recommend-id="image://c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1975" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-recommend-id="image://c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1975" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best additions to <em>Stellar Blade</em> by way of the new update is the Boss Challenge mode. Not only is this a fun way to continue to play and get better at the game, but it’s another opportunity to unlock a new outfit for Eve.

At the max rank of 12, players will be spending 7.5 million less gold per item.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to make the main push for Masterworking to be focused on the acquisition of materials, and less focused on needing the gold," Blizzard writes in the patch notes. "We want to avoid the possibility of having the materials available, but needing to take extra time to collect the gold."</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes related to Masterworking coming in the patch include Masterworking unlocking for all characters once it's unlocked by one character and the ability to transmute Masterworking materials directly instead of needing to open a materials cache to acquire them.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-patch-significantly-reduces-cost-of-transmuting-masterwork-materials/1100-6523593/" data-ref-id="1100-6523593">hotfix already addressed Masterworking material trasmute costs</a>, reducing the gold required by millions. Taken together with the upcoming changes, it should be much cheaper overall for players to Masterwork their items without feeling the need to hoard all their gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the Masterworking changes are the star of the patch, there are a few other minor changes as well, like how Hellborne enemies in Helltides will deal additional fire damage come the update, the drop rates for Scattered Prisms will increase, and how much armor a player needs to hit the armor cap will now be displayed via a tooltip on the character stats page.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's Loot Reborn update has gone over well with fans, with some on places like Reddit and Steam commenting on how much more fun it is and stating the game as it is now is how Blizzard's ARPG should have been at release.

            <p>
A new entry in Sony's beloved Astro Bot series is reportedly in development and set to be officially unveiled very soon.
</p>
<p>
That's according to extremely reliable PlayStation leaker Billbil-kun, <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">writing for Dealabs</a>. Word of a new Astro Bot game first surfaced earlier this year via journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grub, but Billbil-kun says the project - in development at Astro Bot studio Team Asobi - is set to be formally unveiled within the next two weeks.
</p>
<p>
Details are limited but it's claimed the new Astro Bot - likely be called exactly that - is partly set in a desert environment and will feature a robot character resembling a fennec fox.

While Billbil-kun is hedging their bets by suggesting an official announcement will arrive within a fairly broad two weeks window, other reports - including <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793156746976039017">one from XboxEra journalist Nick Baker</a> - have been more specific, pointing to a new PlayStation showcase of some description airing next Tuesday, 28th May.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/du-nouveau-a-propos-de-concord-la-prochaine-exclusivite-de-playstation-51320">previously reported</a> Sony was readying to give PlayStation fans another look at FireWalk Studios' PvP live-service shooter Concord "very soon", suggesting that could be another showcase announcement if reports are true.
</p>
<p>
As for Astro Bot, the series has gained a bit of a following over the course of two well-liked games - 2018's PSVR title Astro Bot Rescue Mission and 2020 PS5 pack-in Astro's Playroom - so a return for the little robotic fella is well overdue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163967/gamer-night-how-to-find-time-for-video-games-schedule<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4833Z6">These days, anybody who talks to me about video games hears a key phrase in my lexicon. “Oh, I watched my friend playing that at Gamer Night.” “I have to install it in time for Gamer Night!” “I finally finished it during Gamer Night last night.” Since 2020, my Thursday night has been Gamer Night, and it has changed everything for me.</p>
<p id="lMm1sc">This is not just me bragging about having friends, although I am very grateful to have them. If you were a lonely kid growing up, like I was, you can probably relate to how amazed I feel to have consistent friendships, let alone a yearslong standing commitment to meet up (virtually) with the same group of people every week. You might be thinking, <em>I don’t have any friends who would want to do that.</em> Or you might be thinking, <em>We’re all too busy for that.</em></p>
<p id="oVs1DW">I thought all of those things, too, and not that long ago. Before it became enshrined in my life as a standing weekly commitment (albeit one that any of us can miss, since there are four of us, and Gamer Night is just as fun with three or two), the whole idea of Gamer Night seemed unnecessary and maybe even impossible, scheduling-wise. Before Gamer Night, I had more of a freewheeling approach to playing games. Every now and then, there’d be a cool multiplayer game I wanted to try, and I’d sometimes manage to convince a few friends to play it with me. That would always involve some irritating scheduling shenanigans, and it would almost never happen as often as any of us wanted it to. That was a perfectly fine way to live. But I had no idea how much <em>better </em>it could be.</p>
<p id="gVjTGi">Gamer Night was born in my own life as the result of organizing a player group for a multiplayer game. It started in the fall of 2019, when two friends and I got super into <em>Destiny 2</em>, which has a lot of three-player co-op activities. This led to us trying some raids, which are more high-intensity cooperative multiplayer activities in <em>Destiny 2</em> that require six people and therefore a lot of scheduling coordination. In the end, that was far too much of a lift for us all to maintain, but in the process, we landed on a weekly night for four of us who cared most about the idea of getting together consistently in a Discord voice call and gaming together. We chose to call it “Gamer Night” because it was funny. It stuck.</p>
<p id="6c1MDV">It didn’t take long for Gamer Night to evolve into an even more ideal format. It’s no longer a weekly event for multiplayer games — not necessarily, anyway. It’s still a night for playing games with friends, but that doesn’t necessarily mean all of us are playing the same game. We might be playing four totally different games. Two of us might be playing an <em>Overwatch 2</em> match together while somebody else watches the match and the fourth person plays <em>Elden Ring</em>. Three of us might watch a fourth person playing <em>Dark Souls</em>, offering advice as needed, or just shooting the breeze about our lives. All four of us might not even play a game at all and instead just watch a Twitch stream of a game and talk shit about it. All of these activities are Gamer Night.</p>
<p id="vdmIdP">Perhaps the most important part of this is that Gamer Night is only two hours, at least for me. I show up at 7:30 p.m. and I leave at 9:30 p.m. (Tragically, I have found that if I play a video game too late into the night, I can’t sleep — hence the early sign-off for the sake of my sleep hygiene.) Sometimes my friends start earlier or they end later, and as I said before, sometimes one of us can’t be there. But it almost always happens, because the results are rewarding. The point originally was to have a time to play games together, especially multiplayer games, without the scheduling hassle — but it’s ended up being something that has bonded the four of us together even more than when we started, which is impressive given that we all already liked each other quite a bit.</p>
<p id="HXILwE">And so I leave you with this directive: Schedule a weekly Gamer Night. It’s two hours — it starts when you’re done eating dinner, and it ends before you need to get ready for bed. You’re making the time to play video games, which is fun, but you’re <em>really </em>making the time to be with your friends, which is even better. You won’t regret it. </p>

Then, on May 9, the vibe shifted with the release of two titles that earned themselves a place in the zeitgeist — <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730"><em>Animal Well</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span>. The first, a deceptive Metroidvania from developer Billy Basso is an absolute shock. It’s not that anybody thought the game would be bad, it’s just that nobody realized the game hadn’t revealed its true self. While <em>Animal Well</em> is a typical Metroidvania requiring you to explore the map as you gain new abilities, there are additional gameplay layers that are more puzzle-focused—one is about hunting down hidden eggs across the map, and the other revolves around finding rabbits with the help of other players. </p><figure id="" data-id="1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-recommend-id="image://1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bigmode</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-recommend-id="image://1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>SFB Games’s <em>Crow Country</em> isn’t as groundbreaking as <em>Animal Well</em>, but its loving ode to the puzzle-centric gameplay of the original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503"><em>Resident Evil</em></a></span> offers a different variation on the same theme.<br></p><p>Cut to one week later and Simogo’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></span> helped solidify that May would be a special month. It’s a twisting puzzle box set within a spooky mansion that’s steeped in French New Wave cinema influences. The long list of puzzles require logical leaps on the part of the player and a penchant for looking at problems in unconventional ways. It’s a brain teaser that stretches your problem-solving just as much as it does your narrative comprehension. </p><p>This parade of releases closed out with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194"><em>Paper Trail</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em></a></span> on May 21 and 23, respectively. <em>Paper Trail</em> is a straightforward rush through origami-inspired challenges that task you with folding the in-game map, while<em> Duck Detective </em>is a parody of the noir genre in the form of an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772"><em>Obra Dinn</em></a></span>-like.

For those who like their puzzles a bit simpler and with a side of action, <em>Crow Country</em> is a passable <em>Resident Evil</em> clone. The beauty of <em>Duck Detective</em> is its comedic tone. Finally, <em>Paper Trail</em> is pure mechanical puzzle fodder. That’s a lot of options for fans of the genre itching to sink their teeth into something, and they are all different enough that you can enjoy them all without getting burnt out. And to top it all off, each title is relatively short compared to the dozens of hours-long RPGS that are so often the focus of the AAA scene. <em>Lorelei</em> and <em>Animal Well</em> are the longest and can take closer to 20 hours to finish but the likes of <em>Duck Detective</em> can be finished in an afternoon.</p><p>With June approaching it’s impressive to see how fantastic May’s releases were, especially considering all of these titles are indie games. Even more impressive is that these are just the puzzle games!

<p>Insider Gaming understands that the next game in the DOOM franchise is set to be revealed during this year’s Xbox Games Showcase on June 9.</p>



<p>The game, which has been under the codename/placeholder title ‘Year Zero’ is understood to have the final name ‘DOOM: The Dark Ages’ and has been in development for at least four years.</p>



<p>Last year, I heard of early details of the next entry into the DOOM franchise, which was described to me as a ‘medieval inspired doom world’. While that doesn’t necessarily give much information to go on, ‘year zero’, ‘the dark ages’, and ‘medieval inspired’ starts to paint a vivid picture of where the series could be going next. Perhaps we’ll be taking more of an early look at the Doomslayer’s life during the medieval times? A prequel of sorts?</p>



<p>Earlier this year, rumors began to swirl again about a new DOOM game, following Bethesda’s newly <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">registered trademark</a>, ‘IDKFA’, a well-known cheat code in the series. Last month, The Verge’s Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first teased</a> that DOOM would be making its way to the Xbox Games Showcase, a rumor that we can now independently verify.</p>



<p>The DOOM series has been a tremendous success for Xbox and ID Software. In 2020, a LinkedIn description from an ID Software employee claimed that the game made over $450 million in revenue.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on a new DOOM game? Are you looking forward to a Medieval setting? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

From the beginning, Nintendo has been at the forefront of creativity and innovation in the home console space. Nintendo is known for its vast library of treasured IPs, with many offering the same charm dozens of years later. With so many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming titles</a>, the company is showing no signs of slowing down. Below, we've rounded up every single console Nintendo has ever released. Journey through the ages and discover how Nintendo has continued to push the gaming medium forward!</p><p><em>Looking to save on a new Nintendo Switch or new titles for your system? Be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><em>best Nintendo deals</em></a><em> available today.</em></p><h2>How Many Nintendo Consoles Have There Been?</h2><p>In total, <strong>thirty-two Nintendo consoles</strong> have been released throughout Nintendo's history of releasing games. We've included revision models for both home and handheld consoles, which include brandings like XL and Mini. </p><h2>Every Nintendo Console in Order of Release</h2><h3>Color TV-Game - June 1, 1977</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/color-tv-game-15-cut-out-1716345449193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Color TV-Game line of systems was Nintendo's first foray into gaming hardware and one that you might not necessarily be aware of. These devices were a joint venture by Nintendo and Mitsubishi Electronics, with the latter involved as Nintendo was inexperienced at developing hardware. These systems were a major success at the time and ultimately led Nintendo to divert its focus to developing more gaming hardware. Almost fifty years later, the Color TV-Game's legacy is still felt, with Nintendo invested more than ever in gaming.</p><h3>Game &amp; Watch - April 28, 1980</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/screenshot-19-1623775260430.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo's first foray into the handheld market was with its Game &amp; Watch devices, each loaded with a different game. While you might not think much of it, the Game &amp; Watch series sold over 40 million units worldwide. These devices brought many gaming revelations that are still utilized today, such as the D-Pad in the Donkey Kong Game &amp; Watch. These consoles made a comeback somewhat recently when Nintendo released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-and-watch-legend-of-zelda-edition-review">limited edition models</a> in 2020 and 2021 to celebrate the anniversaries of Mario and Zelda. </p><h3>Nintendo Entertainment System - October 18, 1985</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/nes-1552660016473.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES</a>) is the first Nintendo home console to be released in North America. Known as the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan, this console implemented cartridges to allow users to purchase and play as many games as they'd like on the system. Almost all of the major Nintendo franchises we know and love got their starts here, with series like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. Overall, the NES is one of the most important consoles in video game history, as it established a pipeline for generations to come.</p><h3>Game Boy - July 31, 1989</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/game-boy-1600799758869.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The first true Nintendo handheld video game console is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-boy-games">Game Boy</a>, which released in North America during the Summer of 1989. Game Boy took a major step forward from the Game &amp; Watch, offering cartridges so you could play as many games as you'd like on the system. For many, the Game Boy's most well-known game is Tetris, which was bundled in with the system in every region with the exception of Japan.</p><h3>Super Nintendo Entertainment System - August 23, 1991</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/snes-1600799793659.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-snes-games/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNES</a>) brought 16-bit graphics to a Nintendo platform for the first time. This console was when Nintendo began crafting major evolutions for their biggest series, with games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world">Super Mario World</a>, Donkey Kong Country, and more. Despite launching toward the latter part of this console generation, the SNES still managed to be the best-selling console of this time period with its profound software lineup and generational appeal.</p><h3>Virtual Boy - August 14, 1995</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/07/06/virtual-boy-1625611419819.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Virtual Boy is quite possibly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-virtual-boy-nintendos-most-famous-failure">Nintendo's weirdest console</a>. This portable device was the first ever video game console that could properly display 3D visuals. A mere 22 titles were ever released for the system, with games like Mario's Tennis, 3D Tetris, and Virtual Boy Wario Land among the most popular. Virtual Boy only lasted on the market for one year, with just under 800,000 units sold in its lifetime. </p><h3>Game Boy Pocket - September 3, 1996</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-pocket-1716349909809.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Game Boy Pocket is a smaller version of the Game Boy, featuring a definitive black and white screen instead of the Game Boy's green tinted display. One of the biggest improvements of this release was the new hardware inside that improved the response time of the display on screen. However, with the smaller design, the Game Boy Pocket had a shorter battery life than the Game Boy.</p><h3>Nintendo 64 - September 29, 1996</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/07/21/nintendo-64-1500631268292.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 64 brought 3D graphics to a Nintendo home console for the very first time. This revolutionary device offered two of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-n64-games">most influential titles ever</a> with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. The N64 completely refreshed what the NES and SNES offered, with a bold new controller that featured an analog stick for the first time. N64 is one of the few consoles where Nintendo offered many iconic special editions, with multiple translucent variants available.</p><h3>Game Boy Light - April 14, 1998</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-light-fl-1716350129414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Light is a console you might not be too familiar with, and a large part of that is likely due to it being exclusive to Japan. This Game Boy revision was bigger than the Game Boy Pocket, but added a new backlight so players could play in low-light areas. Ultimately, this change allowed for the Game Boy Light to feature longer battery life than the Game Boy Pocket, with around 20 hours in total.</p><h3>Game Boy Color - November 18, 1998</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/game-boy-color-1538683004317.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Color finally brought color to Nintendo's handheld side, offering a new way to experience portable gaming. The device is backwards-compatible with all Game Boy games, so it was an easy upgrade for many. Some Game Boy games had support for color already, so titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/23/tetris-review">Tetris</a> could be experienced anew with bright and beatuiful colors. With the new hardware inside, hundreds of new games were also released exclusively for the system. </p><h3>Game Boy Advance - June 11, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/08/gameboyadvance-1-1675896557183.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-boy-advance-games">Game Boy Advance (GBA)</a> was the first massive technological leap forward in the Game Boy brand for Nintendo. In a major shakeup to the previous Game Boy models, GBA flipped the device orientation to a horizontal, rectangular shape versus the portrait-designed Game Boy. 16-bit graphics were now available portably, with a major upgrade from the Game Boy's 8-bit graphics support. Of course, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games were also supported via backwards compatibility. This opened the number of games available on GBA into the thousands. </p><h3>Pokémon mini - November 16, 2001</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/hxjrjcvqtrcpgbqm-large-1716352090482.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: GamesRadar</figcaption></figure></output><p>Pokémon mini released in 2001 with a major focus on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-pokemon-video-games">Pokémon games</a> (as the name implies). This device is so incredibly small that you can fit multiple in your pocket. Only 10 games were ever released for Pokémon mini, with just four in North America. Pokémon mini featured a built-in clock function, an infrared port for communication, and built-in rumble. </p><h3>Nintendo GameCube - November 18, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/11/gamecube-1636641945871.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gamecube-games-of-all-time">Nintendo GameCube</a> built upon the success of the Nintendo 64 and followed up with sequels to many of the beloved titles found on the system. Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate are all three titles that shined on the system. GameCube made a major departure from Nintendo's prior home consoles, as it utilized discs instead of cartridges. Additionally, the controller made major improvements from N64, with built-in rumble, analog/digital triggers, and a staggered design for the sticks. The legacy of the GameCube still lives on today, with many of the franchises that debuted on the title more popular than ever. Looking at you, Animal Crossing.</p><h3>Panasonic Q - December 14, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/panasonic-q-1538683004339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/09/panasonic-q-review">Panasonic Q</a> is a collaborative console between Panasonic and Nintendo. This device combined a traditional GameCube with a DVD player, allowing for users to play GameCube titles, watch DVDs, and listen to CDs. Its design is striking, with a stainless steel exterior and a front LCD panel. Due to a steep price point and low sales, the console only lasted two years on the market. </p><h3>Game Boy Advance SP - March 23, 2003</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-advance-sp-1716353293492.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Advance SP (GBA SP) was the first revision of the Game Boy Advance. A major change from the previous model was the hinge design, which placed the screen on the top panel and the controls on the bottom panel. Additionally, the GBA SP featured a chargeable battery and a backlit screen (exclusive to later models), which were both major improvements from its predecessor. Nintendo opted to omit a headphone jack on this model but offered an adapter for players to listen to audio through headphones.</p><h3>Nintendo DS - November 21, 2004</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/nintendo-ds-1600799790019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-ds-games">Nintendo DS</a> was the first unit in the DS line, which marked the start of Nintendo's best-selling console. The DS featured Wi-Fi support for the first time, with a standout clamshell design that expanded upon the Game Boy SP. With two screens, games on Nintendo DS were quite unique, with many developers creating experiences unlike anything on the market previously. The bottom screen was a touchscreen that players could use with the included stylus pen. </p><h3>Game Boy Micro - September 19, 2005</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/game-boy-micro-1538683004320.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Micro was famously revealed by Reggie Fils-Aimé <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/17/e3-2005-meet-game-boy-micro">during E3 2005</a>, with many shocked at the small size of the system. The rectangular design featured a D-pad and two buttons on the front, with Start and Select buttons on the bottom side of the unit. Like previous GBA models, Game Boy Micro was backwards compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, in addition to playing Game Boy Advance titles. Game Boy Micro featured a backlit screen that allowed for adjustable brightness and even lighting across the screen. The system only sold 2.42 million units across 18 months, where production was then ended. </p><h3>Nintendo DS Lite - June 11, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/ds-lite-1600799752097.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo DS Lite was the first revision of the Nintendo DS. This model released just under a year and a half after the initial launch of the Nintendo DS, and it brought a few changes to the fold. First, the DS Lite is slimmer and lighter than its predecessor. The screens are also both noticeably brighter than the standard DS, which made games easier to see regardless of lighting conditions. Lastly, the battery life was much improved on Nintendo DS Lite to allow for more playtime without the need for a charge.</p><h3>Nintendo Wii - November 19, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/wii-1552660016484.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wii-games">Nintendo Wii</a> marked a huge resurgence for Nintendo's home console business, with a unique focus on motion controls that sold many on the system. The unique Wii Remote relied heavily on motion to control the system, utilizing both infrared and digital technology to input motion from all directions. Nintendo released all sorts of accessories for the system from the Nunchuk to the Wii MotionPlus. Wii was backwards compatible with both GameCube titles and controllers, since the Wii utilized optical discs once again. One of the defining software offerings of Wii was Virtual Console, which allowed players to purchase NES, SNES, and N64 titles for digital download.</p><h3>Nintendo DSi - November 1, 2008</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/dsi-1600799753983.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/06/nintendo-dsi-review">Nintendo DSi</a> made a few changes to the Nintendo DS, acting as the second major revision of the model. It added two cameras, one on the hinge inside and one on the outside panel, which were utilized in games and in certain software. An SD card slot was also added to provide additional storage for downloaded games. Unfortunately, the Nintendo DSi also removed the Game Boy Advance slot that was present on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite.</p><h3>Nintendo DSi XL - November 21, 2009</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/23/dsi-xl-1600855226482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/26/nintendo-dsi-xl-review">Nintendo DSi XL</a> was a larger model of the DSi that launched a year after the main model.

Two speakers were added to the top panel to provide better, clearer sound for players, and a bigger battery for longer playtime. With the larger screens, Nintendo DS games were brighter and easier to experience than ever.</p><h3>Nintendo 3DS - March 27, 2011</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/02/22/13-nintendo3ds-1487795926939.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/19/nintendo-3ds-review">Nintendo 3DS</a> was the successor to the Nintendo DS line, offering a wide variety of new features, games, and hardware capabilities. The key feature of 3DS was the 3D capabilities, which were powered by stereoscopy so no eyewear was required. Interestingly enough, this is the same technology that was used to power the Virtual Boy, which only lasted on the market for one year in 1995. 3DS was a massive upgrade from Nintendo DS, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-nintendo-3ds-games">many impressive titles</a> like The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Fire Emblem: Awakening, and Super Mario 3D Land. </p><h3>Nintendo 3DS XL - August 19, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/01/06/3ds-xljpg-886496.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 3DS XL (known as Nintendo 3DS LL in Japan) featured a screen that was 90% larger than the original 3DS. This console retained every feature of the Nintendo 3DS and simply offered a larger screen. Many games were much easier to view with this model, especially with the bottom screen. </p><h3>Nintendo Wii U - November 18, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/18/wii-u-1600452641372.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/30/wii-u-review-2014">Nintendo Wii U</a> was the successor to Nintendo Wii, featuring an all-new GamePad controller. This controller featured a screen and could be used to play titles off of the TV. All previous Nintendo Wii games, accessories, and controllers were compatible with the system. Wii U was Nintendo's first-ever console to support HD, which was a major step up from the 480p capabilities of the Wii. There were some incredible titles released for the system, including Xenoblade Chronicles X, Super Mario 3D World, Splatoon, and Bayonetta 2 to name a few. Ultimately, a combination of poor marketing and confusion led to poor sales of the Wii U, which left Nintendo in a crucial state prior to the launch of Nintendo Switch.</p><h3>Nintendo Wii Mini - December 7, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/wii-mini-1538683004340.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Wii Mini was a smaller, lighter Wii unit that was released at the very tail end of the Wii's life cycle. Wii Mini featured a top-facing disc drive, which was a huge departure from the standard Wii. Additionally, it removed support for GameCube, Wi-Fi connectivity, 480p resolution, and SD cards. This console launched in Canada during December 2012, with releases in Europe and the United States in 2013.</p><h3>Nintendo 2DS - October 12, 2013</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/11/13/r2ds1jpg-f9b629.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 2DS offered exactly what it sounds like - fun, 2D content. This device removed the 3D capability present on 3DS models and instead flattened out the console to a square-like shape. All 3DS titles are playable on 2DS, with all features minus 3D intact. The console did lose considerable sound quality, as the speaker onboard was swapped for a mono speaker versus a stereo speaker. However, with the extremely low price point, Nintendo had to cut costs somewhere.</p><h3>New Nintendo 3DS - October 11, 2014</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/new-3ds-1600799785491.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>New Nintendo 3DS made significant upgrades to the standard 3DS, with new controls, features, and platform support. Nintendo added the C-Stick, ZR and ZL buttons, and NFC support for amiibo with this release. While the New Nintendo 3DS launched across Japan, Australia, and Europe in late 2014 to early 2015, North America did not receive this standard version until September 25, 2015. </p><h3>New Nintendo 3DS XL - February 13, 2015</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/new-3ds-xl-1600799787766.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Released before New Nintendo 3DS in North America, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/21/new-nintendo-3ds-3ds-xl-review">New Nintendo 3DS XL</a> was a larger version of the revised 3DS model. Although the standard model did feature bigger screens than the standard 3DS, the 3DS XL had even bigger displays, which allowed for more immersive games. The New 3DS XL made a major change from the smaller model as it removed the ability to change face plates. Many felt this limited customization, though Nintendo did offer mutliple special editions for players to purchase.</p><h3>Nintendo Switch - March 3, 2017</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/nintendo-switch-1716322594558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-review-2018">Nintendo Switch</a> fully realized the vision of the Wii U and completely propelled Nintendo to the top of the industry once again. The Switch operates as both a home and portable console, with the ability to play games wherever you go. The same grand experiences you were used to on consoles can now be played in a park, on a plane, or in your bed. With arguably the best first party library of any Nintendo console, Switch has seen some of the greatest games of all time be released on it. There have also been quite a few <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-special-edition-nintendo-switches-you-can-buy">special edition Nintendo Switch consoles</a> that have been released throughout the years.</p><h3>New Nintendo 2DS XL - July 28, 2017</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/07/19/new-2ds-xl---button-1500486486400.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/14/new-nintendo-2ds-xl-review">New Nintendo 2DS XL</a> was a major update to the 2DS. Additions for this model included an analog stick, shoulder buttons, amiibo support, and more. 2DS XL also moved back to the signature clamshell-hinge design, which was a departure from the flat panel used for 2DS. This console was also able to play New 3DS titles, which included games like Xenoblade Chronicles 3D and Fire Emblem Warriors. </p><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite - September 20, 2019</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/07/10/screen-shot-2019-07-10-at-95455-am-1562770862571.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/nintendo-switch-lite-review">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> shrunk down the body of the Nintendo Switch, utilizing a 5.5 inch LCD screen. The major change with this model was the removal of Joy-Con, as the controllers are now built-in on the sides of the console. As a result of these changes, the Nintendo Switch Lite is only playable in handheld mode and cannot be docked to a TV. This allowed Nintendo to cut costs and charge $100 less for the Lite model. </p><h3>Nintendo Switch OLED model - October 8, 2021</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/01/nintendo-switch-button-2022-1643705916959.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> debuted alongside Metroid Dread in October 2021. This premium Switch increased the size of the screen to 7 inches, while also adding a new premium OLED panel. In addition to these features, the speakers and kickstand were also reworked for this device. The OLED model released alongside a new dock, featuring rounded corners and a built-in LAN port. </p><h2>Upcoming Nintendo Consoles</h2><p>With the Nintendo Switch in the midst of its seventh year on the market, Nintendo's next console is on the horizon. In fact, current Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">confirmed</a> in May 2024 that Nintendo would reveal details on its next generation console sometime during Fiscal Year 2025. </p><p>This console, referred to by many as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to offer power somewhere between a PlayStation 4 Pro and an Xbox Series S. Additionally, backwards compatibility and 4K support through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-nvidia-dlss-meaning">DLSS</a> are two major features expected to be available. Nintendo Switch 2 will likely release in early 2025 based on multiple reports from this Spring.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

<p data-characters="205" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The World Series of <em>Warzone</em> returns for another year, featuring a $1 million prize pool, and hours of exhilarating matches for fans to tune into. Here is everything you need to know about the competition. </p> <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">In 2023, Activision hosted the first-ever global in-person tournament for <em>Warzone</em>, bringing together the 50 best teams in the world to compete for a chance at taking home a lion’s share of the $500,000 prize pool. The dynamic trio of Biffle, Sage, and Shifty emerged victorious yet have since <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/some-of-warzones-most-dominant-players-may-have-found-their-third-in-another-champion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disbanded</a>. Biffle and Shifty went on to pick up Hisoka, forming one the most exciting teams in competitive <em>Warzone</em> history. All eyes will be on the newly formed team, but there are plenty of other squads to keep an eye on heading into the qualifying stages. </p>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Without further ado, let’s jump right into what fans should expect from this year’s iteration. </p> <h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-2024-schedule-and-where-to-watch" data-injectable="false">World Series of <em>Warzone</em> 2024 schedule and where to watch </h2> <figure data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Starting on May 24 competitors from the NA and EMEA regions will compete in an Online Qualifier open to any trio who wants to compete. From<strong> 9 AM to 3 PM PT On May 24-26</strong>, the 10 best scores for each team will be counted toward their score. The top 68 teams from the two regions will advance to the next stage. </p> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">As for APAC and LATAM teams, they have until <strong>June 13th </strong>to sign up for a 136 trio tournament featuring three rounds of custom lobby matchups. </p>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">There will then be an extended online qualification pathway with a group stage, for which 68 trios will qualify, from&nbsp;<strong>June 4-12</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Some streamers will be live during their own matches, but Activision will also have a broadcast on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty </em>Twitch channel</a>. </p> <h2 id="h-wsow-2024-prize-pool" data-injectable="false">WSOW 2024 prize pool</h2> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true">There will be a <strong>$1 million prize pool</strong> for World Series of<em> Warzone </em>2024. Activision did not reveal how the prize pool will be divided throughout the tournament, but it was confirmed that the <strong>Solo YOLO Winner will get $50,000</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">In addition, Activision also confirmed that the Global Final prizing has been changed to shift more earnings to the top spots. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">WSOW 2024 format </h2> <figure data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Group play takes place over a two-week window with each group playing other groups once in a match featuring five different Warzone rounds. The top performance will be based on total points accumulated during the 15 group play drops. The top 34 teams from group play will play each other in the Upper Bracket, whereas the bottom 34 teams from group play will play each other in Round 1 of the Lower Bracket.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">From there, the top 17 teams will move on to the Quarter Finals. Meanwhile, the teams who didn’t advance will drop in a second round of bracket play. Out of 34 teams, 17 more teams will advance to the Quarter Finals and 10 teams will have one more chance in the Last Chance Qualifier. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">In the Quarter Finals, 10 teams move on to the finals, and the remaining 24 will drop down into the Last Chance Qualifier. In the Last Chance Qualifier, three out of 24 teams for each region advance, and there will be a sixth map offering up a Wildcard Map, where the winner will also move on to the Global Final. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">WSOW Global Final format</h3> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">The World Series of <em>Warzone</em> Global format will use the match point format instead of the previous multiplier-based system. </p> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">the match point format awards one point per elimination and a separate set amount of points based on placement. For example, squads earn 15 points for placing first or 10 for placing second.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">Eliminating the multiplier makes it easier for fans to track how many points their favorite team has. Once a team reaches 100 points, they must win an additional match to secure the victory officially. As a result, multiple teams can reach the 100-point threshold, and winning one final game becomes an intense finish. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/totally-spies-cyber-mission-reunites-the-dazzling-group-on-pc-and-consoles-for-the-first-time-in-15-years.880929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/totally-spies-cyber-mission-release-date-on-pc-consoles/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=totally-spies-cyber-mission-release-date-on-pc-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Publisher Microids has announced that <em>Totally Spies! – Cyber Mission</em> launches on all major platforms later this year, bringing the franchise back to game consoles for the first time in 15 years and allowing players to take full control of the dazzling trio. </p> <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">The game is set to combine adventure and infiltration like only <em>Totally Spies!</em> can, and is framed in the brand new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/totally-spies-video-game-microids-2024-season-7-anime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world of Season 7</a>, which debuted on May 12. This will be the eleventh Totally Spies! game ever made, but it’s been 15 years since the last one, <em>Totally Spies! Mon Agenda Secret</em> was released for Nintendo DS. As a fan, I’m especially excited that this entry is coming to multiple platforms so it can be played on massive screens with the best graphics any game in the franchise has ever had. </p>
 <h2 id="h-totally-spies-cyber-mission-is-a-new-story-set-during-season-7-and-reunite-players-with-their-favorite-characters" data-injectable="false"><em>Totally Spies! – Cyber Mission</em> is a new story set during Season 7 and reunite players with their favorite characters</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Microids</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">The story of <em>Totally Spies! – Cyber Mission</em> follows the three protagonists as they settle into Singapore and Ayia University. But it won’t just retread the tales you’ve seen in the latest episodes. Instead, its story is brand new and set within Season 7, so you’ll recognize characters from the series that the spies have met and understand where it fits in with the wider story arcs. </p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">While the game can be played solo, it’s also built to allow you to play with up to two friends in local multiplayer. I can imagine this making for the best activity after watching all the latest episodes and wanting yet another excuse to enjoy <em>Totally Spies!</em> with your friends. </p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Based on screenshots I’ve seen of the game, the infiltration and adventure sections will have distinctly different play styles that help bring to life the split between Sam, Clover, and Alex’s personal lives and their full-time covert careers as spies preventing all sorts of nefarious villains from enacting their plans.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Microids</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Infiltration missions will force you to stick to the shadows and progress through a series of puzzles and encounters without being spotted. Adventure sections appear to be less linear and encourage you to explore large areas in search of clues while also experiencing the day-to-day life of each character. </p>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">This couldn’t be a decent <em>Totally Spies!</em> game without gadgets, and Microids promise plenty. From the Compowder to the Laser Lipstick, a wide range appears to be included and should be a lot more interesting. The series has always had a way of grounding the crazy gadgets showcased in spy movies in a much more practical way than even James Bond’s Q manages to pull off. I just hope we can arrest people with the Bracelet Handcuffs. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">The game is set to launch for PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31, 2024. That means you’ve got plenty of time to organize a rewatch of every season with your friends before you pick two of them to play through this latest canon story with. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-medallion-guide.880911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/23988015/medallion-locations-chapter-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3Ryskz"><strong>Medallions</strong> are an item added in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a> as of Chapter 5 Season 1, but as seasons have progressed, they’ve been changed. These buffing items are tough to grab and get repeatedly marked on the map, whether it’s through an image of the emblem or a huge <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23752143">golden circle</a>.</p>
<p id="AUrrTX">Below, we detail what Medallions do and <strong>where to find them in </strong><em><strong>Fortnite</strong></em><strong> Chapter 5 Season 3</strong>.</p>
<hr id="H0aN1q">
<h2 id="BxNEfD"><strong>What are Medallions?</strong></h2>
<p id="HX3MVk">Medallions are boss drops that buff you in different ways. The Medallions in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 5 Season 3 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="GJNkn8">
<strong>The Machinist’s Medallion</strong> regenerates shield over time.</li>
<li id="llVBXy">
<strong>Ringmaster Scarr’s Medallion </strong>gives infinite ammo and a small damage buff.</li>
<li id="SN5KCl">
<strong>Megalo Don’s Medallion </strong>gives infinite nitro.</li>

<p id="4XjYhT">Once you get on the battle bus, the emblems for the bosses should appear on your map. If <strong>The Machinist</strong> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24163821/chapter-5-season-3-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s3-t60-power-armor-fallout"><strong>Megalo Don</strong></a> aren’t in their respective POIs, then they’ll be riding around in an envoy with a battle bus and suped-up cars around them. <strong>Ringmaster Scarr</strong> requires you to stay in the <strong>Nitrodome </strong>for a set amount of time before she’ll appear to fight. You can also drive a vehicle through blue rings to lessen the amount of time you need to stay in the Nitrodome.</p>
<p id="7Cd8Ul">To get the medallion, you’ll need to <strong>eliminate the boss NPC holding it</strong>. If the boss you take out is at their POI, you’ll be able to go steal their specialized ride from a locked garage. (Similar to how keycards point you to where the vault is, the medallion will point you to where the car is.)</p>
<p id="SUBqZk">Unlike other NPCs who are pretty easy to drop on and eliminate immediately, these NPCs all have respawning lackies that’ll fire at you once they see you. That said, it may be easier to loot up around the named locations and then head in to nab a medallion.</p>
<p id="SHq2fM">Luckily, the NPCs shoot like Star Wars Storm Troopers (meaning that they aim very poorly), so you shouldn’t have to worry <em>too much</em> about the lackeys. Focus on the boss with a decent gun and you should be able to get a medallion. Note that the boss will replenish its shield frequently, making it an annoying target.</p>
<p id="C4TcVt">If you see an orange or gold circle on the map, this means a player in that vicinity has a medallion, too. You can eliminate that player to take their medallion.</p>

Its amazing art style and evocative musical score are first-class, even if it’s a lot more uneven and esoteric than the crowd-pleasing original.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 4 has introduced a ton of new ways to improve builds, and that includes Uber Unique crafting. In order to craft an Uber Unique, you will need four Resplendent Sparks, which can only be obtained a few ways. Once you have the four Resplendent Sparks and 50 million gold, you can speak to the Alchemist in any major city and go to the Transmutation tab. In that tab look for Transmute Sparks, which is where you can craft Uber Uniques.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is an Uber Unique?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308203" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308203"></a><figcaption>Only Uber Uniques that can be used by your class will be available to craft.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg"></figure><p>Uber Uniques are ultra-rare items that have very low drop rates. These are different from the regular Uniques that occasionally drop in Diablo 4. These items always drop at max item power and have some of the most powerful aspects in the game. Since they almost never drop, only occasionally appearing from some world bosses like Duriel, it will be much easier to craft than get one naturally.</p><p dir="ltr">There are only eight Uber Uniques in Diablo 4:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Andariel's Visage (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander (Druid and Sorcerer)</li><li dir="ltr">Doombringer (Barbarian, Necromancer, Rogue)</li><li dir="ltr">Harlequin Crest (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Melted Heart of Selig (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Ring of Starless Skies (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">The Grandfather (Barbarian and Necromancer)</li><li dir="ltr">Tyrael's Might (all classes)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">How to get Resplendent Sparks</h2><p dir="ltr">There are four ways to get Resplendent Sparks in Diablo 4 Season 4.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Complete the Seasonal Quest</h3><p dir="ltr">The first method is to complete the Seasonal Quest by getting your Wolf's Honor Rank to level 18. You earn Wolf's Honor by completing the related quests and by completing tasks in Helltides. Killing enemies, completing events, and opening Helltide chests all award some amount of Wolf's Honor. At level 18, you are guaranteed to receive one Resplendent Spark as a reward. <strong>This can be done once per Season 4 character, so you can grind Resplendent Sparks by rolling new characters</strong>.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Defeat Uber Lilith</h3><p dir="ltr">Uber Lilith can be fought in the Echo of Hatred in Fractured Peaks. This tough boss battle will require you to be at least level 90 and have a pretty well-made build. If you don't have max armor and resistances, it can be incredibly difficult to survive this fight, especially solo.</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating Uber Lilith the first time in Season 4 rewards both a Resplendent Spark and a random Uber Unique. If you don't like the Uber Unique that drops or aren't happy with the roll, you can scrap it for another Resplendent Spark.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Tormented Bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">In Diablo 4 Season 4, you can summon Tormented versions of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">various endgame bosses</a>. Summoning the Tormented versions require you to be on World Tier 4 and to use an increased amount of summoning materials compared to normal. For example, summoning Varshan usually requires one Gurgling Head, Blackened Femur, Trembling Hand, and Malignant Heart. Summoning Tormented Varshan requires three of each and two Stygian Stones as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These Tormented versions are a higher level and much tougher to fight. Each boss drops one Resplendent Spark the first time you beat it, so if you have an abundance of summoning materials, it's worth doing.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Farm for Uber Uniques</h3><p dir="ltr">The last method available to you is to farm for Uber Uniques by taking on the two endgame bosses that actually have a chance to drop them. Those bosses are Duriel and Andariel, both of which require you to get summoning materials from defeating other endgame bosses. You aren't likely to get Uber Uniques using this method, but it's the only method that is repeatable on the same character. Scrapping an Uber Unique you don't want will reward one Resplendent Spark.</p>

                <p>With rumors suggesting a PlayStation showcase-style event could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-coming-in-may-report/1100-6522349/" data-ref-id="1100-6522349">coming soon</a>, a new report has revealed a game that is said to be getting an imminent announcement. And it involves one of Sony's most recent platforming heroes, Astro Bot.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, developer Team Asobi is working on a new Astro Bot game simply just titled, Astro Bot. There is reportedly a desert-like area or level and one of the new characters introduced is a fennec in the form of a robot, similar to Astro.</p><p>Additionally, the game will reportedly be exclusive to PS5, and not tied to PSVR 2. The game is reportedly going to be revealed within the next 15 days, which could mean it shows up during a PlayStation showcase if one does indeed take place soon.</p><p>Dealabs has had a consistent track record when it comes to insider information about PlayStation. They reported on Until Dawn getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-getting-new-version-of-until-dawn-report/1100-6520579/" data-ref-id="1100-6520579">PS5 and PC versions</a>, and Sony indeed revealed them back in January. Earlier this month, Dealabs reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-version-will-be-revealed-very-soon-report/1100-6523352/" data-ref-id="1100-6523352">God of War Ragnarok would be coming to PC</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, and also reported that more details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/details-on-ps5-multiplayer-fps-concord-coming-soon-report/1100-6523673/" data-ref-id="1100-6523673">Sony's upcoming live-service, Concord</a>, will be revealed soon.</p><p>The first game in the series, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, was released in 2018 for PS4 and PSVR. The sequel, Astro's Playroom, was released in 2020 and came pre-installed with every PS5 console. Both games were critically well-received and Astro's Playroom served as a tech demo for the PS5's DualSense controller.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-developer-team-asobi-currently-working-on-most-ambitious-game-yet/1100-6494652/" data-ref-id="1100-6494652">Back in 2021</a>, Team Asobi revealed that it was working on its "most ambitious game yet" but it's unclear whether the game is referring to this potential Astro Bot one or a completely different project.</p>

<p data-characters="366" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In Chapter 7 of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, the team needs to find a cannon to get to the moon. Apparently, they subscribe to Sparkster and Doomguy’s newsletter. However, when you visit Fahr Outpost, you find that they won’t even admit the cannon exists. When forced to, the mayor will say he requires the okay from Goldbob and General White to fire it.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Goldbob’s location (in Poshley Heights) will probably be fresh in your memory since you left him there during Chapter 6. However, <strong>you probably haven’t seen General White since Chapter 1</strong>, and even then, he doesn’t make a very memorable appearance. You’d be forgiven for overlooking or forgetting him.</p> <figure data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false"><strong>General White can first be seen way back in Petalburg.</strong> He’s pretty in the dumps at that time. However, when you go back there to find him in Chapter 7, he’ll be gone. If you talk to the Koopa Troopa near where he was or Kroop (the mayor), you’ll be told he went somewhere sunny.</p> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">Just a warning: this whole process requires a lot of travel. The quickest and most convenient way to get through it is to use <strong>the collection of pipes directly beneath Rogueport Square</strong>. Each one leads to one of the chapter locales, and it really cuts down on travel time.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">Go to Keelhaul Key. You won’t find him there either. Talk to Pa-Patch, who will give you the next hint on where to go.</p> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="166" data-injectable="false">Next stop is Glitzville. Of course, he’s not there. If you talk to Podler in the Juice Bar, he’ll say he met General White, but he set off to some great big tree.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Go to the Great Tree where the Puni are. Here, you’d expect to have to talk to the elder, but that’s not the case. Talk to the Puni right inside the door. The next hint suggests Twilight Town.</p> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Head to Twilight Town. Talk to the citizen in front of the inn, and you’ll be given a hint that points you at Fahr Outpost; the place where you started.</p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Return to Fahr Outpost. Talk to the mayor. While in conversation, you’ll see General White step out from a building in the background, then turn around and go back in. Go to where he emerged, and you’ll finally be face-to-face with him. He’ll say he was looking for you this whole time but was also given the runaround. He’s willing to help fire you from a cannon.</p>

<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/">upcoming Modern Horizons 3 release</a> looks to spoil players of every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> format. The third iteration of Modern Horizons brings a massive power creep to the Modern format which will certainly shake up the meta that will develop over the Summer.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">On the Commander side of things, MH3 introduces some much-needed support for energy decks, a swarm of new and reprinted Eldrazi, a Lhurgoyf tribal commander that creates tokens of a staple card, and… “everything” counters?! With such creative approaches to the four Commander preconstructed decks, theory-crafting how to build around them is going to be a blast.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-disa-the-restless-jund-black-red-green" data-injectable="false"><strong>Disa the Restless</strong> (Jund: Black/Red/Green)</h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">The first half of Disa the Restless is a “cheat” effect for <strong>Lhurgoyf</strong> permanents. Building a deck (or being the target of abilities) that discards or mills Lhurgoyf permanents will allow them to be played for free. If this was all that Disa had to offer, she could still be considered a fun and viable MTG commander. But the second half of her card is why her deck is named “<strong>Graveyard Overdrive</strong>.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Disa the Restless is capable of generating tokens that are copies of the <strong>Tarmogoyf</strong> card whenever your creatures deal player combat damage. Tarmogoyf is considered a staple card in many graveyard-based decks. As of 2024, there are nine different card types in MTG which makes the maximum power/toughness that Tarmogoyf can be with its ability 9/10. With Tarmogoyf being priced around $10, Disa prints board value every combat phase.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Omo, Queen of Vesuva</strong> (Simic: Blue/Green)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">Shapeshifters are one of the most fun tribes to play with in MTG Commander. Many of these creatures can be inserted into any other tribal deck to enhance their capabilities. <strong>Omo, Queen of Vesuva</strong> and her <strong>Tricky Terrain</strong> precon deck is no exception to this. Omo introduces “everything” counters which cause lands to be every land type or creatures to be every creature type.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">We haven’t been given official rule clarifications for these “everything” counters, but it’s to be assumed that this would allow lands to be considered Urza lands. Combined with <strong>Urza’s Workshop</strong>, this could be one of the best mana generation engines in Commander.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Satya, Aetherflux Genius</strong> (Jeskai: Blue/Red/White)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">As an energy enthusiast,<strong> Satya, Aetherflux Genius</strong> is the commander that I’m looking forward to the most from Modern Horizons 3. Combining energy generation with copying attacking tokens? Count me in. Satya also sports <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-color-combination-names-explained/">the Jeskai mana colors</a> which contain a healthy variety of energy-related cards and many creatures worthy of being copied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The energy archetype in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> had been seemingly forgotten about for years. But with the <em>Fallout</em> energy-based precon released earlier this year and Satya’s <strong>Creative Energy</strong> precon deck, energy players’ appetites can be sated– for the time being.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity </strong>(WUBRG)</h2> <figure data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Representing the Eldrazi, <strong>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity</strong> is a fusion of two titans: Ulamog and Kozilek. Both of these are also included in Modern Horizons 3, but their fused version is the face of the <strong>Eldrazi Incursion</strong> precon deck. This is one of the more complicated commanders out of the four preconstructed decks, but like most Eldrazi decks, it has tremendous potential.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">To make the most of Ulalek’s ability, you’ll need to understand how the Stack works in MTG. This is the order in which spells are resolved based on their type, player priority, and interactions. You could think of this as the order of operations in math.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">Ulalek’s ability requires careful planning from the player to use efficiently. After casting an Eldrazi spell and paying two colorless mana, you can copy just about every type of spell that you control along with new targets for each. This can outright win games when copying powerful triggers or abilities. The tricky part about it is that the copy ability applies to spells you control, which means that these spells need to be cast and currently on the Stack (under your control).&nbsp;</p>

They repeatedly clarify that this will not likely be the logo we see in the final game, comparing it to a few we saw in early promotional material for <em>Persona 5</em>. The placeholder is pretty simple. Its bold, black text is displayed against a green background, with a P6 at the top that is interlocked. But given Midori already claimed the game would use a green color scheme, this image lines up with their previous leaks.</p><p>It’s not much, but fans are so hungry for a new <em>Persona </em>game<em> </em>that Atlus can mine for a decade of spin-offs, anime, and manga that even seeing an asset used during development is at least a sign of life. Though I’m also mostly ready for the next generation of <em>Persona </em>to begin, part of me is a little bummed that we didn’t get what felt like a proper send off for <em>Persona 5</em>’s Phantom Thieves after <em>Royal</em>. <em>Strikers </em>and <em>Tactica </em>were good but lacked the step forward of something like <em>Persona 4 Arena </em>or <em>Persona 4 Dancing All Night </em>for the last two casts. Is it too much to hope for another <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-off as we make the transition? Give me <em>Persona 5 Arena</em>, Atlus.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">100 Thieves CEO Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag and Richard “Ricky” Bengston, also known as FaZe Banks, have made it official after initially agreeing to go up against one another in a Rust match on<em> Modern Warfare 2 (2009</em>). </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The 100 Thieves <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1794035695428006113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Founding Fathers Lan will be held on May 30, pitting three CoD juggernauts against each other in the 100 Thieves, OpTic Gaming, and FaZe. The CEO of each organization will compete in a 1v1 tournament on Rust in<em> Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</em>. </p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">This all started on May 1 when Jack ‘Courage’ Dunlop posed the idea of going up against Banks in a one-on-one on Rust match, and Nadeshot <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1785786363037794566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “Ricky is free cash, brother. The loser has to make the profile picture of all social media handles for their pages chosen by the winner.” </p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">It didn’t take long for FaZe Banks to clap back. “Intervention radar on first to to 20, is an absolute lock,” Banks <a href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1785788383853449683">said</a>. “You won’t touch double digits, papa. Lock it in RIGHT NOW These fools really like to forget.” The saga took another twist when OpTic Gaming CEO Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez also <a href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1785798674783875103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> to enter the competition. </p> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">If this wasn’t already enough nostalgia, Courage <a href="https://x.com/CouRageJD/status/1794037518524174558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he will be casting the tournament, marking his first time casting Call of Duty in seven years. From 2014 through 2018, Courage cast some of the most important matches during the Call of Duty World League competitive era. It’s hard to tell who would be the favorite in this contest. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">Nadeshot has the most experience as a former professional player, but Banks rose to fame creating sniper montage clips in <em>Call of Duty</em>, and H3CZ can always surprise people given his years around the scene. 100 Thieves did not provide a specific time for the event, or how fans can watch. </p>

<p>The actor - who has previously starred in James Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and No Time to Die - will appear as Isaac, the same character he played in the video game version of The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>"We're beyond thrilled that Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast," the game's developer Naughty Dog <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1794037550690259348">shared</a> on social media platform X.</p> <div>

<p>News of Wright's casting comes after HBO shared a first look at Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in the second season of The Last of Us' TV adaptation. </p>
<p>The two pictures (which you can see below) don't reveal a huge amount, but Joel does have his hair grown out in a slightly longer style, much as he did in the game. Ellie, meanwhile, is bundled up in cold-weather clothing, perhaps out and about in Jackson. As for the lights behind Joel, they suggest this is from <em>that</em> community event, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">originally launched on the PS4 in 2020</a> and has already received an update for those playing on the PS5. It’s not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics — which include native 4K support and improved frame rates — are nice, they’re not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it’s all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There’s a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller’s touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it’s nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I’m sure we’ll see some <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I’m 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn’t exist in <em>TLOU</em>’s timeline).</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-987c4708-aa5a-4623-93fc-46f9ce56289f"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cd0b0e1f-f914-4ffa-ba2a-03ff75d856b2"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.

Here are reviews, interviews, deep dives, and more to explore while we wait to see Ellie and Joel hanging out in the post-apocalypse once again.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23636850/the-last-of-us-season-1-tlou-hbo-ps5-game-reviews-interviews">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-0668300d-1e7d-49df-8042-b487bbee042e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638100/the-last-of-us-zombies-season-2-craig-mazin-bloater">The Last of Us future seasons might be swarming with even more infected monsters</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><figcaption><em>A bloater surrounded by clickers in HBO’s </em>The Last of Us<em>.</em></figcaption></p></figure></div><p>The infected were a constant threat throughout the first season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em></a>, but compared to the game, the show didn’t ultimately feature quite as many different kinds of cordyceps-infected monsters as Joel and Ellie made their way to Salt Lake City.

			<p>Today, out of the blue, Ascendant Studios <a href="https://ascendantstudios.com/2024/05/24/amd-fsr-3-and-hdr-updates-arrive-in-immortals-of-aveum/?utm_source=ascendantstudios.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=captivating-technical-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of the much-awaited Immortals of Aveum update that introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-debuts-soon-on-consoles-in-immortals-of-aveum-frame-pacing-improvements-hdr-coming-to-pc-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 3 support on consoles</a>. This is the first time that a console game supports any frame generation technology.</p>
<p>Ascendant Studios accomplished the feat with the help of Enduring Games, an Austin-based studio that co-developed a lot of big titles, including Demon’s Souls for PlayStation 5, Godfall for PS5 and the Epic Games Store, Knockout City for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, the cross-platform play update for Borderlands 3, building the first Unreal Engine video-on-demand application with Crunchyroll for the Nintendo Switch system, cross-platform play support for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, cross-platform play &amp; Nintendo Switch console support for Tribes of Midgard, multiplatform support for New Tales From the Borderlands, retargeting Bugsnax for the Nintendo Switch system.</p>
<p>The Immortals of Aveum update did not just add frame generation to consoles. The PC version of AMD FSR 3 was also updated on PC to improve both quality and performance.</p>
<p><em>AMD FSR 3 uses a combination of super resolution temporal upscaling technology and frame generation to deliver smoother framerates in supported games. This technology uses optical flow technology and temporal game data such as motion vectors to generate additional high-quality frames for a higher framerate. On PC, AMD FSR 3 has been updated to a newer, better version which further improves visual quality and performance of its temporal upscaling.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, this Immortals of Aveum update improves Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support across platforms and displays, which the developer says should improve frame pacing issues and even the occasional tearing issues. Lastly, this patch adds High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support on PC.</p>
<p><em>HDR is one of the IOA community’s most highly requested features and our team shared that desire to bring HDR to Immortals of Aveum. This meant taking the time to make the game look great in both SDR and HDR and balancing work on other unannounced projects. We wanted to provide players with gorgeous HDR visuals, and we’re delighted to offer a richer, more visually captivating journey through Aveum we hope all battlemages will enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Will this be the first of several console games to support AMD FSR 3? We'll have to check the quality of its implementation first to answer such a question. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162798/francesca-bridgerton-lord-kilmartin-season-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xGmD8f">While her siblings get huge, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156775/bridgerton-season-3-part-1-review-netflix-polin-3a">sweeping love stories</a>, Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) is quietly winning the relationship game, actually. </p>
<p id="uJ28RU">The sixth Bridgerton is quite different from her more outspoken siblings. Francesca is reserved and quiet, her primary drive in life is the pianoforte, and she’s most passionate when she’s talking about the nuances of musical theory. Whether the attention is good or bad, she’s not too keen on entering the season. Even when the queen discovers her musical talents, names her as the “diamond” of the season, and thrusts her into the spotlight, Francesca would rather not be here, thank you very much. </p>
<p id="NJ70GC">It’s in a quiet moment away from a crowded ballroom where she meets John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). The two have an immediate connection — one that sparks without either of them sharing a word and instead simply enjoying each other’s company in shared silence. It’s an intimacy that takes many couples years to achieve, yet Francesca and Lord Kilmartin easily fall into it.</p>

<p id="9dMV9F">As a romance show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157362/bridgerton-queer-characters-benedict-eloise-brimsley"><em>Bridgerton</em></a> is primarily concerned with dramatic love stories and grand displays of affection. Daphne, Anthony, and now Colin have all had big, epic love stories — the kind that involve tearful confessions and sweeping declarations of love. But Francesca’s is shaping up to be quieter and more subdued. It’s a lovely contrast from the other romances in the show, and that’s what makes it so special. </p>
<p id="Sq1fT6">“There’s a lot of emphasis placed on passionate love,” showrunner Jess Brownell explained to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/franchesca-bridgerton-hannah-dodd-storyline-book-1235005592/">IndieWire</a>. “Love is exciting and thrilling, but there are other kinds of love that are just as valid and meaningful and deep. And so to explore a relationship for Francesca that is based much more on companionship, friendship, common interests, respect and attraction, but perhaps not in a thunderbolt from the sky kind of way is really meaningful. And I think it’s nice to hold space for that.”</p>
<p id="256QMN">Francesca and Lord Kilmartin’s quieter, softer romance slowly grows in the background along Penelope and Colin’s flashier story, but that doesn’t make it any less romantic. In fact, the most romantic gesture in the whole show isn’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony and Kate’s verbal sparring</a> or Colin’s carriage love confession or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings telling Daphne that he burns for her</a>. It’s when Lord Kilmartin shows up to the ball with sheet music in his hands, arranged just the way Francesca envisioned.</p>

<p id="KA92gn">“We talked a lot in the writer’s room about love languages and how John is an acts of service guy or a gifts guy rather than a words or physical touch guy. And I think Francesca probably has a similar love language. So when he presents her with that music, again, it’s a silent gesture that speaks a thousand words,” Brownell said. </p>
<p id="ce4Kyr">It speaks to just how compatible the two are. Just because there’s no angsty pining or clandestine hookups doesn’t mean that the attraction isn’t there. It just manifests in a different way, one that sweeps quiet and reserved Francesca off her feet but in a way that doesn’t cause her to stumble and fall. <em>Bridgerton</em> has its share of over-the-top misunderstandings and high-strung emotions designed to create the most dramatic plots possible. Having a couple that is stable, solid, and generally undramatic grounds the tempestuous storylines. In fact, a steadfast love like that is something the more dramatic Bridgerton siblings should aspire to — after all, when that red-hot passion cools down, it’s good to have some kindling steadily burning to fuel the rest of the romance. </p>
