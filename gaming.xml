		<p>All children of the 90s love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – or Hero Turtles depending on which backwater country doesn’t allow children near the word ‘Ninjas’. The truth is they’re both heroes and ninjas, and they’re having a very 2020 revival right now, with a series of digital adventures showing that there’s plenty of hero left in those half-shells. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover is the newest game in the canon, but, as the title suggests, this is going to be a very different kind of adventure for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover – I swear, that’s going to be TMNT: TT by the time we get to the end of this news story – takes our beloved turtles into uncharted territory, because unlike recent hits like beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">TMNT: Shredders Revenge</a>, or the rogue-like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>, Tactical Takeover is a turn-based strategy, owing more to games like X-COM or Fire Emblem than it does to Streets of Rage. It’s an interesting idea, and given that the team are one of the most beloved groups in the last thirty years it feels like it’ll pay off. I particularly appreciate the range of experiences that Turtles fans can enjoy right now, and rather than resting on the simple ‘smacking people about’ action that you’d expect, this offers a new cerebral take on the green group.</p>
<p>What’s even better, is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">you can try it out right now</a>, with a demo appearing as part of the Steam Next-Fest. It’s a real blast, and you can stay tuned for a full preview of it in the coming days. The Steam Next Fest demo features a tutorial and a modified version of the first chapter of the game, inviting players to experience the turtle action first-hand as they take on the Foot Clan.</p>


<p>It sounds as though they’re going through some stuff too, with both Splinter and Shredder dead, and the beloved gang starting to fall apart. Hopefully you can keep them together – though not if that’s strategically a bad idea, you need to watch out for area of effect attacks, of course.</p>
<p>The game’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, which is the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., best known for his work as a lead developer on I Am Your Beast, CLICKOLDING, El Paso, Elsewhere, and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. We’re certainly intrigued, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more ahead of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover’s launch on PC later this year.</p>

Shortly after, WB confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement</a>.</p><p>“We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises – <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, DC and <em>Game of Thrones</em>,” WB wrote. “After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's <em>Wonder Woman</em> videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. … As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.”</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon reports</a> that in an email to staff, Perrette, the CEO and president of global streaming and games for Warner Bros. Discovery, said that the company hopes to "repurpose our talent where possible," but as evidenced by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cypheroftyr.bsky.social/post/3lizlkbt2tc2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts from now-former employees</a>, that's far from an across-the-board directive. Perrette went on to talk about "swagger," because these people can never not be nauseatingly embarrassing while also revealing that they do not have souls.</p><p>“We need to and will do better for our fans first and foremost, and also because regaining that credibility is critical to us securing even more investment in Games in the years to come,” Perrette wrote in the email to staff. “Getting our swagger back happens one high quality game release at a time, and our financial credibility gets rebuilt one fiscal quarter at a time – delivering what we said we would deliver, and no big negative surprises.”</p><p>As Stephen Totilo, former boss of both Schreier and everybody at Aftermath, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lizl7ipdg22l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> to cap off this incredibly dour crossover episode, Warner Bros Discovery’s quarterly earnings update is in just two days. Odds are this ritual bloodletting is, as ever, about pleasing the shareholders. IP like <em>Harry Potter</em>, perhaps the least imaginative story ever told about literal wizards, and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, a franchise so tapped that I grow tired just thinking about it, will <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue until morale improves</a>. The studios involved will not, unless they produce infinite hits forever – unless they cause The Line to stand so erect that it tickles God’s own toesie-woesies.</p><p>I’m sure said shareholders will leap into the air and click their heels when they hear that people have lost their jobs, and a legacy that includes <em>Blood</em>, <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, <em>Condemned: Criminal Origins</em>, and <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> has been flushed down the toilet. I do not imagine many of them will linger long on the fact that WB <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-patent-for-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patented Monolith’s incredible Nemesis System</a> – which allowed enemies in the <em>Mordor </em>games to develop personal rivalries with the player and even taunt you with the specific ways they dispatched you – and then failed to meaningfully redeploy it, preventing other game developers from iterating on a mechanic that could have defined an era.</p><p>After all, that is not their job. Their job is to serve, and be served by, The Line. Our job is to slurp slop from the boot heel – to bury ourselves in meaningless nostalgia for boy wizards until we’ve forgotten that human beings are part of this process at all.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/a-manga-about-transforming-into-a-plant-for-the-greater-good"><h3>A Manga About Transforming Into A Plant For The Greater Good</h3></a><p>Fool Night asks if humanity can enrich their hearts in eternal darkness</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>It’s time to put all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">lessons I’ve learned about<em> Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha system</a> to the test. There’s <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/122">a new event coming</a> to the game and with that comes a new outfit I actually want this time. </p></div><p>After the game taught me an unfortunate lesson on the gacha economy, I’ve kinda taken it easy with <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, and have found myself enjoying it way more at a slower pace.</p><p>Updates come about once a month, and when I first started playing, I’d blaze through all the new and shiny quests within days only to spin my wheels at the tail end of the month desperate for something new to do. With that in mind, I slowly worked my way through all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year content</a>, completing everything I wanted mere hours before the event was due to wrap up. It feels like I’ve finally gotten into a steady rhythm with the game. I know how to play and how to spend and I’m happy again enjoying the game for what it is.</p><p>With the flashy fireworks in the distance, I took a look ahead to the next event, Eerie Season, due to start February 26th. It’s an oddly themed update. Typically games save their spooky events for October not March. But the community has been clamoring for more darker themed clothing since the overwhelming majority of the game’s items are pink and pastel so this seems like a response to that. The update will also flesh out the Queen’s Palace Ruins, an area of the game that’s visually interesting with its dilapidated and haunted castle vibe but devoid of any story or quest content. I am interested in poking at the darker bits of <em>Infinity Nikki’</em>s story and the overall lore of the world and Eerie Season seems poised to give me just what I’m looking for.</p><p>One of the things that’s helped me stick to my guns about not spending any extra money is the fact that premium outfits have never really moved me at all. Everything’s cute, of course, but nothing’s made me sit up and go “I must have this!” However, that apathy disappeared the moment I took a look at the premium outfits for Eerie Season.</p><p>I saw that cowboy outfit and audibly cursed. I’m from the midwest, we don’t have cowboys here. I don’t even like cowboys like that but … <em>I must have this</em>. So I’ve decided to apply all the tricks and tips I’ve learned about gacha game to acquiring this one outfit without spending any extra money. I think I’ll be able to do it, too. </p><p>After that rather frustrating lesson on exactly how gacha games can fleece even the most clear-eyed players, I haven’t spent any more money and have ignored the game’s clothing slot machine. As a result, I’ve amassed a small but tidy sum of premium currency, although not enough to get the cowboy outfit outright. After some light mathing, I’ve determined that I’ll need another 4,000 or so of the premium currency (or roughly $15). Thankfully, with what the battle pass and the new event quests will provide, I’m reasonably confident that I’ll have more than enough to get the entire outfit without any extra spending.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I’m excited about it. Not just because I’ll have an outfit that I truly want but also because there’s a thrill to making, executing, and succeeding with a plan. We’ll see how that goes when the new event starts February 26th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire. One deeply frustrating wrinkle in this is that one of Monolith Productions’ greatest claims to fame has been patented by the same company that just shut down the studio.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195922,196345" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>2014’s <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>was one of the best surprises of that year. One of the most notable parts of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> spin-off was the Nemesis system, a clever mechanic that married gameplay and narrative in a way that few games have ever been able to pull off. In short, the Nemesis system tracks your encounters with different Uruk foes throughout the game, and enemies that you face in a fight can be promoted in Sauron’s army, gaining power and rank. What made it so fascinating was that it created micronarratives throughout the game. Instead of facing generic enemies until you hit the credits, you could be facing rivals that grew as you progressed throughout the game. All of this made the experience feel like an emergent, self-authored revenge story reactive to how you played. Monolith further iterated on it in the sequel <em>Shadow of War</em>. In a perfect world, this kind of mechanic would have been copied a dozen times over until teams integrated it into so many games we got tired of seeing it. However, Warner Bros. had other plans.</p><p>After the runaway success of <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, WB started mobilizing to patent the Nemesis system so no one else could use it in 2015 then proceeded to only make use of it one more time with <em>Shadow of War</em> despite plenty of opportunities to integrate it into series like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977"><em>Batman</em></a></span>.

However, given Warner Bros. has done nothing with it, the patenting of the Nemesis system was especially wasteful.

Now the studio that was responsible for what could have been a revolutionary system in narrative design has been shut down and the project that it spent years working on that would have used it won’t see the light of day.</p><p>While it’s hardly the most important thing that’s happened today, it’s a sad reminder that when corporations own your work, it could disappear with a snap of a finger, no matter how brilliant it is. My heart goes out to folks affected by these studio shutdowns, and it especially goes out to those whose creativity is being locked away in a vault that Warner Bros. may never open up again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, another Bloomberg report suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble">Wonder Woman was in trouble</a> after rebooting and switching directors in early 2024. This came amid larger struggles at the company's gaming division, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">layoffs at Rocksteady</a>, the lukewarm reception to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">shutdown of MultiVersus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even more recently, WB Games has appeared to undergo a restructuring of sorts, as long-time games head David Haddad <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">announced his departure from the company,</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2ea08a79-b569-4349-8ee8-993ba5599179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors circulated that the division might be sold off</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, this move represents a blow to WB's DC universe-connected gaming efforts. Notably, just yesterday, James Gunn and Peter Safran <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-couple-years-before-we-see-the-first-dcu-video-game-james-gunn-says-but-first-fortnite">said in a presentation</a> that it would be "a couple of years" before the first DCU video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this closure, the games industry loses three incredibly storied studios. Monolith Productions, which had been working on Wonder Woman, was founded in 1994 and acquired by WB in 2004. It's best-known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War, the former of which pioneered the lauded Nemesis system that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-patent-for-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB successfully patented in 2021</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games, a newer studio established in 2019, was responsible for MultiVersus. The game was well-received critically and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-debuted-as-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-last-month">saw launch success</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">underperformed relative to WB's expectations</a>. WB San Diego, similarly, is a newer studio established in 2019 with a focus on mobile, free-to-play games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These shutdowns continue a trend going back roughly three years of increasing games industry layoffs, project cancellations, and studio closures. In 2023 alone, it's <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated that over 10,000 game developers were laid off</a>. That number shot up to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 14,000 in 2024</a>, and while <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 has seen numerous closures</a>, the exact number of impacted individuals is hazier due to fewer companies reporting these layoffs and shutdowns, or specific numbers affected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 features a similar asymmetrical stick layout to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">8BitDo’s original Ultimate controller that launched in 2022</a>, but adds additional buttons, interactive LED lighting, and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) joysticks that are even more durable than Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p>We still don’t know if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Nintendo will switch to Hall effect joysticks</a> for the Switch 2, but companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">GuliKit have already moved away from them</a> in favor of TMR. The technology has already long been used in hard drives to boost storage capacities. For controllers, it allows for joysticks that draw less power, which can improve battery life while nearly eliminating the risk of joystick drift that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">plagued the Nintendo Switch</a> and other modern controllers before magnetic Hall effect technology was adopted.</p><p>8BitDo is also bringing over the RGB Fire Ring lighting effects first introduced on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325092/8bitdo-ultimate-mini-wired-microsoft-xbox-controller-rgb-lighting">smaller-sized Ultimate C wired Xbox controller</a>. As the branding implies, both joysticks feature a ring of color-changing LEDs around their base with several lighting modes that react to button presses (including the triggers) or the direction the joysticks are being pushed.</p><p>The Ultimate 2’s triggers still use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and reliability, but 8BitDo has introduced a switch that lets you swap their behavior between longer draw triggers ideal for racing games and short pull tactile triggers for quicker responses while playing first-person shooters. And like the budget-minded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2c</a>, the Ultimate 2 has an extra pair of customizable shoulder buttons on the back.</p><p>The controller connects to 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2, which is also available as a mobile app, allowing buttons to be remapped and the sensitivity of joysticks and triggers to be adjusted. The controller has support for motion controls for games that support it, and a charging dock is still included.</p><p>Connectivity options include Bluetooth, a wired USB-C connection, or a low-lag 2.4GHz wireless connection using an included USB-C dongle. But like the cheaper Ultimate 2C, 8BitDo has only made its new Ultimate 2 controller compatible with PCs running Windows 10 and later or Android devices running Android 9.0 and newer.</p><p>Versions of the new Ultimate 2 compatible with the Xbox, iOS, or Nintendo Switch (and presumably the Switch 2) haven’t been announced yet, but 8BitDo previously released <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/">additional versions of the original Ultimate controller</a> with alternate compatibility.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ensemble, led by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709">Grammy-winning 8-Bit Big Band director Charlie Rosen</a></span>, performed never-before-heard rock arrangements of music most people had only heard as chiptune tracks backing up a shovel-swinging hero’s adventure. And yet, there are only two planned performances of these arrangements by this group of musicians. The setlist included selections from the base <em>Shovel Knight </em>game, as well as the DLC campaigns developer Yacht Club Games released. When the show reached its final number, Rosen—in defiance of the posted notices to the contrary—asked the audience to record the rest of the performance, lest the entire show become nothing but a memory for the few hundred fans in the audience. If you were wondering why the only footage from the performance seems to be of the <em>Shovel Knight</em> end credits theme, that’s probably why.</p><p>As a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-show concert series</a></span> with performances only happening in New York and L.A., the potential audience for Shovel Knight Live is limited to people who already live in those cities, and those sickest of <em>Shovel Knight</em> sickos willing to invest the time and money into travelling there for one night. So as wonderful as it is to hear talented musicians reimagining these iconic tracks for a live show, it’s sad only a fraction of <em>Shovel Knight </em>fans will ever hear them.</p><p>And my god, what a show it was. Live performances have a way of making you appreciate aspects of a piece’s composition that you might not even process when listening to it on your headphones, or when it’s playing in the background as you whack people with a shovel in <em>Shovel Knight</em>. Rosen and crew’s rearrangements of composer Jake Kaufman’s original score were incredible reimaginings with guitar, horns, and strings that had me and the rest of the audience popping off in the Town Hall. Hearing a violin soar over the rest of the band had me welling up in my seat. It took me back to playing <em>Shovel Knight </em>on my PlayStation Vita in 2015. The grand sense of adventure and stress I felt when playing some of the more challenging levels flowed back into me after having not played the game in a decade, all punctuated by footage of the game playing in the background of each song.</p><p>Even though I hadn’t played <em>Shovel Knight </em>in years, I couldn’t help but get caught up in the passion in the room. In a previous life, I was studying to be a music teacher before I pivoted into journalism, and I’ve only recently gotten back to music as a hobby. Some of my defining musical projects when I was a semi-professional musician involved rearranging songs so my local choirs could perform them, so I know that breaking a piece of music you love and putting it back together as something else is the kind of thing you only do if you’re passionate about the source material.</p><p>Earlier this year I went to see the <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>orchestra concert, which was an incredible show full of talented musicians, but those were more or less one-to-one recreations of the tracks you’ll hear in the RPG. Maybe it’s the hibernating composer in me hyperfixating on the little details of how a violin or horn section was able to create something new and exciting out of chiptune music, but seeing a group of incredible performers playing <em>Shovel Knight</em>’s music in ways it never had been before elevated the show beyond what might, on paper, just look like an event for diehard fans. It was an exceptional showcase of musical talent and passion of a sort that only a live show can truly communicate. I hope that these first two shows are successful enough that Yacht Club Games gives more people the chance to experience this performance. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis are finally giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> a burglar of its own in a new update that's live on all platforms. The Sims 4's burglar update coincides with the launch of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-businesses-hobbies-expansion-adds-tattoo-artist-career-and-ceramic-incense-burners/1100-6529300/" data-ref-id="1100-6529300">Businesses and Hobbies expansion</a>, though you don't have to buy the new pack to get the burglar. It's a free update for the base game with special interactions if you own certain other expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Maxis included a burglar in The Sims, The Sims 2, and The Sims 3, but never in The Sims 4 until now. Robin Banks, the new version of the criminal mastermind, behaves in much the same way as the burglar in previous iterations. There's a low chance that Robin will enter your residential or business lot at night, and she can potentially make off with anything inside that isn't attached to the structure, such as windows or lights, or that isn't planted in the ground, like your shrubbery. The update also adds a new lot challenge, Heist Havoc, that increases the likelihood of Robin appearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims might wake up, catch Robin, and call the police before she makes off with their property, though there's no guarantee the police will arrive before Robin makes her getaway. Maxis said the only sure way to stop a burglar is to install an alarm, which alerts police as soon as Robin enters the premises. Sims who are good with their hands can upgrade their alarm to keep it from breaking as frequently or even modify it to release an electric charge and stun the burglar. If your Sim is more physically inclined, they can also pick a fight with Robin, though they might lose if they aren't in good shape.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wnGkiBOtM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_wnGkiBOtM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of other Sims 4 expansions include unique interactions for the burglar. For example, if you own the Cats and Dogs pack and have a dog in your house, they might chase Robin out. Vampire Sims can turn Robin into a thrall and command her to leave, while scientists from the Get to Work pack can use a freeze ray to stop Robin. Non-playable Sims, such as Agnes Crumplebottom in the Cottage Living pack, will have their own methods for dealing with Robin.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Maxis said The Sims 4 treats Robin like other special NPCs. You can make friends with her and add her to your household, and if she moves in with you or dies, another, generic burglar will spawn and take up her criminal mantle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Games has shut down three studios, including Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego. This follows the reports that the Wonder Woman game (which is now canceled) <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was in development trouble</a>, not to mention the failure of MultiVersus, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down soon</a>.</p>
<p>Monolith Productions is by far the most storied developer out of all three. Founded in 1994, the studio released games like Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, No One Lives Forever, Tron 2.0, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War games. The latter was the last game they released back in October 2017. At The Game Awards 2021, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a Wonder Woman game featuring an original story and the studio's trademarked Nemesis system seen in the Middle-earth games. However, as mentioned in the aforementioned report, after all these years, the development was still nowhere near ready, and Warner Bros. Games (which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced division chief David Haddad</a>) must have decided to cut its losses instead.</p>
<p>The publisher has released the following statement to comment on the news:</p>
<p><em>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises — Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately, this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. </em></p>
<p><em>This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith's storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</em></p>
<p>Even the outstanding success of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game in 2023, was not enough to offset several disappointing releases for the publisher, including Gotham Knights, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus, and now Wonder Woman. It didn't help that all the studios at Warner Bros. Games, except for NetherRealm and Avalanche Software, seemingly took between six and seven years to release a new game, far longer than the average triple-A title.</p>
<p>It's yet another hard blow to an industry that is facing continuous rounds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio closures</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invincible-ttrpg-by-free-league-brings-superhero-action-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League and Skybound Interactive are working on an official <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG. Several industry veterans will design this tabletop adaptation of the superhero property created by Robert Kirkman, including a producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG will be coming to Kickstarter later this year. The game's initial release will include a Core Rulebook containing everything needed to play and a beginner-friendly Starter Set. Both books will be illustrated by original comic artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley with graphic design by Johan Nohr.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invincible-ttrpg-book-cover.jpg?itok=UjNqeNsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invincible-ttrpg-book-cover.jpg?itok=lcEZqEfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The names attached are noteworthy for who is designing this RPG. The lead designers include Adam Bradford, the founder of the virtual tabletop platform D&amp;D Beyond. Bradford has also produced for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Cortex Prime</em>, and <em>Marvel</em>. The second designer is Free League co-founder Tomas Harenstam, whose design credits include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-alien-tabletop-rpg-hits-shelves-this-december" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Alien RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, and <em>Dragonbane</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of my very first tabletop roleplaying games was the old Marvel Superheroes by TSR, and making a superhero RPG has been a lifelong dream. I think the genre, and Invincible’s more grounded and visceral take on it, is a great fit for the Year Zero Engine game mechanics,” says Tomas Härenstam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, the press release doesn't state what RPG system the <em>Invincible TTRPG</em> will use. Given Free League's history, there's a chance it will use a modified version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Year Zero Engine</a>, the same one used for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis</em></a> and<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-ttrpg-shambles-to-tables-fall-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em> The Walking Dead RPG</em></a>. Given the system's versatility, it is not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Invincible was a comic series created by Robert Kirkman in 2003. It heralded the end of the Dark Age of comic books thanks to its well-written and complex characters, mature but heroic storylines, and a complex superhero world unburdened by decades of history or the messy storytelling baggage of retcons told over 144 issues.</p>

<p>The series has recently been adapted into an animated series on Prime Video. This series recently aired its third season.</p>

<p>As part of the closure of Monolith Productions, the Wonder Woman game that they were working on is also being cancelled. The game was expected to make use of their signature Nemesis System that premiered back in <em>Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor</em>. As of last known count, over 170 people worked at Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>This follows the stepping down of WB Games head <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros. Games Head David Haddad to Step Down After 12 Years">David Haddad last month</a> after 12 years on the job.

<p>The remaining studios that are part of WB Games are:</p>

<ul><li>Rocksteady (who worked on<em> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and previously made the <em>Arkham</em> games).</li>
	<li>WB Montreal (<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>),</li>
	<li>TT Games (Lego games),</li>
	<li>NetherRealm (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em>),</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, has just announced its first desktop PC, which is something it absolutely did not need to do — but I’m glad it did.</p><p>Partly because the world needs more tiny <em>4.5-liter </em>mini-ITX PCs, partly because it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s most powerful APU ever</a> (Strix Halo) with some actual gaming chops and up to 128GB of unified LPDDR5x memory… and partly because it looks like <em>this</em>.</p><p>Yes, you can create your own front panel out of 21 interchangeable (and freely 3D printable) tiles, pick your own two front I/O ports, and yes, that’s a standard-size mini-ITX motherboard below, along with a custom thermal system co-developed by Cooler Master and Noctua with standard 120mm fans, a semi-custom 400W Flex ATX power supply co-developed by FSP, a whole lot of seemingly perfect-length cables for a relatively cable-light system, your choice of black or translucent side panels… and, at left, an optional LAN party carry handle!</p><p>Just don’t look for any memory slots — it’s soldered. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn’t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus,” writes Framework.</p><p>Below, find a closer look at Framework’s desktop motherboard and cooling; you only get a PCIe x4 port, not PCIe x8 or x16, and no legacy connectors like SATA, but it’s more loaded than the image lets on: Framework says it’s got onboard 5Gbps Ethernet, two USB4, two DisplayPort, one HDMI, not one but two M.2 2280 NVMe SSD slots for up to 16TB of storage, and a Wi-Fi 7 module, plus what appear to be two full-size USB-A ports and a headphone jack (at the rear).</p><p>Here’s a little bit of the build process, as told by the images Framework sent us:</p><p>And here are some better images of the Framework Desktop mainboard’s I/O, in a rack-mounted, daisy-chained configuration that the company expects some AI enthusiasts might snap up — thanks to the local AI chops and 128GB of memory on the highest-end Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 Plus config.</p><p>“With Framework Desktop, you can run giant, capable models like Llama 3.3 70B Q6 at real-time conversational speed right on your desk,” the company claims, adding, “With USB4 and 5Gbit Ethernet networking, you can connect multiple systems or Mainboards to run even larger models like the full DeepSeek R1 671B.”</p><p>Framework CEO Nirav Patel says it was also designed with LANs in mind — though with a bit less bulk than the massive CRT moniotrs and desktops of old.</p><p>What kind of gaming chops might it really have? My colleague Antonio has seen in his time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">with the Asus Z13 gaming tablet</a> that Strix Halo is roughly around the performance of an Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile chip. AMD gaming architect boss Frank Azor was also here with some 1080p benchmarks at high settings; it apparently can’t quite play the most demanding games (like <em>Black Myth Wukong </em>and <em>Starfield</em>) at over 60fps at native resolution with everything turned up, but the claim is that even 1440p at 60fps is possible with AMD’s FSR upscaling.</p><p>Even if you’re not getting your money’s worth out of AI, though, the prices on these desktops don’t seem all that outlandish. While a desktop with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, 80MB of cache of the 395 Plus chip, and 128GB of memory will cost $1,999 — not including bring-your-own storage and OS — you can pick one with 8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores, 40MB of cache and 32GB of memory for $1,099. There’s also a 395 Plus with just 64GB of RAM for $1,599. Or, you can buy a mainboard alone for $799 if you provide your own mini-ITX case and power supply, too.</p><p>If you are looking for the most powerful mini-PC, Patel suggested the $1,999 model compares favorably to an Apple Mac Studio, which can cost over twice as much for the same 128GB of RAM.</p><div><p>Framework says these desktops and mainboard should be available to preorder today, with plans to ship in Q3. If you’re reading these words shortly after they were published, I’m currently at a Framework event in San Francisco, where the company also just introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/618769">new AMD-powered version of its Framework Laptop 13</a> and the new Framework Laptop 12: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618784/framework-laptop-12-touchscreen-convertible-announcement-release-date">its first budget laptop, its first touchscreen, and its first convertible. </a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ratings board lists Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S as platforms for the THPS collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No official confirmation has arrived just yet for this collection, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-as-fans-spot-easter-egg-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">though a countdown timer spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is teasing some Tony Hawk's Pro Skater news is coming</a>.

But when Vicarious Visions got absorbed, the publisher sought other developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth of it is that [Activision] were trying to find somebody to do 3 + 4 but they just didn’t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,” Tony Hawk said in a Twitch livestream in 2022. “Like, ‘What would you do with the THPS title?’ And they didn’t like anything they heard, and then that was it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question remains, then: if a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remake is happening, and it sure looks like it is, who's making it? The Singaporean ratings board only lists Activision as the publisher and developer.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stars-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-634584">Stars Reach</a>, a new sci-fi MMO seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsreach/stars-reach/description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a>, has blown past its initial funding goal of $200,000 in less than an hour of being live.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt the pedigree behind Stars Reach is part of the reason for that. The game is coming from studio Playable Worlds, led by Raph Koster, one of the lead creators of MMO classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ultima-online/" data-ref-id="5000-2222">Ultima Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-galaxies-the-complete-online-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-27644">Star Wars Galaxies</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRd5xiNfCg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZRd5xiNfCg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Stars Reach is putting a heavy emphasis on its sandbox nature, giving players the freedom to shape its galaxy how they see fit. That means it's up to players to terraform planets, build settlements, form trade empires, genetically engineer alien creatures, or wipe entire planets off the map. The game's universe is procedurally generated, and players will have the ability to shape it to their liking.</p><p dir="ltr">It all sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, albeit with far more players. There will be spaceships and action-based combat, but much like the more free-form Star Wars Galaxies from which Stars Reach is taking heavy inspiration, combat doesn't sound like the game's focus. There will be dozens of professions to choose from, some ideal for combat, but many that aren't. Its "endgame" sounds like it's whatever players want it to be, whether it be governing a city or exploring the deep reaches of space. It certainly sounds ambitious, with cities and even a planet's ecosystem all falling on the shoulders of players to manage.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike some Kickstarter games that seek funding on little more than concept art and a dream, Stars Reach is said to already be fairly far along, having been in development for several years at this point. There have been playable pre-alpha tests for months now, with the goal being for Stars Reach to launch in early access this summer. A full release is tentatively slated to come in the first half of next year. As stated on the Kickstarter page, seeking public funding "isn't about starting the game--it's about finishing it, expanding it, and bringing this living galaxy to its full potential."</p><p dir="ltr">Those who want to play during early access will need to support the Kickstarter at the $30 tier or purchase an early access supporter pack when those become available. The full game, however, will be free-to-play with optional microtransactions. Like many free-to-play MMOs, there will be an optional monthly subscription as well, though this one will be required for those looking to build homes on the intergalactic frontier. It's called the Property Pass, and along with letting players become landowners, it will also grant access to unique cosmetics and other items.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first Kickstarter update after surpassing its initial goal, Playable Worlds said it was humbled and grateful for the support.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is your victory as much as ours, and we can't wait to take this journey together," Playable Worlds' statement reads. "But the journey isn't over. The more we raise the faster we can bring this game to market. And the better the game will be."</p>
