That’s according to modder ThatBomberBoi (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>), who recently shared a glimpse of what appears to be the default graphics settings for No Man’s Sky on the upcoming hardware.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to take away from a comparison with the existing graphics defaults for the game on PS5. The clearest changes based on the datamine are that dynamic resolution scaling will go from 0.6 to 0.8 and graphical detail will go from high to ultra. It’s impossible to know from any of this just how much better a game like <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, originally released on PS4, will look on a PS5 Pro, but it certainly doesn’t seem like the new hardware will be a major jump. </p><p>That was already the take away <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329">from the reported specs</a></span>, which point to a slightly better CPU and a much beefier GPU. An early analysis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span> speculated that for simulation-heavy games like <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a PS5 Pro would certainly improve performance but not get close to managing 60fps in 4K. In that regard, the new hardware keeps sounding more and more like a PS4 Pro, which offered enhancements but didn’t feel like a must-have upgrade. </p><p>But the other big question around the PS5 Pro is when it will actually launch. With the base model reaching its 4-year anniversary this fall, the timing is perfect for a refresh, maybe to be revealed at or around a potential September showcase. That’s basically what Sony did with the PS5 Slim last year, announcing it just a month before it went on sale. <em>The No Man’s Sky </em>datamine suggests developers are already preparing for its arrival.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the help of several magics. Several more than I even thought you could reasonably stack up in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>if I’m being entirely honest. As a Soulslike player who often employs the blade and nothing else, magic seems <em>wild </em>in these games. I still won’t use it, but good for you all on evidently cracking this game wide open.<br></p><p>I sincerely <em>do not </em>understand the amount of things that Ainrun uses prior to the fight and their various effects. I get the Physick, obviously, but he goes on to use several more consumables, including a stone that appears to frenzy him—a tactic that’s being used to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225">obliterate other bosses</a></span> with powerful techniques as well—which stirs his character from a sleep that they fall into due to something else Ainrun does prior to the video starting. He also uses Ash of War techniques, which are abilities often tied to specific weapons that use FP (<em>Elden Ring</em>’s mana), like a flag standard that buffs Ainrun and a literal act of seppuku.<br></p><p>By the end of the exhaustive list, Ainrun is rocking something like a dozen buffs at once. With all the various items and techniques rattled off, including a weapon change, he enters Radahn’s arena, uses one more Ash of War skill, and then launches a charged heavy attack as the boss rushes to close the distance between them. You can barely make it out due to Twitter’s video compression, but that single attack does 93,000 points of damage to Radahn, completely nuking his health bar.<br></p><p>It’s a move so potent, it triggers Radahn’s second-phase cutscene and also <em>skips </em>the entirety of the actual phase. As it ends, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-lore-disappointed-fans-ending-1851588208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-lore-disappointed-fans-ending-1851588208">Radahn (and Miquella, I guess</a></span>) fall limp, having barely gotten off a single attack. Radahn’s move <em>does </em>connect and manages to kill Ainrun, but with the boss defeated, only Ainrun will return and be able to claim victory.<br></p><p>As busted as Radahn’s fight at the end of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is—and for the record, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">it’s <em>really</em> broken and not in your favor</a></span>—it’s almost been worth it to see how players like Ainrun craft builds to meet the challenge. There are obviously much simpler ways to buff yourself, like using just a modicum of the skills Ainrun deployed here rather than the full gamut. You can top up on Scadutree blessings to meet Radahn’s immense strength via <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s independent leveling system, but it’s especially satisfying watching folks go off the deep end and develop wildly cracked builds instead. Hats off to FromSoftware for allowing players to break the game in their own favor, and to the community that has risen to the occasion and shown Radahn what’s what.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3011460/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the beta for Concord has a peak player count of just 2,388 players, which happened on Thursday, July 18. Since then, the numbers have continued to drop from an already disappointing level. July 19th saw a max of just 1,654 players; July 20th, 1447; and July 21st, 1,117 players.</p>



<p>Again, this was a completely free and open beta over a weekend for a game that PlayStation has been targeting as its big hero shooter. If the numbers were that low when anyone could play, it’s hard to imagine what they’ll be when the game fully launches at its $40 base price.</p>



<p>Immediately after the full reveal of the game back in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players seemed turned off by the game</a> for a number of reasons. One of the big reasons being the seemingly bait and switch of a CGI trailer that showed an adventure only to be shown 5v5 FPS gameplay. </p>



<p>Based on the Beta numbers, it seems like the  negative sentiment hasn’t change over the last month or so.</p>



<p>We don’t have the numbers publicly available for how the game has performed on PlayStation. Neither Sony nor developer Firewalk have responded to requests for comment on the state of the game based on the early Beta returns.</p>



<p>Concord is currently scheduled to release August 23 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>What do you think the low Concord Open Beta numbers on Steam mean for the future of the game?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flock-is-a-celebration-of-weird-little-guys.933663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flock-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a lot of friends who are birders, a hobby I get in that you wander around outside and look at animals, and a hobby I do not get in that it sounds a little bit like a combination of homework and an eye test. But I love when I <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1660639329532669952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask a pal</a> about some bird I saw and they come back with a ton of interesting facts that make me think more deeply about the world around me. <em>Flock</em>, a critter-identifying game that came out last week, hits some of those notes.</p><p>In <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/flock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Flock</em></a>, you play as a newcomer to an island that’s home to a range of creatures, which you’ve come to help catalogue. You travel the landscape on a giant bird, swooping among the wetlands, forests, and stone structures looking for signs of life. When you spot a creature, you study it for a bit, then open your creature guide and choose its family before using provided clues to narrow down exactly what sort of critter it is. It might be easy to tell it’s a bewl because it looks like a little sausage, but is it a belted bewl or a collared bewl? As more areas open up, more creatures get added to your guide.</p><p>As per the title, you can also gather a flock of creatures of your own, by finding their missing calls via whistles hidden throughout the world. Using these whistles, you can charm creatures into a pack that trails around behind you. You’ll occasionally need to do this to find other creatures in your guide, but as far as I can tell, mostly they just look cool. (<em>Flock</em> has a multiplayer component where I imagine these followings look very impressive, but I have only played single-player.)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Flock - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNi2ytZDJeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>All this might just sound like checkboxes, but I found filling out the creature guide charming and compelling. <em>Flock</em>’s developers are behind one of my favorite indie games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wilmots-warehouse-is-a-great-puzzle-game-1837879681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em></a>, which is also about categorizing things; unlike the taxonomy you create for yourself in that game, <em>Flock</em>’s categories are about making sense of a world that already exists. You discover a robust ecosystem and learn creatures’ habitats and behaviors, see their variation across regions or times of day. It helps that the creatures are all delightfully designed and have their own distinctive calls. I most enjoyed swooping through an area, following the clues in my guide to look for some specific creature while being able to identify all the sounds around me.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>Flock </em>is very chill; it’s pretty gentle if you get a family or creature wrong, and it strikes a good balance of sometimes being tricky without turning into some kind of hidden object game. There are challenges you can complete for side characters, as well as the ability to change your character’s appearance via wool you shear from sheep you find and graze, but mostly I just enjoyed looking for weird little guys, being surprised when something I thought was a rock blinked back at me, or following some kind of floating whale on its journey across the landscape. It’s a lovely game to kick back with at the end of the day, exploring its colorful landscape and learning about its world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gold-nes-cartridge-auction</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-rare-gold-nes-cartridge-up-for-10k-at-auction.933654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gold-nes-cartridge-auction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A super-rare Nintendo World Championships<em>&nbsp;</em>NES cartridge is about to be put up for auction at $10,000, and it's apparently the first of its kind to be publicly sold in ten years.</p>
<p>If you know your onions when it comes to rare games, you'll almost certainly have heard of&nbsp;Nintendo World Championships. The original event was held in 1990, and a special commemorative cartridge was made available to finalists as part of that event.</p>
<p>An extremely limited number of those cartridges - twenty-six, to be exact - were given out as prizes by Nintendo Power, and it's one of those gold cartridges that's going up for auction later today. The whole affair was a big part of the inspiration behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">this year's Switch game</a>&nbsp;<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-auction-rear-view.jpg?itok=4Y3y0mQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-auction-rear-view.jpg?itok=sGHZk-oi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not look like much, but this cartridge is expected to fetch $10,000 at auction.</figcaption></figure><p>The auction is being held over on auction site <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1990-nes-nintendo-gold-world-championships-missing-cartridge-usa-cartrwlodh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goldin</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/PatTheNESpunk/status/1814737375467348375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pat the NES Punk</a>), and the starting bid is $10,000, although given how rare these cartridges are, the final sale will almost certainly be for more than that.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about this particular cartridge is that it's missing its label; the Nintendo World Championships cartridges all had a triangular label with the event's logo on it, but that label is absent here.</p>
<p>Whether or not that affects the final sale amount remains to be seen. After all, the cartridge is still exceedingly rare; as Goldin itself points out, only thirteen of the original 26 gold cartridges remain in existence at last count, and Pat the NES Punk says this is the first time one of these cartridges has been on public sale in a decade.</p>

Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.</p>

<p>SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery.

			<p>Ubisoft hopes that Star Wars Outlaws will become a highly successful game with a huge player base. However, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-has-no-plans-to-delay-star-wars-outlaws/">10-minute gameplay video</a> released on IGN's YouTube channel suggests that may not be the case. Fans seemed outraged at the quality of the game, claiming it looked unfinished and had uneven FPS. However, Ubisoft is confident that it has funneled more money into Star Wars Outlaws marketing than for any of its other games.</p>
<p>This information comes from a recent financial update from Ubisoft, where the company's CEO revealed that the firm has been putting more money and effort than ever into the marketing of Star Wars Outlaws. With this, he said that he expects a strong launch for Star Wars Outlaws, based on "positive community sentiment," which is highly contradictory to the immense amount of negative feedback they received when they released the gameplay video for Star Wars Outlaws. It was so intensely negative that a financial advisor from the Bank of America even asked if they would consider delaying the game, which received a firm "no" as a response.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot also said, "It's among the most awaited games of the industry this year." The second half of 2024 is set to see massive releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and the Silent Hill 2 remake, to name a few. Plenty of other huge contenders are out there for the most anticipated game of the year, so it'll be interesting to see how it shapes up for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft</a>, more footage will be released later to showcase more of the gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws. The dev team is confident that this gameplay will generate a huge amount of hype for the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is confident that the next few months of this year will be revolutionary for them as a business. Fans have the long-awaited release of Assassin's Creed: Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws to look forward to. In addition to these stand-alone games, Ubisoft has put a huge amount of effort into its live-service games, such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six Siege, both of which have gone on to surpass expectations this year alone.</p>

It’s a no brainer. </p><p>Dodge Attack is the Steel tree’s first skill and as you’ll be doing a lot of dodging in Flintlock, it will immediately come in handy.

This passive ability gives you a 10-percent damage boost and improves your swing speed every time you press the attack button at the exact moment your last attack hits the enemy. </p><p>It can be tricky to time this just right in the heat of battle, but once you get the rhythm down, you’d be surprised at how quickly 10-percent extra damage per swing adds up—especially against bosses.</p><h2 id="h428776"><a id="rend"></a>Rend Spirit</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree: </strong>Magic</p><p>The first skill in the Magic tree is called Rend Spirit.

Partially, yes. It gives us reveals that could have been delivered episodes earlier, action that would have been cooler a generation ago, and (SPOILER) the death of perhaps the greatest Jedi character the franchise has seen, all to remind us that the <em>Star Wars</em> universe is only as good as the filmmaking behind it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194617,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode 8,&nbsp;“Doom,” begins where we left off, with Osha (Amandla Stenberg) donning Qimir’s (Manny Jacinto) sensory deprivation helmet. Since the helmet leaves her alone with the Force, she experiences an uninterrupted connection to her own power similar to her mother’s—the ability to put others into a trance as she freezes Qimir in his own mindscape. That’s a pretty cool development, but due to the pacing of the series, we don’t get a payoff to this ability. Therein lies the biggest flaw of the show: it’s underwritten, without enough meaningful content to justify its own pace. From episode 1 on, <em>The Acolyte</em>’s directorial style all too often misses opportunities to give deeper meaning and emotional context to moments. </p><p>By this eighth episode, we’ve grown to expect long, drawn-out reveals, such as when Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) is about to tell Mae what she and Osha truly are as a byproduct of a Vergence, only to be shocked by Mae before finishing his sentence. Cookie-cutter writing like this held the series back from exploring more meaningful ideas in the allotted time for the episodes. The show would’ve benefited from a faster pace and more exploration of the little things that make life “in a galaxy far, far away” interesting. </p><p>For instance, according to Sol, Osha and Mae are not twins or sisters, but rather are the same person, conjured and split in two by their mother using the Vergence in the Force on their home world of Brendok. That’s cool, but the story doesn’t convey why we should care about this, other than it being rare.<br></p><p>Considering him a liar that murdered her mother, Mae tried to lose Sol in a space chase that is surely one of the best in <em>Star Wars</em> history. Flying through a Saturn-like planetary ring is simply good sci-fi. I’ve never seen it done before with such attention to detail. This scene is another instance where <em>The Acolyte</em> delivers something fresh that expands our collective minds, thereby pushing the boundaries of science fiction as a genre. Applause for this scene.</p><p>We’re introduced to Senator Rayencourt (David Harewood) in a meeting with Master Vernestra (Rebecca Henderson). The Senator brings a challenging perspective to the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, believing Jedi to be hypocrites of the self-control they preach, predicting that one day one of them will lose control and cause big problems for the galaxy. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of being a prequel, but his motives feel overly convenient, designed to fit the needs of the story rather than character-driven. However, Harewood’s portrayal of the character is strong, and a good counter-balance to Henderson’s stressful-yoga-teacher Jedi. In their first shared scene, the senator delivers the powerful line, “When you’re looking up at heroes, you don’t have to face what’s right in front of you.” I find this remark to be very timely, aligned with how we as a culture are increasingly questioning who and what we model ourselves after.</p><figure id="" data-id="2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-recommend-id="image://2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-format="jpg" data-width="810" data-height="457" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-recommend-id="image://2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-format="jpg" data-width="810" data-height="457" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We get more great acting when Sol enters the ruins of the burnt temple on Brendok. Sol walks up to where he’d had to make a decision to save Osha or Mae as they fell from a bridge 16 years earlier. Deeply unsettled by the memory, Sol steps back, almost as if his limbs are glued to the space and he’s pulling himself free with every step, contorting his body as he paces backwards. The body language here is outstanding, and for me solidified Lee Jung-jae’s portrayal of Sol as the most dynamic acting across all of <em>Star Wars</em> to date. I hope Lee is showered with accolades for his work in this series.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, that level of excellence doesn’t carry over to the finale’s big face-off. The fight choreography for the finale feels like the action design team had some creative limitations put on them, with very basic martial arts moves being shown in slow motion, as if they were special for a Jedi or Force-wielder. This is a stark difference from some of the amazing action moments in earlier episodes. The fight between Osha and Mae is incredibly plain, and feels more like a stunt person posting their reel on Instagram to build a following rather than the grand finale of a <em>Star Wars</em> show. The Qimir/Sol fight has a similar feel, like we’ve see it all before.</p><p>The battles end with Osha choosing to kill Sol. The show died there for me. The most interesting character and best actor in the series is no more. The tension of Sol confessing to the Jedi has vanished. Osha and Mae flee, and we are left with new questions as Master Vernestra arrives with a squad of Jedi. She learns the truth from psychic impressions in the space, chooses to cover it up in front of the Senator and council meeting, and now we see that the Jedi are flawed too. Oh, and Vernestra formerly trained Qimir. And Vernestra reports to Yoda. And I’m not sure if watching anymore is worth it.</p><p>I love art. Art can be interpreted in infinite ways, and everyone can find something if they simply take a moment to appreciate it. Then there are time-waisters,&nbsp;shows and other media that simply exist to keep printing money with mindless viewership. <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 8 has elements of both, and is perhaps the best example of the series being full of the same. Some episodes were truly powerful, some moments raised the bar for <em>Star Wars</em>. Overall, I’m left feeling that <em>Star Wars</em> wants to keep the same cyclical storytelling going, with masters training students that turn to the dark side, causing people to either run away from them or run toward them to stop them. This pattern was boring when <em>The Force Awakens</em> released, and it hasn’t gotten any better. With the last image of the series finally being Osha and Qimir holding hands wrapped around the same lightsaber, I’m hopeful for the sake of all the talent in the show that they get to make another season, and I’m reminded that <em>Star Wars</em> lacks a definitive artistic voice at this point guiding it to do anything truly bold and original.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The controversial truck is officially coming to <em>Fortnite </em>on July 22. To uh...celebrate this announcement, <em>Fortnite </em>released a short teaser featuring a digital Cybertruck. </p><p>I do think it’s funny that Tesla and the company’s owner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252">Elon Musk (famous for being rich, shitty, and weird)</a></span> would be okay with adding the Cybertruck to <em>Fortnite</em>, a game all about shooting cars. The Cybertruck is marketed as bulletproof, but that won’t be the case in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>. So Cybertrucks are going to be shot and destroyed quickly by players, which may not be the <em>best</em> way to market your bulletproof e-truck to people. </p><p>But then again, it’s not like the folks behind the Cybertruck have had many good ideas to begin with, so why start now? As for Epic and <em>Fortnite</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/after-swiping-lots-of-fortnite-dances-from-black-artist-1835285124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/after-swiping-lots-of-fortnite-dances-from-black-artist-1835285124">while it’s not</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-racist-offensive-ai-images-art-zonewars-epic-1851209249&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-racist-offensive-ai-images-art-zonewars-epic-1851209249">the <em>worst </em>thing</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-epic-games-art-battle-royale-illustration-1849860511&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-epic-games-art-battle-royale-illustration-1849860511">the game has ever done</a></span>, it’s certainly up there. At the very least it’s the most embarrassing and cringe-y move from Epic in some time.</p><p>On the other hand, I saw some players suggest they would download <em>Fortnite</em> just to shoot and destroy some Cybertrucks, so perhaps Epic is on to something. I mean, I’m excited to watch Spider-Man and Ariana Grande shoot rockets at a Cybertruck the next time I play. So maybe this was a good idea after all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a> today, publisher EA announced nearly a dozen of the anticipated voice cast for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>



<p>The cast includes a variety of veterans like Alex Jordan of Cyberpunk 2077, Bryony Corrigan of Baldur’s Gate 3, and more. The main character Rook will feature “four different voice overs to make this story truly your own.”</p>



<p>Notably, the blog also confirms that “Gareth David-Lloyd is returning as Solas, and Brian Bloom as Varric.” It adds that there will be other returning characters, though the devs did not confirm those just yet to avoid “story spoilers.” This implies there should be more surprising ties to existing storylines.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re incredibly excited to announce our cast for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard! </p><p>Rook: Alex Jordan, Bryony Corrigan, Erika Ishii, and Jeff Berg <br>Harding: Ali Hillis<br>Davrin: Ike Amadi<br>Bellara: Jee Young Han<br>Neve: Jessica Clark<br>Taash: Jin Maley<br>Emmrich: Nick Boraine <br>Manfred: Matthew… <a href="https://t.co/luaxR4GCtU">pic.twitter.com/luaxR4GCtU</a></p></div>— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1815403173944971266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement comes shortly ahead of Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s appearance at San Diego Comic Con, which will include a Voice Over panel. A few members of the cast from Dragon Age: The Veilguard will also offer a talent signing on July 25.</p>



<p>The devs teased that they will “talk soon” and “continue our summer filled with reveals.”</p>



<p>Last month, the developers revealed a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/watch-20-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twenty minutes of gameplay</a>, including both key mechanics and cinematics. BioWare reassured fans that the showcase only featured content from the “opening moments of the game” to avoid spoilers. </p>



<p>Most recently, fans asked about the potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nudity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nudity in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. BioWare did not provide a clear answer about genitals in the game, a mature RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Want your game to be showcased during Gamescom Opening Night Live (ONL)? Well, it’s going to cost you a pretty penny.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRaptor</a>, it can cost up to $288,000 (€265,000) to secure a spot on the main show. That is the max price and it comes with a 120-second spot on the broadcast. Want less time, it’s a little cheaper, but not much. A 90-second hit costs $234,000 (€215,000); 60 seconds, $179600 (€165,000); and 30 seconds will run you roughly $125,000 (€115,000). </p>



<p>If you don’t want to spend that much on the main show, you can get your game on the pre-show. However, it’s still quite pricey. For a 120-second hit on the preshow, it costs roughly $144,226 (€132,500). For 90 seconds, it’ll cost about $117,000 (€107,500); 60 seconds, $90,000 (€82,500); and for just 30 seconds, it’s still $62,500 (€57,500).</p>



<p>Despite the high cost, though, studios don’t seemed to be turned off as spots on the main show from Gamescom ONL have been sold out. You can, however, still <a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">book for the pre-show</a>.</p>



<p>And while it may come as a surprise to some, these prices are nothing new. For Summer Game Fest this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-trailer-price/">it reportedly cost $250,000 for just one minute</a>. If you wanted more time, like say 2.5 minutes, you were looking at spending over $500,000.</p>



<p>It’s not believed that <em>every </em>game has to pay. As some of the smaller indie games that get shown during these broadcasts likely don’t have the budget to afford such a massive price point. However, it’s still something to see the prices linked with a show like this.</p>



<p>Gamescom ONL 2024 airs on August 20 at 2pm ET, the day before Gamescom 2024 officially begins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"It has been an honor creating this game for our Kommunity," the developer <a href="https://x.com/mkonslaught/status/1814693409564549179" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said.</a></p><p>Mortal Kombat Onslaught was developed by NetherRealm Studios, the same developer behind the main series. No explanation was given for why Onslaught is shutting down. However, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-live-service-game-is-shutting-down-just-months-after-launch/1100-6520621/" data-ref-id="1100-6520621">not unprecedented for games to open and close in a relatively short period of time.</a></p><p>Recently, the CEO of Warframe developer Digital Extremes called on developers of live-service games to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-boss-bemoans-live-service-games-getting-axed-too-soon/1100-6525185/" data-ref-id="1100-6525185">try to stick it out and keep their games going instead of rushing to close them and move on. </a></p><p>Mortal Kombat 1, the twelfth entry in the main series, came out in September 2023. No new games have been announced, but the next movie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-supergirl-movie-release-dates-announced/1100-6523467/" data-ref-id="1100-6523467">Mortal Kombat 2, is set for release in October 2025.</a></p>

Those video game workers are protected under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) that has been adopted by major companies like EA, Activision, Epic Games, and Insomniac.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SAG-AFTRA is currently attempting to renegotiate the agreement to include strong AI protections, better safety precautions when on set, and higher wages that account for inflation. The union claims some employers aren't keen on a few of those provisions–especially those AI covering the use of AI–and now has the power to call an immediate strike if negotiations continue to stall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator">reads a press release</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "The parties are continuing negotiations at this time, but remain far apart on resolution of necessary terms covering critical A.I. protections for video game performers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crabtree-Ireland said SAG-AFTRA's resolve remains "unwavering" and "should not be tested" by employers. "Our membership voted more than 98 percent 'yes' to authorize a strike of this contract should the employers not come to the table with a deal that includes our critical provisions–especially in AI," said the chief negotiator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world’s most popular video games. Time is running out for the companies to make a deal."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been almost a year since SAG-AFTRA voice actors </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-voice-actors-approve-video-game-strike-authorization-vote">approved that strike authorization vote</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it appears that negotiations are still at an impasse. Commenting on the likelihood of strike action at the time, Crabtree-Ireland said members were "done being exploited" and wouldn't hesitate to down tools. "If these corporations aren’t willing to offer a fair deal, our next stop will be the picket lines," he added.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/22/the-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-added-to-fortnite-tomorrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.</p>



<p>For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.</p>

<p>The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg">aren't wielding a steel ball</a>.</p>

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="http://sobieska/">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>

The Tesla Cybertruck is set to make its official video game debut tomorrow, in Fortnite.

<p>
Many other games have featured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s wheels before - but only via unofficial mods. The Cybertruck has been added by fans into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-the-cybertrucks-been-modded-into-gta-5">Cyberpunk 2077, Rocket League, GoldenEye 007, and even Minecraft</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Now, it's set to be ownable in a video game for real - years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-new-truck-looks-like-a-low-poly-90s-game-and-the-memes-are-rolling-in">memes spread online suggesting the Cybertruck looked like a PlayStation 1-era vehicle</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, developer Epic Games shared a trailer featuring Fortnite mascot Fishstick riding in a Cybertruck and pulling what I can only presume is meant to be an attractive face, blowing a kiss towards the camera. You can watch it below.

<p>
The trailer is a nod to an official Tesla video of a Cybertruck in a tug-of-war with a Ford 4x4 (Tesla's original video shows the Cybertruck winning, though Ford said Tesla cheated and asked for a rematch). 
</p>
<p>
I imagine there will be people delighted that this silly-looking car is now available to buy, alongside so many other things, in Fortnite. But I also imagine some will baulk at the idea of handing over money, via Fortnite, to Elon Musk - who last week loudly backed the re-election of President Trump and pledged to donate $45m a month to his campaign. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté said he had to take "a step back" rather than immediately respond to Musk's online criticism</a> of the fact you play as real-life Black samurai Yasuke in upcoming game Shadows.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has reinstated former President Donald Trump's account, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-bans-trump-for-good-promises-further-policy-changes">permanent ban in 2021</a> following the storming of the US Capitol building.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear if this was specifically requested by the Trump campaign team. Eurogamer was provided the following statement from a Twitch spokesperson:
</p>
<p>
"We reinstated former President Trump's Twitch channel," it reads. "We believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president."

<p>
Further, Twitch has made it clear the same community guidelines apply to public figures.
</p>
<p>
"We continue to enforce our Community Guidelines and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules," the statement continues. "Twitch doesn't have a 'public figure policy', meaning all channels are equally subject to our guidelines, regardless of whether the channel belongs to a public figure."
</p>
<p>
Twitch banned Trump's account "due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence," it said at the time. "The President's statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public."
</p>
<p>
While news of the reinstatement broke over the weekend (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/twitch-unbans-donald-trump-we-believe-there-is-value-in-hearing-from-presidential-nominees-directly/">PC Gamer</a>) and Trump's account had not been updated, now it includes a live broadcast from Michigan and a 2024 campaign banner image.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US">Twitch's community guidelines</a> have clear rules on hateful conduct: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."

</p>
<p>
It also includes rules on breaking the law and off-service conduct - it's the latter that came into play for Trump's previous ban. "Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions," said Twitch in 2021 following Trump's ban.
</p>
<p>
Since the news broke of Trump's account being reinstated, contributions to Team Kennedy by Twitch CEO Dan Clancy have been discovered. Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti-vaccine activist who was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56021904">banned from Instagram in 2021 for spreading misinformation</a>.

</p>
<p>
Clancy has responded, stating it was his wife who made the donation. "Not quite sure why it comes across in my name," he said. "Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy but don't take this donation as me being a fan either."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Lol. But somebody's figuring out what political donations have come from my family  I did not know this till I read it here. </p><p>My wife must have made this donation. Not quite sure why it comes across in my name </p><p>Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy…</p></div>— Daniel Clancy (@djclancy999) <a href="https://twitter.com/djclancy999/status/1814525958885679484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

He then followed up: "By the way, if you're curious about my political views, feel free to ask on my next live stream. Happy to share!" His <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/djclancy/schedule">Twitch stream schedule</a> is currently blank.

</p>
<p>
Twitch has been marred by scandal in recent weeks, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm admitted</a> he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020 after exchanging "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".

			<p>Stardew Valley is an indie game that took the world by storm. Just one person, ConcernedApe, created it. While working on Haunted Chocolatier, he continues to release consistent updates for Stardew Valley across all platforms. The latest major update was uploaded for the game's PC version in March 2024, with players on other platforms still waiting to release 1.6.</p>
<p>As players eagerly await the news of when the 1.6 update for Stardew Valley will come to other platforms, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConcernedApe has released a small statement on X</a> to reassure fans that it is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>"The ports and the next PC update are still in progress. I know it's taking a long time; it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when I have any meaningful news." Most of the fan base supported this and appreciated his efforts.</p>
<p>Some players in the thread had a few additional questions they wanted answered from ConcernedApe. A discussion regarding free DLC and updates was initiated when someone tweeted in response to his statement asking about pricing. In the replies, the developer said they will "never charge money for an update or a DLC as long as I live." They also joke that they could "screencap this and shame me if I ever violate this oath."</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has been a massive addition to the cozy game genre, with many people loving the game and finding it easy to sink hundreds of hours into it. While it may look like a simple farming game, there are plenty of quests, mini-games, and stories to hear and unlock as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>This farming game is so popular that it received an orchestral performance that traveled worldwide for fans to experience live in concert. The developer has spoken out at events regarding how well Stardew Valley has done over the years.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has officially sold over 30 million copies as of February 2024 and hit a milestone with a brand-new all-time player count with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-stardew-valley-update-1-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of the 1.6 update</a>.&nbsp;With the potential for more updates on the horizon, Stardew Valley could soar to new heights thanks to the creativity of ConcernedApe.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-manager-2024-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-manager-2024-review.933561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-manager-2024-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’ll admit that I generally prefer to have direct control in racing games, but the F1 Manager series has made me equally excited to work behind the scenes. Watching a risky overtake pay off from the pit wall can be similarly thrilling to burning that rubber yourself, and a focus on team development and overall strategy between races can be refreshing. While F1 Manager 2024 is your typical annual update in many respects, content to make incremental improvements over massive changes, several of those tweaks leave developer Frontier's latest management sim more compelling than ever.</p><p>This year's biggest addition is the new 'Create a Team' feature, which offers a pleasantly surprising range of customization options. For example, different engine manufacturers add necessary strategy, asking you to pick your priorities between aspects like durability or fuel efficiency. Liveries and team outfits can also be customized in detail, with a nice assortment of preset designs that are useful for the less artistically gifted like myself. But one of the most interesting decisions is how you can set your team's backstory, which determines your overall goals. You could choose to be the small team with solid expertise but low funding, or the hungry newcomers determined to win at all costs, or plenty more. These options realistically impact your overall chances, and if you'd rather start entirely on your own terms instead, you can thankfully ignore them, too. </p><p>I appreciate how granular F1 Manager 2024's difficulty is when creating your team without selecting an origin. Different initial budgets, car performance settings, and facility qualities let you choose between starting near the front or rising from backmarkers to eventual champions. Of course, you can't set every facility to five stars immediately, which still keeps things balanced. There's a hard limit for improvement points, too, so choosing between improved race performance, manufacturing speed for car parts, or even the HQ's helipad provides welcome depth.</p><p>In previous games, choosing a constructor was effectively a silent difficulty setting since a team’s performance in-game matched that of their real-life counterpart. That made choosing midfield contenders like Alpine more appealing when I sought a challenge. Securing wins is always exciting, but spending time upgrading your team to earn them yourself feels infinitely better than being gift-wrapped victory simply by picking Red Bull. I'm also pleased that F1 Manager 2024 retains 2023's post-launch <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/2023/news/f1r-manager-23-new-difficulty-options-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>difficulty settings</u></a> for race days and your opponents' car development, making more teams immediately viable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>F1 Manager has never felt too heavy on micromanagement, and that’s especially true with the slightly improved UI this year. </p></div><p>Selecting the 'Your Story' origin in Create A Team lets you customize the initial team quality, and there's no restrictions on which drivers and staff you pick. In a year where the driver line-up is almost identical to the previous season, adding an 11th team that can sign existing Formula 1 drivers (or even F2 and F3 rookies) shakes this dynamic up nicely. Rather than choose Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc immediately, I ultimately signed Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda, intent on securing their first podium finishes.</p><p>F1 Manager has never felt too heavy on micromanagement, and that’s especially true with the slightly improved UI this year. Once everything's set up, a new season with your custom team is otherwise similar to a standard campaign, which isn’t a bad thing. You still need to guide the team's overall focus, instructing engineers to create upgrades for this year's car along the way. However, because each year brings new regulations, you face a choice: Do you keep improving this year's car or invest in research for next season? Striking a balance remains rewarding when you succeed, and the cost cap ensures you can't just throw money around to solve every problem. And once a season is complete, the board measures your performance against its expectations, and the cycle repeats into the new year, so there’s always a drive to keep going.</p><p>Keeping staff spirits high remains essential, and F1 Manager 2024 uses a new 'Mentality System,' highlighting the team's overall mood instead of individual staff and drivers. It's a slight improvement over the previous confidence system, offering a more practical approach that immediately details the most pressing issues. Pit crews retain 23's monthly training regimes, and it’s still fun to balance improving pit times and avoiding fatigue by pushing them too hard. After all, a rested crew is less likely to make mistakes during critical pit stops.</p><p>I'm less impressed by the contracts system, and as team principal, you’ll have to interact with it a lot as you negotiate contract extensions with existing staff or sign new talent. It's a tedious process because asking the person you want to sign a contract immediately, as opposed to giving them a week or two to decide, negatively impacts negotiations. For example, trying to sign Tsunoda to Red Bull saw him reply after two weeks of waiting, only for him to counter offer saying he wanted an extra $7k on the existing $3.5 million salary offer. It remains a frustratingly drawn-out process, and Yuki wasn't the only person losing patience during renegotiations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's great to see F1 Manager 2024 use a more dynamic sponsorship system.</p></div><p>Extra cash was previously earned by choosing optional performance targets from sponsors before races, like reaching Q2 in qualifying. You couldn't set deals until your second season, so it's great to see F1 Manager 2024 use a more dynamic sponsorship system. Title sponsors award more tangible benefits, and your earnings now depend on your confidence. Weighing a hefty upfront payment with minimal payouts for race day results against the opposite offer can be a satisfying risk vs reward situation. Each main sponsor requests various "engagement activities" every six weeks, offering financial rewards but causing issues like reduced driver performance. It's a welcome change that better reflects the sport's heavily commercialized nature.</p><p>Race weekends follow the real-life format, usually splitting your time between three practice sessions, the qualifier, and finally the main race. Six weekends out of each year also include an enjoyably straightforward sprint race where you don't need to worry about considerations like long-term tyre strategies. While F1 Manager 23 followed the 2022 season's rules, F1 Manager 2024 now uses a less than thrilling sprint qualifying approach split into three sessions before those races. I can't fault Frontier for following the current real-life structure; the extra work is just a hassle for comparatively few points when measured against the main race.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>F1 Manager 2024 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I'm therefore glad that F1 Manager 2024 allows you to skip the actual races by letting the team automatically handle them, a feature that was previously only available for practice sessions and qualifiers. I can't always recommend doing that when you'll generally get the best performance via manual control, and rushing through the campaign would be missing the point, but at least having the option may be a blessing if you're on your sixth campaign and facing the opening race in Bahrain yet again.</p><p>Most of the time, of course, F1 Manager values confident strategies, and racing involves managing three critical areas from the pit wall: tyres, fuel, and the battery. Good tyre strategy can determine races, so it's pleasing when your decisions about which two dry tyre compounds to use before the final lap pay off. Tyre degradation feels similar to last year, and ordering drivers to speed up is another tricky choice to make since doing so affects the temperature and how quickly you burn through them. Electric boosts via ERS (Energy Recovery System) can close some critical gaps with opponents, though letting this completely drain comes with risks of its own as it makes you vulnerable to being overtaken.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Themechanical failure system immediately feels right at home.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Fuel consumption also needs monitoring, but one of this year's significant changes involves preventing your engine from overheating to preserve its long-term durability. You can only buy so many engines per year and extra unit costs are steep, even before incurring a subsequent grid penalty for using extra parts. Those penalties can feel harsh when you're already pushing for every point available, so getting through a season with minimal purchases feels like an accomplishment.</p><p>Overheating also ties into a compelling new mechanical failure system. TV broadcast-style replays will point out mechanical faults but rarely indicate what the actual problem is – that seemed slightly pointless beyond informing me of who's got issues, but I enjoyed this challenge overall. Just like the real thing, some faults need mitigating mid-race by requesting that your drivers follow specific tactics, such as avoiding high-risk kerbs and driving in clean air. I never really noticed this system’s absence until now, and it immediately feels right at home. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Henry Stockdale's Favorite Racing Games</h3><p>If you prefer going beyond the pit wall, there's plenty of great choices elsewhere.</p></div><p>Accidents also seem slightly more realistic, though not majorly. Incidents that would normally finish a driver's race in real life often wouldn't retire cars in previous entries – this issue hasn't entirely disappeared here, but it was less frequent during my latest campaigns. The visible damage to cars during collisions could also still benefit from looking more realistic, as heavy impacts rarely show more than some scattered debris.</p><p>Finally, if you're after something different, race replays return once more. They usually involve improving on your chosen team's real-life results compared to what happened in the actual race, which is fine, but the more specialized events keep this interesting with less realistic scenarios – things like having equal performance settings for each team. What's really fun are the events that challenge your strategic thinking even further, like figuring out how to guide Ferrari to victory in Italy despite a mechanical fault near the end.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522484/" data-ref-id="1100-6522484">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion is arguably the toughest From Software experience so far and it has a monster of a final boss, but it turns out that even they can be beaten with a single attack. All it takes is some preparation, buffs, and an appetite for potions, and you can slay a god. As Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ainrun" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainrun</a> demonstrates in the video below, all that prep work allowed him to deliver an attack so powerful that it bypassed the second phase of this fight entirely.</p><p><strong><em>Warning: Shadow of the Erdtree spoilers below.</em></strong></p><p>To pull this off, Ainrun downed potions like <a href="https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Flask_of_Wondrous_Physick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wondrous Physick</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodboil_Aromatic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodboil Aromatic</a> while activating buffs like <a href="https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Unique_Skill:_Rallying_Standard" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rallying Standard</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_of_War:_Seppuku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seppuku</a>. Finally, <a href="https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_of_War:_Royal_Knight%27s_Resolve" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Royal Knight's Resolve Ash of War</a> was used to charge up his next attack, allowing Ainrun to slay Promised Consort Radahn with a blow that dealt 93,000 points of damage.</p><p>"This was the maximum damage i could achieve on Radahn using all the new buffs available in the DLC and base game buffs," <a href="https://x.com/Ainrun_ttv/status/1815100114303930827" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ainrun explained</a> in a follow-up post. "I could cross the 100k [mark] on weaker bosses but I couldn't figure out how to get to 100k+ on Radahn. Maybe another time."</p><p>For those players who don't carry a small apothecary of potions with them at all times, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-elden-rings-most-infamous-player-vanquish-the-dlcs-final-boss-without-taking-a-hit/1100-6524874/" data-ref-id="1100-6524874">Radahn can technically still be beaten without taking a single hit</a>. As Elden Ring legend Let Me Solo Her--now going by the name Let Me Solo Him--has demonstrated, expert memorization, dodging, and swapping between multiple Antspur Rapiers can help you defeat the final boss.</p><p>Since its release, Shadow of the Erdtree has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-dlc-difficulty-discourse-is-getting-old-spot-on/1100-6524592/" data-ref-id="1100-6524592">reignited discussions about the game and its difficulty</a>, with some players scoffing to the max at the thought of using summons to assist in battle.</p><p>While there are players who abstain from making use of that perfectly valid gameplay mechanic, those who do for the sake of proving their "git gud" credentials are missing out on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haters-be-damned-elden-ring-summoning-leads-to-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-best-moment/1100-6524732/" data-ref-id="1100-6524732">Shadow of the Erdtree's best moment</a>, a memorable scene revolving around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-igon-talks-meeting-miyazaki-and-his-grueling-vo-sessions/1100-6524884/" data-ref-id="1100-6524884">summoning Igon</a> to help in the fight against the dread dragon Bayle.</p>
