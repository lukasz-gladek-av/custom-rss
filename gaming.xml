</article>
<p><strong>Here's a look at all of Timmy Turner's abilities in Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Elemental Wall </strong>– Summons a random elemental wall of Fire, Lightning, or Ice that deals damage and knocks enemies backward with a satisfying poof.</li><li><strong>Mushroom Rain</strong> – Opens a sparkly portal that drops enchanted mushrooms from the sky. Each one smacks enemies for damage and randomly applies poison, burn, or freeze them.</li><li><strong>Vacuum Ball </strong>– A vacuum that slowly siphons energy from enemies as it pulls them inward, dealing damage with each tick. Enemies below 20% HP are instantly absorbed into the swirling core, forming the Vacuum Ball. Once charged, it can be hurled at enemies, dealing attack damage.</li><li><strong>Piñata’s Revenge</strong> – A totally cursed piñata taunts nearby enemies into attacking it. While it’s up, your hits grant random buffs, and enemy hits cause random debuffs. After a few seconds… KABOOM. Candy and damage for everyone in range.</li><li><strong>A Really Dangerous Weapon</strong> – Drops a magical cannon that fires a barrage of magical cannonballs. Hits enemies with rapid-fire blasts of damage. Nobody's quite sure where Timmy got it. Definitely not approved by Da Rules.</li><li><strong>Scepter Beam</strong> – Unleashes a crackling elemental ray that cycles between Fire, Lightning, and Ice. Each second brings a new element and a fresh debuff. Zapping enemies restores mana.</li><li><strong>Spiky Ball</strong> – Summons a giant, glittery spiked ball that bounces three times before exploding. Or press skill button again to blow it up early. Each bounce deals damage. Each explosion? Spectacular. Just don’t ask who tested it.</li></ul><p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store sometime this Fall.</p><hr><p><em>What character do you want to see revealed for Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny?

            <p>
July and the sizzle of summer are finally upon us. And as ever, a new calendar month means a fresh batch of Xbox Game Pass titles, which this time include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-ii">Little Nightmares 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has so far announced a grand total of nine titles joining the various tiers of its subscription service this month, with the first of those arriving today, 1st July. You can see everything coming - plus when, on what platform, and to what Game Pass tier - below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares 2</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Tomb Raider</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Legend of Mana</strong> (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Trials of Mana</strong> (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Chicken Horse</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 3rd July</li>
<li><strong>The Ascent</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 8th July</li>
<li><strong>Minami Lane</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 9th July</li>
<li><strong>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 11th July</li>
<li><strong>High On Life</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 15th July</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's a decent line-up, then, although Activision's long-awaited Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake will undoubtedly be the headline act for many people. But adorably sinister horror sequel Little Nightmares 2 is well worth your time if you're in the mood for some macabre chills, and that double-whammy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Mana series should keep fantasy RPG fans occupied. Beyond that, there's a spot of tomb raiding, some wholesome street-management action in Miami Lane, visually striking cyberpunk action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As for departures, six games are leaving Xbox Game Pass on 15th July, so if you've been meaning to check out any of the following, you've only got a couple of weeks to do so:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flock</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Magical Delicacy</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Tchia</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Case of the Golden Idol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>
To keep playing the above titles after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to buy them - but subscribers do at least get a 20 percent discount. And for everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Eurogamer's handy Xbox Game Pass guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> Patch 8.0 arriving last week, adding <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/space-marine-2-endless-siege-mode-is-coming-in-junes-free-update/">the big new Siege Mode to the game</a>, Saber Interactive has now teased a little of what they have planned for the game’s anniversary. Update 10.0 will arrive in September, and it’s planned as “a large-scale update”, heralding the start of a second year of both free and paid DLC content.</p>
<p>But first some bad news. With the scope of what the 10.0 update will bring, Saber has decided that Update 9.0 will only bring balancing changes and no new content, so the new PvP mode that was planned for 9.0 has been postponed and rolled into 10.0 as well.</p>


<p>This new game mode (while they won’t go into specifics) will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new mode-specific map</li>
<li>Chaos vs. Chaos PvP</li>
<li>Playable controlled Helbrutes</li>
</ul>
<p>With how Chaos-centric this new mode is, new Chaos armours will be added to the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new melee weapon: the Power Axe. This will have new moves, execution animations and more.</p>


<p>And finally, a new class is being introduced for both PvE and PvP in the form of the Techmarine. More details on this class will come in the next community update post.</p>
<p>With the arrival of update 10.0, Space Marine 2 will be heading into its second year, and given the huge success of the game, Saber is committing to a second year of both free and DLC content – this means there will be a new yearly season pass for those who need more Space Marine customisation options. The core of the content will be freely available to all, though, and so we can expect to see more new&nbsp;PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and even more beyond that.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the development team behind&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>in a rare moment of transparency, and one of the studio's biggest successes on the original Switch was created by the same team.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>was created by the same team who worked on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, which, at <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, had sold over 29 million units. It's safe to say, then, that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is in safe hands, opposable gorilla thumbs and all.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of what we thought of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>back in 2017, it's one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" rel="nofollow">few games</a> to which we awarded a full 10 out of 10 score, with our very own Andrew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy" rel="nofollow">calling it</a> "one of the best&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games ever made". It's hard to disagree with him on that score, quite literally.</p>

<p>The game will see Donkey Kong setting out to recover the "Banandium Gems" from the evil VoidCo., which seeks to exploit them in order to reach the planet's core, which is said to grant wishes.</p>

<p>He'll have assistance from a younger version of Pauline, who can sing in order to assist DK in various ways. She's also part of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s two-player mode; she can throw out damaging explosions if a second player is controlling her.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to destroy much of&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>'s scenery, which you'll need to do in order to uncover secrets and defeat enemies, as well as to open up your options for exploration.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-2785804.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <p>If you like getting Warhammered and having a scrap as a space marine, then here's some good news. Following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-siege-mode-is-out-letting-you-fight-endless-waves-of-tyranids-and-the-other-less-good-enemy">siege mode</a> last week, developers Saber Interactive have confirmed that it'll be getting second year of free and paid updates.</p>
<p>Hey, it's something to help quench your bloodlust while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a> to become more than a glint in the eye of a dev working on a big gun to be wielded by a big lad in big armour.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber have confirmed this extra year of "both free and DLC content included in a new yearly season pass" in their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225">community update</a>, outlining that you can expect it to include "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and ...more".</p>
<p>Before that kicks off, the game'll be getting the "large-scale" 10.0 update in September, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of its release. That update'll include the a new PvP mode that was originally set to be added in the next patch, 9.0, which'll now solely be about balancing tweaks. The new mode'll be Chaos vs Chaos on a new map, and will let players take control of the Hellbrute.</p>
<p>As for gear, 10.0 is bringing new Chaos armours for you to rock while you take on that new mode, as well as a Power Axe you'll be able to slap baddies up with if you prefer to swap your guns for melee mashing. There'll also be a new class, the Techmarine, which Saber are keeping their cards close to their chest on for now, but we can safely assume will love a good wrench.</p>
<p>There'll be more info on the 10.0 update's contents coming in the studio's community updates over the next couple of months, because woe betide the dev team that spunks all of its update deet reveals at once.

The studio is “based in Tokyo,” implying Nintendo EPD Tokyo. But teams at Nintendo can be fluid, with veterans moving between projects and reshuffling groups of developers as things move through various points in production. </p><p>Who exactly is leading <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Like, what are their actual names? <em>Mario Odyssey</em> was produced by Koichi Hayashida, director on <em>Mario 3D Land </em>and <em>Mario Galaxy </em>2, and Yoshiaki Koizumi, whose Nintendo credits date back to the original<em> Super Smash Bros</em> (he also led <em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</em>), and it was the directorial debut of Kenta Motokura, who also came from<em> 3D Land</em> and <em>Galaxy 2</em>. Is the same squad leading on <em>Bananza</em>? <em>VGC</em> asked and Nintendo wouldn’t say. <br></p><p>There are two reasons why this caginess matters. The first is that games are made by people, not monolithic corporations, and it’s always worth reminding everyone of that whenever possible. Nintendo was content to lean into the star power of its homegrown talent for years, making it even odder now that it tries to keep those kinds details temporarily under wraps (they will eventually come out in the credits, after all).</p><p>The second is that if the <em>Mario Odyssey </em>team is making <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, than who is making the next 3D <em>Mario</em>? There are three obvious possibilities here. The first is that Nintendo EPD Tokyo is somehow splitting its time and working on both. Another option is that a different internal team has taken the reigns of Mario for his 3D debut on Switch 2. The last and least appealing possibility is that we’re effectively getting a launch window 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em>  <em>instead</em> of a launch window<em> </em>3D<em> Mario </em>game, with the true successor to <em>Odyssey</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially many years off</a></span>. <br></p><p>For now at least, some initial evidence and rumors point to the first option. “<em>DK Bananza</em> is being developed by a new team that was spun off from the <em>Odyssey</em> team,” YouTuber and game dev interviewer KiwiTalkz <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed last week</a></span>. “There are a lot of younger devs in the<em> Odyssey</em> team that grew up playing the <em>DKC</em> games and wanted to make one.” He added that to his knowledge, a new <em>3D Mario</em> is still “on the way.” </p><p>The younger spin-off team theory, reiterated by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em>’s Andy Robinson</a></span>, suggests the best of both worlds: a triumphant return for 3D Donkey Kong under growing talent and as others from <em>Mario Odyssey</em> continue working on the next <em>3D Mario</em>. But everything remains speculation until <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is finally out, or Nintendo stops acting like game credits are state secrets. One of those is happening no matter what on July 17. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "Strange Tales of Modern Science" mission, meanwhile, has players investigating a nearby "man of science" who claims he created artificial life near Braithwaite Manor. "Bring the strange experiment to life by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight," reads a line from the mission's description.</p><p>Then there is the "Strange Tales of The Bayou" mission that has players seeking "something unholy" in the swamps of Lagras. Finally, the "Strange Tales of the Wilderness" mission involves meeting up with a scientist who is conducting "strange research" on people in Tall Trees. "When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202" data-ratio="0.54190476190476" data-width="2100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202"></a><figcaption>Strange indeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png"></figure><p>These new missions pay out 3X gold, RDO$, and XP through August 4.</p><p>Red Dead Online did not become the kind of phenomenon that GTA Online did for GTA 5, with fans saying Rockstar did not support the online mode as much as they would have liked to see.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> is out and as you can imagine, people are having a good time making their way through the free-to-play RPG. However, they've been confronted with what may be the most peculiar Atlus villain of all time: The Subway Slammer.</p>
<p>The Subway Slammer is a major antagonist in P5X's initial chapter. He's basically just a guy who shoulder charges women on the subway. No one does anything about it, leaving him to continue tormenting innocent people.</p>
<p>This may all sound a little random, but it's very much based on reality. Men who intentionally ram into people (usually women) in a manner they can then claim is an accident are dubbed "Butsukari otoko", or bumping man". It's a real, weird, horrible thing!</p>

<figcaption>It's the Subway Slammer!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CU2-2hfX_8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The community reaction to the Subway Slammer is mixed. Some are genuinely underwhelmed by what is a relatively inconsequential villain compared to other antagonists in the series. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyxunc2m">Lillie on BlueSky</a>, in reaction to the Subway Slammer's dialogue, wrote: "this looks like something someone would edit onto the textbox just as a joke".</p>
<p>Others find the absurdity of the Subway Slammer hilarious it seems. <a href="https://x.com/EXILEDpepsii/status/1939423712501272627">Memes are flooding online spaces</a>, with folks placing the Subway Slammer well above other antagonists from other properties.</p>
<p>Now you might think that people making memes about a Subway Slammer are a little bit out of line right? Persona games have featured themes of real-world problems, and the Subway Slammer is no different! <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/crime/%27bumping-men%27-are-a-uniquely-japanese-class-of-criminals-that-are-hard-to-deal-with">According to Japan Today</a>, "the severity of the bump - or in some cases even a punch - can vary quite a bit as does the purpose, whether releasing some sort of aggression, as a form of molestation, or in an attempt to claim the victim damaged an item of theirs".</p>

</span></p><p>The problem is you can't necessarily blame people for finding the depiction in P5X ridiculous, in part due to how it is portrayed. Yes, the Subway Slammer does hurt people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyzjes2m">but he also states</a>: "the whole Subway is mine for the Slammin'", which let's just say doesn't have the degree of seriousness one would expect. These people aren't making light of real people doing real crimes, it's likely many of them didn't even know about 'bumping men' before they played P5X, but it's hard to take a guy called the Subway Slammer seriously.</p>
<p>This whole thing goes even deeper too. According to P5X writer Yusuke Nitta, the Subway Slammer is a creation of the game's previous writer, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/">kept anonymous in a now-deleted Tweet by Nitta</a>. Nitta stated the writer behind the Subway Slammer was like "the lord of the palace", and assured fans the story will get "more and more interesting from now on".</p>
<p>So the mastermind behind the Subway Slammer is out of a job, but his legacy shall remain forever seared into the hearts and minds of Persona fans. What he's doing these days remains a mystery, but if you ever find yourself catching a train, keep your head on a swivel. You never know if the Subway Slammer is lurking nearby…</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has released brand new mission content for Red Dead Online with this pack of content called Strange Tales of the West. Now, according to the trailer this is volume one of Strange Tales of the West. We get a small glimpse of what to expect in Red Dead Online’s new content and you can take a gander yourself right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pcg9NVGMxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer for Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West you will come up against zombies, alligators, a cult that worships a blood red sun, and robots that look a bit like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. Full details of each mission can be read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Tales of the Plague – There are stories of a malady spreading among the people of Armadillo, turning them into shambling undead. It’ll fall on you to retrieve several of these diseased corpses for scientific examination, if you can avoid infection and fend off attacks from a resurgent cell of nearby cultists.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of Modern Science – A nearby man of science claims he’s created artificial life that stalks the grounds of Braithwaite Manor, killing those curious or unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Bring the strange experiment to light by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Bayou – Something unholy lurks in the swamps of Lagras. Explore at your own risk, be wary of ambushes by Swamp Folk who call those wetlands home, and bring the swamp creature back for Theodore.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Wilderness – Investigate reports of a missing scientist last seen conducting strange research on a crew of murderers in Tall Trees. When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the Strange Tales of the West content in Red Dead Online you can visit any post office or your camp lockbox and picking up four telegrams from Theodore Levin. On completion of each mission you will get triple gold, RDO$, and experience points up until August 4th.</p>

<p>The release of this new content for Red Dead Online is a surprise as in 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/08/red-dead-online-support-cut-back-as-rockstar-focuses-on-gta6/">Red Dead Online support was cut back as Rockstar moved focus to GTA 6.&nbsp;</a>The sign that support is once again up and running for Red Dead Online would suggest there is a dedicated team working on Red Dead again, and it may even point to more Red Dead news in the future.</p>

<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1400d0d0b7f88/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> developer Monolith Soft has recently reported an impressive 19% profit increase for the financial year ending March 2025.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Game Biz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/xenoblade-dev-monolith-soft-sees-19-profit-increase/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the company recorded profits of 487 million yen during the last financial year, which is up from 409 million yen the year prior. During this period, of course, Monolith developed and released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch, meaning that every core Xenoblade title is now available on one system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82txmwko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10LJgMQyAc" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Monolith is also known for its extensive contributions to other Nintendo properties, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the increase, this isn't the best performance from Monolith Soft – far from it. According to the graph below, the company's highest performance came in 2021, during which it achieved nearly 1,200 million yen in profit.</p>
<figure><a title="Monolith Profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5decb45064c45/monolith-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Monolight Soft / Game Biz</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of healthy numbers, reports have also been circulating to suggest that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/01/nintendo-has-now-sold-over-5-million-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-worldwide/">Nintendo has now sold 5 million Switch 2 consoles</a> since its launch. These come via updated figures on Nintendo's official investor site, but this has since been removed. It isn't completely clear whether what the figure represents, but it's likely to be projected sales that Nintendo had mistakenly posted on its site.</p>

Both Dot Esports and The Escapist have recently been sold to "a private investor" according to press releases, though it's not apparent whether both have been sold to the same investor.</p><p>Gamurs announced the sale of Dot Esports on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 13</a>, writing that the site had been sold to "a private investor." Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani wrote that "This sale allows Dot to chart its next chapter under new ownership while enabling GAMURS to double down on our mission—serving the Gen Z audience with cutting-edge content, product innovation, and world-class brand experiences.” Gamurs bought Dot Esports in <a href="https://medium.com/@GAMURS/gamurs-acquires-dot-esports-c2fb17b2fbd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2016</a>. </p><p>The company likewise announced the sale of The Escapist on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-the-escapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 24</a>, also noting a "private investor," with Chikhani writing, “This transition gives the brand a fresh opportunity to evolve independently, while we concentrate our efforts on building the next generation of digital media experiences for Gen Z audiences.”</p><p>Gamurs bought The Escapist in <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-acquires-6-new-gaming--esports-publications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022</a>, alongside five other sites, from the Enthusiast Gaming network.

Following this, several of its sites began <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updating less frequently</a>, with site PC Invasion redirecting to Prima Games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Both companies deny the claims</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/828e1a69f9b85/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you found yourself trying to pick up a Switch 2 across the pond in recent months, then it will be old news to you that the console, and many first-party games prior to it, was not available <em>directly</em> through Amazon US. It felt like a baffling omission, but a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) might give some explanation of why this was the case — even if the two companies involved have denied it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg spoke to "a person familiar with the situation" to try to get to the bottom of why Amazon US missed out on hosting Nintendo sales of its own, and it reportedly all comes down to a sales dispute between the companies around how the online storefront handles its third-party sellers.</p>
<p>According to the report, Nintendo pulled Amazon US' official sales privileges after clocking that "unauthorised sales" were appearing on the site, undercutting Nintendo's prices. The anonymous source claimed that select sellers were bulk-buying Nintendo products in Southeast Asia, before flogging them at a reduced rate on Amazon US.</p>
<p>The storefront apparently offered to attach labels guaranteeing a product's authenticity, but Nintendo instead opted to pull all of its official sales from the site, leaving only those sold by third parties.</p>
<p>Now, as we said right from the jump, both Nintendo and Amazon US deny these claims. "There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers," a Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg. The Amazon spokesperson similarly stated that "the claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate," though there are no specifics about <em>how</em> they are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Last year, it appeared that Nintendo's so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/amazon-appears-to-be-directly-selling-first-party-switch-games-again-us">"freeze-out" of Amazon US was coming to an end</a>, as copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> began to crop up on the site with Amazon listed as the seller. But months on, very little seems to have changed. You can still find first-party Nintendo products a-plenty on regional Amazon stores like the UK, Canadian, and Japanese sites, but the lion's share of US listings still come from third-party sellers.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, you're still better off braving the likes of Best Buy, Target, GameStop and Walmart in the US if you want to ensure the Nintendo guarantee.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-ceos-pay-rises-yet-again-after-disappointing-year.1232811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay rose yet again this year, despite the fact that two of the studio's biggest releases were flops and despite overall median employee pay falling.</p>

<p>According to an EA proxy filing (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>), Wilson raked in $31 million last year, including "cash and stock awards", as Game File puts it. Wilson's pay this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">marks a major increase</a> over last year's, so clearly, EA thinks he's doing something right.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;EA Sports FC 25</i>, two of EA's tentpole releases last year, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">financial disappointments</a> for the company, although in fairness, March's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">pretty unqualified success</a>.</p>

In 2023, median employee pay was $149,000 per annum, but the year after, that figure had fallen to $117,000.</p>

<p>However, as Totilo says, EA's metrics for employee pay are somewhat obfuscated, which makes their reporting a little imprecise.</p>

<p>The figure refers to "the same median employee" as the company used in previous years to report the aforementioned figure, which is slightly confusing phrasing, and the total also includes bonuses and stock grants, as Wilson's does.</p>

<p>Still, it's a little galling that in an industry where employees' jobs seem <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">constantly on the line</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">nowhere</a> does that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">appear more true</a> than at EA), Wilson can still be making money hand over fist in this way.</p>

<p>News of Wilson's payrise also comes just a few weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">the cancellation</a> of EA's&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game, as well as the shutdown of the studio making said game. One rather wonders if some of the money allocated to Wilson's bonus couldn't have gone towards saving that project and the jobs associated with it, but I guess I'm not a corporate exec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a presentation right before my roughly two hours worth of hands-on time with Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo confirmed what many people suspected since first laying eyes on the upcoming 3D platformer: That it was in fact being developed by the same team that worked on Super Mario Odyssey. And that tracks, because my main takeaway <em>after </em>playing Bananza was that this is the Odyssey formula to a T. The giant open fields with tons of hidden Moon… I mean Bananas to collect, NPCs offering clues on where to find said bananas, the simple puzzles strewn all around that reward exploration and curiosity, the deep moveset with a ton of different mobility options… Odyssey’s fingerprints are all over Bananza.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the formula is largely the same, I never got the sense that Bananza was retreading old ground. It turns out that swapping out a mustachioed plumber for a tumbling hairy gorilla is appropriately transformative. Even in just those two hours, I was absolutely enamored with Donkey Kong’s personality, his sheer sense of strength and power, juxtaposed with his surprisingly speedy movement, and the satisfying destructibility of everything around him. As far as first impressions go, this is everything a 3D Donkey Kong game should be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo had me jumping around to several different save files – the first covering the very beginning of the game with DK working in the mines of Ingot Isle. This served as a very basic tutorial covering the multiple ways DK could punch and smash both objects and the environment. It’s a unique but intuitive control scheme: the A button jumps, but then the rest of the face buttons are all punches in different directions. X punches up, Y punches straight ahead, and B punches straight down. This allows you to carve paths through the walls and create tunnels however you wish, with the only restriction being the material that you’re trying to break through. DK is pretty strong on his own, and can smash through dirt and crystal with ease, but sturdier rocks and stones will require him to grab a harder material out of the ground and use as an impromptu pickaxe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all as fun to perform with a controller as it is to look at. There’s a greatly satisfying and appropriate sense of power as DK is able to just plow through walls, send weaker enemies absolutely careening backwards with a single punch, and slam the ground with devastating impact, leaving craters in his wake. And he’s fast too! Between his already swift running speed, his roll, and his ability to surf on the objects he rips from the ground, DK’s moveset is the perfect blend of power and agility. It’s a super fun set of tools to play around with that feels like a mix of traditional Donkey Kong, plus The Incredible Hulk. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a super fun set of tools to play around with that feels like a mix of traditional Donkey Kong, plus The Incredible Hulk.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After finishing up the tutorial in the mines, the next save that I jumped to was set in the Lagoon Layer, which seemed to be the first real level of Bananza. Like Mario Odyssey, there’s a sort of main throughline in each level that takes you through a series of objectives that essentially tells the story of that layer. In the Lagoon Layer, its denizens were suffering from a water shortage thanks to some nasty invaders plugging up their water supply. So the main objective in this area was to essentially get the water flowing again in a very classic “raise the water level” style of platforming stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could simply mainline it by following the exclamation point markers that are easily visible with a simple press of the L button, but much of the joy in DK Bananza is venturing off the level’s beaten path (and literally beating your own path through it.) There’s just a ridiculous amount of stuff to discover even in just the very first level. Bananas are the main collectible, much like Moons in Odyssey, and are generally tied to some sort of minor puzzle or challenge. Like for example, there was one that was in plain sight, but underwater where DK can’t dive down to reach, so I had to instead jump up and crash down with a ground pound to nab it. Others are more complex and have you completing lengthy obstacle courses, and others still were locked behind special hidden platforming or combat-related challenges. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are multiple different types of fossils, which are used as a currency to purchase a variety of cosmetic upgrades, much like the different clothes and hats Mario could buy in Mario Odyssey. There are <em>so </em>many of these hidden all throughout the walls and caves that it honestly was a little bit overwhelming to even think about trying to collect them all, but needless to say, if you’re the type that enjoys collectibles and spending a ton of extra time in a level trying to 100% it, Donkey Kong Bananza will have you covered. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The levels themselves aren't quite as vast as Odyssey's but that's mainly because they're structured very differently. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The levels themselves aren’t quite as vast as Odyssey’s, but that’s mainly because they’re structured very differently. They’re layered on top of each other, with each individual sublayer feeling roughly like the size of a Super Mario Sunshine level. Once you reach the end of that sublayer’s so-called “main quest,” you’ll be able to drop down to the next sublayer, which is still essentially part of the same level. One particular challenge even had me going back up to a previous sublayer so that I could traverse a path that would let me get down to an otherwise inaccessible part of the sublayer I was currently on. As someone who has always preferred the smaller-scale levels of games like Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy, but also still really loved the exploration and sense of discovery in the Kingdoms of Odyssey, this felt like a really great compromise between the two styles of level design. You can also very easily fast-travel between checkpoints of each sublayer, just like you could in Odyssey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next two sections were from a fair bit deeper (again, literally) into the game. The first had me exploring a mining town with plenty of minecart rides and lots of opportunities to throw explosive rocks and make things go boom, while the final level was jungle-themed with familiar purple poison lakes all throughout. The big thing that I got to check out in these two final areas, though, were the Bananza transformations. By collecting gold, I could fill a meter in the bottom left of the screen and press R and L together to activate a limited-time Bananza transformation. The Kong Bananza transformation basically just feels like DK on Steroids. He’s bigger, faster, and stronger too, and can pound through walls and enemies that would normally be too tough for normal DK. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ostrich Bananza transformation, on the other hand, gives DK the ability to flutter through the air and cross gaps that he normally wouldn't be able to. It’s worth mentioning at this point also that there’s a skill tree, with the player getting a skill point for every five bananas they find. It’s not the most exciting skill tree in the world, with a majority of the skills seeming to just make DK’s already existing skills and stats slightly better, but there are a couple that add new abilities to his repertoire, like double jumping while holding a rock, or being able to drop eggs on enemies from above while in Ostrich form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got to check out Bananza’s two player mode, which amusingly has the second player controlling Pauline in a way very similar to how Mario Galaxy’s Co-Star mode worked. Much like in Galaxy’s coop mode, the second player is able to fire projectiles at enemies, only this time in the form of literal words that she belts out. You can change the power and properties of these words by hovering your cursor over a particular type of material and holding a button to absorb that material. And as you might have guessed, you can make use of the Switch 2 joycon’s unique mouse pointer feature to add some precision to your shots. It’s a mode that seems clearly intended for a parent to play with their young child, or to get someone who’s not into video games to participate, and in that way I think it succeeds, but it’s not a mode that I would ever engage with in any other sort of capacity. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty common for me to walk away from a preview event hungry for more, but after my two hours were up with Bananza, I was left with the mightiest of cravings. As someone whose favorite Nintendo mascot is Donkey Kong, this seems to be shaping up to be the 3D Donkey Kong game that I’ve been waiting decades for. For Mario fans still waiting for Nintendo to announce the next major 3D Mario game, Bananza looks set to be a worthy substitute in the meantime. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.
