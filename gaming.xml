            <p>Netflix considers Warner Bros.' game studios to be "relatively minor", as it admits they didn't factor into its $82.7bn acquisition deal.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros.</a>, which would include its game studios as part of the bid. That said, gaming was not mentioned in the press release for the news, while a webcast for the news only included gaming in passing.</p>
<p>Now, in the company's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters made it clear gaming was not a major consideration as part of its bid. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," he said.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Warner Bros. has been struggling in the games industry as of late. In its 2025 Q1 earnings report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">company reported a 48 percent decrease in games revenue due to no new releases</a>. Its most recent earnings report from November reports a 23 percent decrease, again due to no new releases.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; layoffs at Rocksteady after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopped</a>; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it's not as if Warner Bros. isn't capable of success. A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> had sold over 34m copies, making it one of the best-selling games ever. A sequel is reportedly in the works.</p><p>"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering," said Peters in the Netflix earnings call. "Quite well" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>He continued: "They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."</p>
<p>Though harsh, there's certainly some truth in Peters' comments. Hogwarts Legacy's success alone isn't enough to keep Warner Bros.' gaming studios afloat. And while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">change in leadership came in June as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, Game of Thrones), nothing has been seen yet.</p>
<p>Still, it appears gaming is not a priority for Netflix, which doesn't bode well for the future of these studios. So while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, it's unclear how this may be impacted by the acquisition.</p>
<p>And it's not quite over yet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-to-ruin-the-netflix-party-hollywood-studio-announces-clearly-superior-warner-bros-offer-of-its-own">Paramount has also made a public offer for Warner Bros.</a>, in a bid to outdo Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/10/activision-wont-do-back-to-back-modern-warfare-and-black-ops-anymore/</link>
            <guid>1378150</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3 (2023)</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> being two of the worst received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> games, Activision has stated that they will not to do back-to-back games in their Call of Duty sub-franchises going forward.</p>
<p>In a blog post addressing the future of the franchise, the Call of Duty team start by saying “thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months,” which is a nice way of putting it. “Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.”</p>


<p>Of course, for the next year, that means giving Black Ops 7 as much support as needed to tide them over to 2026’s COD. So next week they will be hosting a free trial for Black Ops 7 multiplayer and Zombies, hand-in-hand with a Double XP weekend.</p>
<p>“We would like you to experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves,” they say, and so they’re putting the two stronger sides of the game forward for consideration. It has been the story campaign that has come in for the strongest criticism, while multiplayer is a continuation of Black Ops 6, and remains the beating heart of this franchise.</p>
<p>Further to this, they promise “unprecedented” support through seasonal content: “Season 01 is the largest live season ever and we’re just getting started.&nbsp; We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made.”</p>

<p>But the most important point is that they will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, which has led to dismal reviews and a wave of negativity for the franchise. The team promise:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</em></li>
<li><em>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Black Ops 7 was another disappointment after the highs of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> last year. While Activision’s teams talked about how the two games were conceived around the same time, the campaign was a major disappointment, focussing entirely on co-op, replaying hits from Black Ops 2 in an unsatisfying way, and casting a pallor over the series just as shooter rivals like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a> arrived.</p>
<p>In our review, I said, “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series. It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a week, the second season of the Fallout show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will air on Amazon Prime Video</a>, and the main cast is currently busy with a series of interviews. Walton Goggins, the renowned actor behind what's arguably the most iconic character in the TV series, The Ghoul (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added to Fallout 76 as a quest-giving NPC</a>, voiced by Goggins), recently appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVH3ASR4cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Virgin Radio UK's 'Chris Evans Breakfast Show'</a> to reveal that creator Jonathan Nolan, the producers, the cast and the whole staff 'went for broke' instead of playing it safe with this second season.</p>



<p><em>I've been in this situation a few times where, if over the course of the first chapter of a show, if you will, if you're able to build a critical mass, what you have an opportunity to do in season two or chapter 2, is play it safe or go for broke and put everything in there. And that's what we did. We, meaning like, us in front of the camera, but really everybody behind the camera. There are 700 people employed by the Fallout show. It is a world.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, the actor showered Jonathan Nolan with praise for the scene in the first season's pilot when the bombs start dropping and his character, Cooper Howard, runs with his daughter for their lives.</p>



<p><em>It's based on one of the biggest video games in the world, right? Fallout. This game has been played for 20-some years by players all over the world, and there's a very unique attachment to this experience. When we set out to do this, Jonathan Nolan in cahoots with Todd Howard and Bethesda Games, the idea was to tell an original story within the canon of Fallout. So yeah, it picks up in the very first episode with the ending of the world really seen through my perspective. I didn't understand what a unique opportunity that was for me until I saw it on film. Even though I experienced it, you know, on the day, but seeing it, I didn't realize that it was going to affect me viscerally the way that it did. [...] The way that John Nolan architected those shots and the way that he chose to tell that story was terrifying.</em></p>



<p>The second season of the Fallout show will run for eight episodes, just like the first one. A new episode will be released each week, with the second one scheduled for Christmas Eve, the third for New Year's Eve, and the final one for February 4, 2026. The story picks up immediately in the aftermath of the previous season's finale, taking viewers on a journey through the Mojave wasteland to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without retconning the events seen in the game Fallout: New Vegas</a>). Deathclaws have been confirmed to appear this season, too.</p>



<p>New additions to the cast of the Fallout show include Macaulay Culkin, who plays a mysterious "crazy genius" character; Justin Theroux, who portrays Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas; Kumail Nanjiani, who stars as a high-ranking officer of the Brotherhood of Steel; and Amy Acker, who will play Cooper Howard's assistant during the flashbacks. The show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already confirmed for a third season, too</a>.</p>

			<p>Among the technical solutions Sony implemented in its PlayStation 5 to enable the system to reach maximum performance without issue is a liquid metal cooling solution, which helps keep temperatures down when the system is pushed to its limits.</p>



<p>This cooling solution, however, led to significant issues, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/">the liquid metal can leak and leave dry spots on critical components, resulting in various malfunctions.</a></strong> Although Sony made some changes for the PlayStation 5 Pro and some of the latest base console models, liquid metal cooling issues can still affect systems, potentially even all of them, according to a technician.</p>



<p>Over on X,<a href="https://x.com/Modyfikator89"><strong> modder and service technician modyfikatorcasper</strong></a> shared a new report on a PlayStation 5 Slim (CFI-2016) system with less than one and a half years of life, which has been impacted by liquid metal issues. In this case, however, the liquid metal leak wasn't caused by the system's position, but by application quality and degradation over time and temperature. As such, the service technician believes all PS5 systems will eventually require maintenance, regardless of the model and its position.</p>



<figure><div>

<p>While the claim that all PlayStation 5 models will eventually require maintenance is bold, it is undeniable that the liquid metal issues have affected a lot of systems. Earlier this year, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassels highlighted how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">these issues are becoming more widespread</a></strong>, with an increasing number of users reporting various malfunctions over the past few months.</p>



<p><span>As most <span>current reports of PlayStation 5 units malfunctioning due to liquid metal issues involve older systems, it will take some time to determine if the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-consoles-improved-liquid-metal-application-similar-to-ps5-pro-prevent-leak-better-cooling/" target="_blank"><strong>new liquid metal TIM layout</strong></a>&nbsp;of the newly released&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank"><strong>CFI-2100 model</strong></a>&nbsp;has been accompanied by improved</span> application to prevent degradation over time, as it should with leaking issues.</span></p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> now out in the wild and having earned a largely mixed reception, Activision have said right, that's it, time to do a thing. Said thing is committing to no longer releasing entries in the same sub-series, be that Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in back-to-back years going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This change was relayed via a the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">CoD blog post</a>, the first paragraph of which acts as a mea culpa of sorts for Blops 7 not hitting the heights previous entries have in terms of keeping shooty folks happy. Or, as Activision put it: "We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully." Ah yes, the capital F franchise, good job of not sounding like a robot there.</p>
<p>"To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward," the publishers added, in a line that sounds slightly more human.</p>
<p>So, no more releasing Black Ops 7s right after Black Ops 6es, or Modern Warfare 3 reboots right after Modern Warfare 2 reboots, in the name of providing "an absolutely unique experience each and every year". "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental," Activision added. "While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>For now, the publishers reaffirmed their commitment to keep on adding new seasonal stuff to Black Ops 7 and working to turn around opinion on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, declaring: "We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made." They're also keeping their chins up about the series' future, asserting that they "believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.</p>
<p>If you've yet to see how Blops 7 stacks up in the great pantheon of games about military people crouch walking and using sniper rifles to kill enemies at point blank range, Rick Lane kindly reviewed both its "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">hideous mess of a campaign</a>" and its slightly better, but also "overshadowed by the spectre of generative AI" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> for us.</p>

<p>It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion.</p><p>Despite her memory issues, Shadowheart is the next-chattiest companion, while returning favorite Minsc has the least dialogue of all the companions. The full <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spreadsheet</a> has some other interesting surprises, such as the entry for "Rat" having almost three hours of unique dialogue and ranking above major characters like The Emperor and Raphael--a solid reminder that we should definitely cast Speak With Animals more often.</p><p>The total tally of spoken dialogue comes to 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds--almost 10 days worth of voice lines spread across 2068 characters.</p><p>If tallying the length of all the files wasn't enough work, Everwhite-moonlight also created a seperate <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdseRVefYowbQfc5xE9VHvMsLbk6pU6F/view" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">document</a> that transcribes each individual voice line in the game, cross-referencing them with their cue ID for anyone who wants to find a specific line in the game files.</p><p>Despite its age, Baldur's Gate 3 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-studio-reacts-to-the-game-awards-nomination-what-the-fk/1100-6536343/" data-ref-id="1100-6536343">been nominated for The Game Awards 2025</a>, picking up a nod for Best Community Support.

            <p>Doom creator John Romero's cancelled game is back, with the developer stating the untitled project has "survived".</p>
<p>Following mass layoffs at Microsoft this summer, Romero Games - the studio set up by the Doom creator and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Soon after this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">Romero Games assured fans the studio had not been closed</a>, and the team was now on the hunt for a new publisher to handle its cancelled game. And, it seems a new publisher or some kind of deal was indeed found, with Romero recently stating the game had "survived cancellation".</p>

<p>Romero discussed the topic of his studio's cancelled game at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (see video below). Confirming it had been saved, Romero was met with waves of applause from the audience, before he shared a few more details about what we can all expect on its release.</p><p>"There's a really good 110 people working on the game," Romero said, adding it has "been basically completely redesigned". The studio's upcoming game has "nothing" to do with the previous game, he furthered, but "incorporates a lot of the elements" from it.</p>
<p>"We're not starting at ground zero," the developer said. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p>
<p>He added it is now a "much smaller game" than before, but it is "more fun" for the team as "the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn't actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that". Said Romero: "[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that's why small teams are great."</p>
<p>The developer still can't talk about the design specifics just yet, but said he has "never played a game like it" before. We do know that it is a shooter, though. "But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a very crazy place, and a different world, and it was really cool to explore it and be like 'what is that?'," Romero elaborated. "That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p>

<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romero-memoir-doom-guy-getting-not-one-but-two-screen-adaptations">Romero was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work</a>.</p>

<p>Puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a> launched on Switch last year, and we were particularly enamoured by it. Developer Wishfully quickly followed it up with the announcement of a sequel, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Children of the Leaf</a>', and the latest gameplay trailer promises it will be every bit as cute as we'd hope.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's Unity Awards Showcase, the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWoUwHXShgQ">Say hello to the Roller</a>' trailer introduces us to one of the many cute creatures you'll encounter on Lana and Mui's journey, one that possesses a particularly sticky set of skills.</p>
<p>Using Mui's transforming abilities, these cute fluff balls can stick to walls and ceilings, leave flammable trails, and roll along narrow corridors undetected. They are also really freaking cute, which is always a bonus — just try not to become too attached to them by the end of the trailer, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release date for Planet of Lana 2 just yet, though Wishfully and Thunderful have confirmed that it'll be coming our way at some point in <strong>early 2026</strong>. That leaves you a good bit of time to catch up on its predecessor, if you haven't already, which we described as "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan – perhaps even destined to join that short list of classics" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

            <p>Three new trademarks which very much look to be related to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series have been unearthed, with one closely mirroring the design of a desert monolith Geoff Keighley's posted a picture of in advance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">The Geoff Awards</a>. That <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595">monolith teaser</a>, which Keoff captioned "regal.inspiring.thickness" has been the subject of much chatter for the past week or so, as the big showcase hype machine churns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">MP1ST</a>, who have spotted these three logo trademarks on the website of the European Union's intellectual property office. All were applied for in relation to video games on December 9th, by German law firm Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte. Larian Studios' name isn't mentioned in the filings, but that'd be the same law firm <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98397930">they used</a> when applying for <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129">previous Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">first of the trademarks</a> is the swanky new Divinity logo I've used as the featured image for this article, while you can check out the <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">other</a> <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288404">two</a> - which seem at a glance like they could be alternative logos - below.</p>

<p>The one on the left appears to mirror the 'eye with weird sticky outy bits' design of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisit/comments/1pgd9j2/sculpture_found_in_joshua_tree_where_is_it_from/">Geoff's mysterious monolith</a>. I think you could also reasonably describe Larian's Divinity games as having a regal, inspiring thickness to them.</p>
<p>That said, the studio's ever Tweeterly verbose publishing director Michael Douse was quick to reply to a user speculating about fresh original sin with <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">the following words</a>: "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we've been working on, we will." Further down in the thread, he also helpfully confirmed that Larian aren't working on or talking about a toilet simulator as of right now.</p><p>Regardless of whether these do turn out to be the harbingers of a Divinity loo experience, the timing and context seem to point to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers offering more info during the Geoff Awards. If you're keen to get in a suitably divine mood while you wait to see if that's the case, here's former RPS deputy editor and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-baldurs-gate-3-lead-writer-adam-smith">current Larian writer Adam Smith</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/divinity-original-sin-2-review">review</a> of Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <p>As someone staring down the barrel of untangling a box of Christmas lights, I won't lie, a not tiny part of me wants to throw them in the bin and replace the whole lot with a fresh set from the shop. (I must stress, I won't be doing that. But the urge still stands.) However, Restory is a cosy game that appeals to the better angel of my nature, the part that will patiently untangle the lights so they can be enjoyed for another year.</p>
<p>Restory sets you up as the manager of a small Tokyo electronics maintenance shop at the turn of the millennium. Customers bring you broken devices to painstakingly disassemble, clean, and replace their broken parts, restoring them to working order. Though you can also order broken devices and spare parts online using your delightfully dated PC.</p>

<p>The money you earn from your work goes on rent and bills, and paying for the licenses to allow you repair more complicated and valuable tech. Though, from my time with the demo, the management side of Restory is on the lighter side – you aren't going to be adjusting the prices to undercut nearby businesses or seeking out unofficial parts to restore devices, for instance.</p>
<p>Due for release in 2026, if you head over to Steam you can take part in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812600/ReStory_Chill_Electronic_Repairs/">Restory's first playtest</a>. I've spent an hour with the demo so far and I'm enjoying its mix of management game and simulator, but there are aspects that aren't quite gelling for me yet.</p><p>Restory's repair jobs, at least as I've discovered in the demo, are fairly simple. You disassemble a device. Slide broken parts straight into the bin under your workbench. Order new parts from your computer terminal. Clean the dirt, dust, and rust from the pieces that remain. Fit everything back together and return it to the customer. In a game about restoration, the items in your hands feel both disposable and interchangeable, even as the stories speak to the items being unique.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the joys of other restoration cosy games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assemble-with-care">Assemble With Care</a>, comes from fiddling with the innards of machines. Rotating camera mirrors, spooling tapes, connecting wires in an effort to diagnose the problem with the machine you're repairing. It may only be a slight puzzle to solve, but that connection with the kit in your virtual hands makes the action meditative. You contemplate the object in front of you.</p>
<p>Assemble With Care may be an unfair comparison, as you only encounter each of its objects once, making them unique within the game. Whereas Restory is a longer game in which you encounter the same device repeatedly. While the (off-brand) recreations of 2000s tech, such as a 'Pokia' 3310 and an 'Autorolla' Razor, initially inspired feelings of nostalgia, by the fifth time I was unpacking a handset that looked identical to the others that preceded it, the devices lost their lustre. If even the colourshemes of the phones or the tamagotchi were to vary it might make each repair job more distinct.</p><p>However, there is still a tonal mismatch between treatment of objects in Restory and its stories. In one, for instance, a security guard arrives at your store requesting you fix his flashlight. The torch is rare, he says, and important to him. So I buy another one online, strip it for parts and repair his flashlight to return to him. While he leaves happy, cannibalising one item to fix another seems at odds with the messaging of the game.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While broadly the customer stories are enjoyably told – such as the recluse who lives above your store, who communicates with you via messages and items lowered to your window in a plastic bucket – they don't all work so well. In the listing details of an off-brand Tamogotchi on the in-game auction site, a seller writes "It was my son's. I don't understand these things… Please don't let it die. I can't get my son back, but at least his memory lives on." What could be a poignant story, instead feels cheapened for its throwaway nature compared to the time lavished on the guard who wants his flashlight fixed. Especially as you can immediately strip the toy to pieces to distribute among other broken toys.</p>
<p>What is already on Restory's workbench made for a distracting hour, but hopefully between now and release it can gain a little more variety. There is a version of running a small electronics shop – buying, restoring, and selling items to meet rent and pay bills – that could be thoroughly absorbing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pc-building-simulator">PC Building Simulator</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, and Trash Goblin show how diverting these kinds of granular manual work can be. It's just not yet clear if Restory will become one of them.</p>

                <p>It's been a busy week for industry speculation after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">Geoff Keighley started posting </a>about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/">moved into Los Angeles</a>. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-mysterious-monolith-is-not-for-lords-of-the-fallen-2/1100-6536750/">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">all shot down</a> by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.</p><p dir="ltr">A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="4304" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211"></a><figcaption>The logos trademarked bear a striking resemblance to the monolith's imagery.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A recent PlayStation Store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">database leak revealed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> is getting a Definitive Edition release on the PS5, but it's likely that the statue and the new trademark filings relate to a brand new title in the Divinity series.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is not far away now, airing on December 11 live from Los Angeles. Despite being over two years old now, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 is up for an award again, earning another nomination for Best Community Support.

            <p>New trademarks for the Divinity franchise have been spotted online ahead of The Game Awards, leading fans to believe the mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">Geoff's demonic statue in the Mojave Desert</a> has finally been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">mp1st</a>, trademarks for a Divinity logo and two icons have been <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">registered in Europe</a>. One icon, with its glowing orb and spindly leg design, certainly resembles the statue. Fans have therefore quickly jumped to the conclusion of Larian announcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 3 later this week.</p>
<p>Yet those hopes have been somewhat dashed by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse. "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity: Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will," he responded on social media.</p>

<figure>

<p>So what does this relate to? Douse's reply is in response to a leak of a PS5 Definitive Edition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, Larian's 2017 RPG it developed before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that released on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. "Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Douse.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So does that mean the trademarks relate to this new edition of Original Sin 2? Or is Larian working on a new game in the Divinity franchise, just not Original Sin 3?</p>
<p>The Divinity franchise began with Larian's 2002 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, and has received seven entries so far.</p>

<p>Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke previously announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">studio's next game won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor will it be related to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It will be "still familiar enough, but different," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-will-have-different-tone-style-way-of-doing-it-to-baldurs-gate-3-but-wont-dwarf-it">Vincke told Eurogamer</a>, while the "tone, style, way of doing it, are for us certainly new - and I think very appealing."</p><p>It's unclear what Larian is working on next, though it seems a return to Divinity shouldn't be ruled out. Either way, following the phenomenal success of Baldur's Gate 3, the studio's next game is hugely anticipated - and certainly worthy of a demonic statue.</p>

            <p>Activision's annual Call of Duty series will no longer see back-to-back entries in its Modern Warfare and Black Ops sub-franchises.</p>
<p>The change comes after this year's entry - Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, which succeeded 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">received negative feedback from critics and players</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">concerning sales reports across the industry</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog post shared last night, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">the Call of Duty team</a> - which includes studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> and Raven Software - acknowledged that the franchise had "not met" many players' expectations in recent times.</p>
<p>"With respect to Black Ops 7, we set our sights to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 and the studios have poured their passion into making a great game that all of us are very proud of. But it's one thing for us to say it, more importantly it's up to you to try it and judge for yourselves," it said.</p><p>As such, the Call of Duty team is going to be making some adjustments to its strategy from now. First off, it is opening up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-dark-ops-challenges">Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode</a> for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week. This is in order to allow anyone who has been on the fence about Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide" for themselves.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team is also committing to "unprecedented season support" for Black Ops 7, saying it "won't rest" until the game "earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we've ever made".</p>
<p>In addition, the studios said there will be no back-to-back releases of either Black Ops or Modern Warfare (which it did in 2022 and 2023) from now on.</p>
<p>"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year," the team wrote. "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p>
<p>It believes the franchise's future is "strong" and that its "best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent" of its development teams.</p>
<p>"We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the franchise and the genre forward," the blog closed. "We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together."</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 recently came under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was then brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to analyst Rhys Elliott and The Game Business' Chris Dring about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">why Call of Duty Black Ops 7 failed to hit the mark this year</a>.</p>

            <guid>1378087</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>

			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just surprised fans with the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch 2 platform</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, the game was already available to play on the Switch 2 for those who owned the Switch version, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated</a> in May 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-is-now-available-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in September 2022. However, this native version offers various technical enhancements.</p>



<p>The developer says that it takes 'full advantage' of the latest Nintendo console's hardware, including NVIDIA DLSS support:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing</li>



<li>Improved load times</li>



<li>Optimized performance</li>



<li>Joy-Con 2 mouse control support</li>



<li>Motion controls</li>



<li>Amiibo support</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the technical improvements, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is exactly the same as it was on the original Switch. Just like with that version, Nintendo users can enjoy three exclusive in-game items inspired by The Legend of Zelda franchise: the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Champion’s Tunic. New users can purchase the game for $59.99, while existing Switch users will be able to upgrade to the improved version for free.</p>

<p>Beyond that, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the same content as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it first released</a> on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on November 11, 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the original game's launch. </p>



<p>That means the official expansions released by Bethesda Game Studios (Hearthfire, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn), as well as the following Creation Club items:</p>

<li>Adventurer's Backpack</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Mail</li>

<li>Survival Mode - (included in Skyrim Special Edition)</li>



<li>The Cause</li>



<li>The Contest</li>



<li>The Gray Cowl Returns!</li>



<li>Tundra Homestead</li>



<li>Umbra</li>



<li>Vigil Enforcer Armor Set</li>



<li>Wild Horses</li>
</ul>



<p>That's the extent of the additional content you can get on the Nintendo Switch 2 (or the Nintendo Switch, for that matter) in Skyrim Anniversary Edition, since the game does not support the Creation Club menu on Nintendo's consoles, unlike PlayStation and Xbox consoles and, of course, PC. </p>



<p>By the way, if you've been hoping to see Skyrim's successor pop up any time soon, Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that The Elder Scrolls VI is still 'a long way off', and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will launch after GTA VI</a> in any case (meaning in 2027 at the earliest). </p>

<p>Use these Roblox Midnight Chasers monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and more.</p>



<p>Midnight Chasers is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-catch-a-monster-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that immerses players in an exhilarating street racing experience where speed and skill determine a player’s success. Unlike most Roblox games, in Midnight Chasers, gamers drive supercars, hypercars, bikes or regular cars — weaving through traffic, cutting across highways, or just cruising and showing off their ride. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate racing machine and test your driving prowess against friends or other players in high-speed competitions.</p>







<p>The more races you win, the better rewards you earn, which will help make your vehicle collection even more impressive. Because there’s a wide selection of vehicles, Midnight Chasers offers replay value. Thus, progression in Midnight Chasers revolves around collecting and using the game’s main currency: Cash. It’s the main resource within the game and allow players to purchase new vehicles and upgrades that can be used to enhance their racing capabilities. Thus, while these currencies can be earned during regular gameplay, redeeming codes will help give players a leg up.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-midnight-chasers-codes">How To Get More Midnight Chasers Codes</h2>



<p>Midnight Chasers codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes Midnight In-Dev’s X account, as the team drops codes during game milestones and updates. However, keeping tabs on the various sources can be time-consuming, especially when there is no notification system in place when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Midnight Chasers codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

<p>Is Larian's popular role-playing series back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8199459c2ebe6"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8199459c2ebe6/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're just days out from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a>, and one marketing stunt that's got <em>a lot</em> of attention in the lead up to the show is a mysterious statue located in the middle of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>It's ignited plenty of speculation online, and now a trio of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity</a> trademarks, which were filed in Europe on 9th December 2025, appear to confirm it's an announcement related to Larian's popular role-playing series. As you can see below, the symbols match the statue:</p>
<figure data-uuid="d33bce385024d"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33bce385024d/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: MP1st</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the news this week of a PlayStation 5 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</a> being added to Sony's servers. Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse responded to this, mentioning how the team <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">wasn't "meant to announce that yet"</a>. Douse has also supposedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/">ruled out Divinity Original Sin 3</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition were <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/new-divinity-logo-and-symbols-trademarked-matching-mystery-the-game-awards-2025-statue#google_vignette">rated by PEGI in November 2024</a>, but they haven't been released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmpug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/mystery-game-awards-reveal-is-a-new-divinity-rpg-as-riddle-is-finally-solved">our colleagues at Push Square</a> note, this could even be a "double-header" of announcements including "a re-release of Original Sin 2 on new-gen consoles and a fresh announcement for the franchise".</p>
<p>If we hear anything on the Nintendo front, we'll let you know. Larian previously released Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on the Switch eShop in 2019 (<a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/010027400cdc6000">and it's compatible with the Switch 2</a>), but we're sure many fans would embrace a next-generation upgrade.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-10-913/</link>
            <guid>1378036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another day, another dollar, right? Or in this case, another day, another round of much-needed NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is waiting for you, and I’m assuming that you’re keeping up that all-important streak as we head towards the most exciting day of the year.</p>



<p>If you’re pressed for solving today’s NYT Connections puzzle and need the best hints and solutions around, simply read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #913:</p>



<ul>
<li>WHY</li>



<li>YES</li>



<li>DEAR</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>YEAR</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>SUCKER</li>



<li>DUMMY</li>



<li>FAKE</li>



<li>GRACIOUS</li>



<li>YELLOW</li>



<li>CANDY</li>



<li>MERCY</li>



<li>LOLLY</li>



<li>DUPE</li>



<li>HEAVENS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Exclamations of politeness or astonishment</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Something not real or original</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Sweet treats and the people who fall for them</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Words that start with the same letter</em>, <em>kind of</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 10:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-10-913">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 10 (#913)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DEAR, GRACIOUS, HEAVENS, MERCY</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COPY, DUMMY, DUPE, FAKE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CANDY, LOLLY, SUCKER, SWEET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – WHY, YEAR, YELLOW, YES</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A has been released and it provides a welcome relief for those grinding for the Shiny Charm, removing a tiresome requirement.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm in Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A</a> is unlocked by maximizing the level of Mable’s Research Tasks, and, in the base game, obtaining it required completing one of the most tedious grinds in franchise history. However, that has now changed.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dimension-dlc-removes-tiresome-shiny-charm-requirement">Mega Dimension DLC Removes Tiresome Shiny Charm Requirement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Reduced grind. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To obtain the Shiny Charm in the base game of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, players had to complete almost all of Mable’s Research Tasks, and it was impossible to claim the reward without completing one task in particular.</p>



<p>Players had to grind through a whopping 1,000 victories in the game, which required repeatedly churning through the Z-A Royale to defeat trainers before the final reward was dished out.</p>



<p>The launch of the Mega Dimension DLC changes that, however, as additional Research Tasks are provided by Mable, making it possible to obtain the Shiny Charm without having to secure 1,000 victories.</p>



<p>Though the new tasks come too late for those who have already grinded through the requirements to obtain the charm, which significantly increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon, it’s a welcome boost for those yet to complete the grind.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to do, however, as the new Research Tasks require exploring Hyperspace Lumiose to catch new Pokémon, obtain new Mega Evolutions, and enter pockets of Hyperspace. However, they’re much easier to tick off than the 1,000 battles requirement.</p>

<p>From here on out, the team will "no longer do back-to-back releases" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3">Modern Warfare</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> games. The aim is to provide a truly "unique experience" in each entry and "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmpug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>- We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p>
<p>- We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update on the series' future follows <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">negative fan reception</a> to the latest outing <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which launched in November.</p>
<p>Although this change could potentially impact the development cycle going forward, the Call of Duty team believes the future of the series is still "very strong". It also notes how it's already working on the "next era of Call of Duty", which it promises will deliver "precisely" what fans want, and some surprises to move the franchise "and the genre" forward.</p>
<p>Microsoft entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">deal made legally binding in 2023</a>. This followed with Microsoft being given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/microsoft-given-all-clear-in-the-us-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> in the same year.</p>
<p>More recently, Call of Duty job listings have popped up online seeking talent with Nintendo Switch experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The team promises "an absolutely unique experience each and every year."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty will no longer release multiple Black Ops or Modern Warfare games back-to-back, after two Modern Warfare releases in 2022 and 2023, and two Black Ops releases in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and negative feedback and concerning sales reports for the most recent release, Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was delivered from "<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Call of Duty team"</a> (encompassing studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, and Raven Software) on the official website, in a post that acknowledged the criticism of Black Ops 7 as well as broader criticism of the franchise in recent years. As the post opens:</p><blockquote>First off, thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months. Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The post goes on to state a number of changes the Call of Duty studios will be making going forward. For starters, they're opening up Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week, in an effort to get those who have hesitated on Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves." They also are committing to "unprecedented season support," saying that they "won't rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the team had this to say about future Call of Duty releases:</p><blockquote>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</blockquote><blockquote>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The note concludes by saying the team believes Call of Duty's "best days are ahead of us" and that the next era of Call of Duty will "deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes come amidst, and likely in response to, a rough couple of years for the Call of Duty franchise. The most recent entry, Black Ops 7, debuted last month to middling reviews, including our own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">6/10 campaign review</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">6/10 Zombies review</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">significantly better 8/10 multiplayer review</a>. This is also in the context of both Black Ops 7 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Modern Warfare 3</a> receiving poor reviews in comparison to their immediate series predecessors the year before, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-multiplayer-review">Modern Warfare 2</a> being received generally favorably. This likely accounts, at least in part, for the decision to stop the back-to-back releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Black Ops 7, that lukewarm reception has also been reflected in the game's sales numbers, especially in relation to another recent major multiplayer shooter release, Battlefield 6. The game had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">"terrible" launch</a> in Europe, down 63% versus Battlefield 6 and down by more than 50% versus last year's Black Ops 6 in the equivalent periods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that we don't have full visibility into Black Ops 7's sales data, as it launched day one on Game Pass, and a number of people likely played the game through the subscription service and didn't count as unit sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But nonetheless, the announcement today feels like an admission that something has gone wrong here.
