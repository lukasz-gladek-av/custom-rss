<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> arrive on the Switch this October, and Nintendo has now released a new seven-minute overview trailer.</p>
<p>It features another look at the gameplay, the additional content you can expect, as well as the new features added to this updated package. The catch is, the trailer has only been released in Japan, but there's still enough on display to get an idea about what's going on. When an English version of the trailer is released (or a similar trailer is released), we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>You can see our recent coverage of this new package in our previous posts here on Nintendo Life. Nintendo has also announced its next Mario Movie is based on the Super Mario Galaxy universe.</p>

<p>Joining the 'Nintendo Classics' library next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be expanding its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with two more games for the Game Boy Advance library.</p>
<p>They include the Namco titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mr_driller_2">Mr. Driller 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a>, and they'll be arriving next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>. Here's an official description of both:</p>
<h3>KLONOA™ Empire of Dreams</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of a distant empire suffers from a serious case of sleepless nights. In his torment, Emperor Jillius passes a law forbidding his loyal subjects from ever dreaming again! One morning, our hero Klonoa and his friend Huepow find themselves in front of the emperor, charged with dreaming of<br>
adventure. As punishment for their crimes, they must defeat the four monsters that plague the lands.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Play as Klonoa and take down enemies with the ever-trusty Wind Bullet. Solve puzzles and collect helpful items like stars as you jump your way through 40 incredible stages! Help Klonoa in his journey to redeem himself and find out just why dreams have become so taboo...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mr. Driller™2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threatens the world's existence once more. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through multicolored blocks until you reach safety. Not all blocks will be breakable, so be careful that the blocks you break don't cause others to fall on you or cut off your Air Supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in three modes: Mission Driller, Endless Driller, and Time Attack Driller!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Japan will receive the same two titles next week. Will you be revisiting these games on Nintendo's subscription service? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>The arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of release, Dotemu and Tribute Games have slowly been revealing new playable characters. This week, a new trailer has dropped for Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider. An official description for both of these characters has also been shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"King T’Challa, the Black Panther and stalwart leader of Wakanda, dashes into battle wielding his vibranium-enhanced suit and sonic daggers. With peerless martial arts skills and strength, he’ll pounce on any threat or foe foolish enough to challenge him!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, Cosmic Ghost Rider can’t let that go unpunished. Atop his Hell cycle, this wild incarnation of the Rider roars across the spaceways. Beware: this Spirit of Stellar Vengeance punishes by wielding both hellfire and the Power Cosmic!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the previous character reveals include heroes like Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill, with the rest of the roster made up of Marvel classics like Captain America, some X-Men characters, and Spider-Man.</p>

Who knew there was so much treasure to be found there?! By comparison, only 487,585 items were looted from trashcans, which apparently means there's more to be gained from going into an outhouse than digging through a normal trash receptacle. Players also looted 1,811,970 items from boomboxes, beer coolers, and grills. However, red chests comfortably took the top slot with 14,814,296 items looted in the first weekend.</p><p>Getting all of that treasure didn't happen without a price; 2,034,399 players suffered an unfortunate end by barrel. Grenade fatalities were even higher with 4,563,416. Although deaths by toxic goo were much smaller with 349,734, those are the ones that looked like they hurt the most.</p><p>Among the game's vehicles, exactly 16,220,852 were destroyed, although the stat doesn't break it down by vehicle. Players attempted 62,718,658 boss battles, and 55,403,323 bosses fell in defeat. However, there were 16,220,852 failed boss encounters that left the players on the losing end.</p><p>Additionally, Gearbox shared a code for the Break Free Pack and two ECHO-4 drone skins: JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R.</p><p>Although Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">had primarily positive critical reviews</a>, PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">have been very vocal on Steam</a> about performance and optimization issues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3 is one of the best-selling and most acclaimed video games of all time, yet for all the countless play-hours that have been poured into its narratives and subsystems, there’s one in particular that stands out: Gwent. This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Gwent_Card_Game">mini-game </a>within the game which sees the player collecting cards from diverse sources, building a deck and seeking out opponents, sometimes for money, often just for fun. Players loved it, swapped tips on where to get the best cards, how to beat the hardest foes, spent entire sessions just playing Gwent instead of furthering the game’s main plot and innumerable side-quests. Perhaps inevitably, it has now arrived in a stand-alone, physical version.</p><div catalogid="82044c57-cd8b-4820-bee8-5264c6ed6bfd" id="228172"><div id="228172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gwent: The Legendary Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, there are actually two different versions of Gwent. There’s the one from The Witcher 3 game and a separate video game called <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>, which is run by the gaming platform GOG and differs considerably from the original, leveraging online matchup play to let players go head to head. This physical card game is a faithful replication of the original Witcher 3 version, not the GOG version. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as the protagonist, Geralt, collects cards to play Gwent in the video game, so Gwent: The Legendary Card Game, is a box full of cards. It’s important to note that it contains versions of all the cards from the video game, plus its downloadable content, which amounts to almost 450 cards in total. They’re also very similar to the ones you’ll see on-screen, using the same layout, artwork and iconography.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a little frustrating – some cards have explanatory text, which is very helpful, while others just have icons even though there’s room on them for a description – it does allow you to admire the art. Among the gorgeous polygons on the video game, it’s easy to overlook how good and how varied the card art for Gwent is. Here, it’s front and center, and it’s delightful, full of life and detail, and every card is different, even if they’re functionally identical copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the cards, there’s a tiny punchboard of tokens and a paper play mat to organize your cards during the game. These are both terribly disappointing, flimsy and prone to wear and tear. The play mat doesn’t lie flat easily, and the creases make the cards slide. Among the tokens is a score tracker and it’s often easier just to use that and organize the cards during play yourself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gwent is actually a pretty weird game, although you might not immediately pick that up from scanning the rulebook, which is overly terse and offers little in the way of examples. It’s played over three rounds and the first player to win two wins the whole match. At the start of the first round, you draw 10 cards and – this is the odd and critical bit – that’s all you get for the entire game. You don’t draw any more cards in rounds two or three. Your initial 10 has to last you the whole match, and learning when to dole them out and when to retain them is a central plank of the game’s strategy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gwent is actually a pretty weird game, although you might not immediately pick that up from scanning the rulebook.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your play area is divided into three rows, for melee, missile, and siege units. Most cards have a symbol indicating which row they’re played into. Playing a card is often as simple as placing it into its marked row. Such cards generally have a strength value, and you’ll add that value to your growing total of strength in play. This continues until one player passes instead of playing a card, whereupon their opponent can carry on playing cards until they, too, pass. Then, the player with the highest strength total wins the round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this sounds simple, it immediately throws down some challenges for the players. In the first round, either player can likely win if they just keep on playing cards, but doing so leaves them less likely to win the other two rounds and thus the game. So, you’re trying to read each other, considering the cards in your hand and deciding when to pass and when to push. There’s a Poker-like element to this, muddied by the fact that there’s no statistics to rely on in terms of predicting what your opponent is holding, which means there’s no real bluff element. In fact, if they’ve built the deck themselves, you might have no information at all. There’s a definite thrill of venturing into the unknown with each decision, but your choices to pass or play are being made in a frustrating vacuum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To combat this, the game offers various cards with special abilities, which are denoted by an icon on the card rather than text, a minor speedbump to overcome while learning the game. They’re mostly very simple. Tight Bond multiplies the strength of the card by the number of other cards on your side with the same name. Cards with the Spy ability are played into your opponent’s half of the field, adding their strength to their side, but allowing you to draw two new cards in return. A Medic lets you retrieve and play a card from your discard, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These muddy the waters somewhat. You won’t want to play a Medic on the opening turn, for a simple example, as there probably won’t be any discards available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to unit cards are various categories of special cards. The easiest to handle are heroes, which behave largely as units do but are immune to special abilities, making them harder to destroy or nullify. Weather cards are played to the side of the board and affect both sides, reducing the strength of all cards (except heroes) in one of the three areas to one. These can produce huge swings, as can some other special cards like Commander’s Horn, which doubles the strength of all cards on its row, or Scorch, which sends the highest-strength cards in the game to the discard pile. These add to the excitement and anticipation of the pass-or-play mechanic and also give some tactical structure to play around. If your opponent is laying down ranged combat cards and you’re holding a Fog weather card that’ll reduce that row to strength 1, you can save your own ranged cards for next round and hope to spring a nasty surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the full span of card types and powers do make your turn to turn decision making more interesting, and up the stakes considerably given that some of them can be game changing, you’re still very much making decisions in the dark. That Fog card, for instance: the strategy is pretty basic, and isn’t actually all that useful if your opponent only has one ranged card in hand and it’s useless if they also have a Clear Weather card to counter it. You have no way of knowing what’s in their hand or deck. Gwent is an exciting game, but it’s not a particularly strategic one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is, however, a deck construction game, and deck construction games mostly draw their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from deciding which cards you’re going to include in your deck before you play. There are various rules about what you can include. A legal deck includes a single leader, who offers a special ability you can use one time during play, at least 22 unit cards, and up to 10 special cards like heroes and weather. There are five factions included in the game, each of which has a particular play style and set of powers, and you can only build with cards from your own faction. Nilfgaard, for example, specializes in card draw while the Skellige deck includes berserkers that can be triggered and replaced with much more powerful alternatives. And since you have all the cards from the video game at your disposal, you have a lot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble is that, however you choose to construct your deck, the game is eternally held back by that sense of randomness. You can put all the work you want into your carefully-curated cards but if your opponent just happens to have a card that counters your best abilities, you’re probably screwed. Or not, if they just happen to play it at the wrong time because they’re as clueless about what you’re holding as you are about their hand. Worse, it seems fairly clear that some cards and factions are better than others. That 10-card limit over the entire game is so brutal that the two extra cards drawn by a spy can be absolutely game-changing. Thus, factions that are good at generating card draws – Northern Realms, Nilfgaard, and Monsters – are better than those that don’t. And within those factions, you’ll generally want to include abilities that draw cards over those that don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, there’s a considerable frustration around tracking the game state. You’re given counters to mark your strength total in tens and ones, which is fiddly to start with. But as soon as you get effects like commander’s horn and tight bond, strength totals can rise and fall explosively, and there’s no way to mark this other than recalculating your total strength with each and every card play. In the original video game this was all done automatically, making it easy, but here’s it’s a right royal pain, especially given the way card effects can pile on card effects, making it easy to miss something and calculate a wrong total.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5X0V5?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://store.ign.com/products/the-witcher-gwent-the-legendary-card-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get it at IGN Store</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/98Ppl2?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hachette Boardgames</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrwkq?object_uuid=64692f53-b742-449a-bb4f-8f058839a218&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at No Loading Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 17, 2025 10:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Inside the original whole of a video game, Gwent was great. Chasing down the cards you wanted was fun and addictive, it offered a pleasing change of pace from the main role-playing narrative, and the game was fast and smooth. As a stand-alone physical game, it’s rather less engaging, clumsy to administer and highlighting its lack of tactical and strategic depth. It’s not without its charms: it’s still fairly quick, and it builds tension nicely through play and counterplay, even if your ability to plan and react are severely limited by your card draw. Ironically, in a neat illustration of the power of collectible card games, releasing all the cards in a single set might actually have been the game’s undoing, robbing it of the pleasure of slowly upgrading and refining your ultimate deck.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gwent-the-legendary-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/2xko-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-review-in-progress-closed-beta-impressions.1300953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t think there’s ever been a fighting game that I have played more of so long before release than 2XKO. Between three Evo demos and two “alpha lab” tests, Riot’s exciting League of Legends-themed 2v2 tag fighter has repeatedly popped into my life for a couple days, then faded from existence until the next time I get to throw down with my buddies Ekko and Ahri. But finally, with the recent closed beta, 2XKO is here to stay (if not fully available to everybody yet), which means it's time for some extended thoughts on why I’ve been looking forward to this exciting tag fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a whole lot to unpack, so let’s start with the focus on simple controls. Unlike most fighting games that offer at least the option of using traditional command inputs for special moves (like those dating back to the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat’s arcade cabinet days), 2XKO simplifies all of its special and super moves to single or simultaneous two-button presses. So instead of doing a quarter circle forward motion for a fireball, all you have to do is press the S1 button; If you wanna do a super, you press an attack button and one of the special buttons at the same time; and if you want to do your ultimate attack, you press both special buttons at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a double-edged sword, because while it does make it a little easier for a complete newcomer who has trouble with quarter-circle or Dragon-Punch inputs, it also turns what should be a four-button game – with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, plus a tag button – into a six-button game, at minimum. Most people will be using a dash and parry macro as well, putting every single button on a standard controller to work. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, I’ve felt my hands getting lost on my controller in 2XKO moreso than any other fighting game I’ve played because my brain has to parse which special move is tied to which special button, and which direction I had to hold for it. Ultimately, it’s just easier for me – someone who has committed thousands of hours to train my muscle memory on how fighting games have always worked – to compartmentalize a punch or kick related special move input to the punch or kick button than it is to try and remember whether they’re arbitrarily placed on S1 or S2. It’s a learning curve that I was eventually able to overcome, but one that nonetheless made me yearn for a classic/modern control scheme split like what Street Fighter 6 uses. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second big thing is that 2XKO uses an active tag system much like what’s been used in games like BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle and Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid. The idea is that every character has two assist moves that they can be called in to execute, and once they finish the attack they’ll remain in a pose for a few seconds before retreating back off screen. At any point while the assist character is on screen, you can press the tag button to swap control to them. This opens the door for potential tricky mix-up opportunities, especially when you’re able to sandwich your target between your assist and point characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That system works incredibly well here in 2XKO, especially since so many of the characters have special moves that seemed designed specifically around it. Vi and Ekko for instance, both have specials that allow them to cross to the other side of their opponent, with the downside being that they are typically punishable. But if you cover them with an assist, not only do you make the crossover safe, but you get a free left/right mix-up opportunity by swapping to the other character. This is just a basic example and, once you start digging deep into the tech of some of these characters, you can find some absolutely dirty stuff that you can do to your opponent. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Experimenting with each fuse to find which fits my playstyle has been a lot of fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And all of that is before even bringing fuses into the mix. Much like Grooves in the Capcom vs SNK series, Fuses are an extra little bonus that you take with you into a match that allow you to break one of the established rules. For example, typically, once you use your super, your combo is over. But with Double Down you can do a super, then tag in your partner character for them to do <em>their</em> super to add on extra damage, and switch characters in the deal. You normally are only allowed one active tag per assist call, but with the Freestyle fuse you can call in your assist, active tag to them, do a couple of hits, and then active tag again back to the point character. These Fuses can totally change your approach to how you use your team and spend your meter, and experimenting with each to try and find which one fits my playstyle and my team best has been a lot of fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t want to learn two characters and instead just want to focus on one, there are also two Fuses that allow you to do just that. Juggernaut and Sidekick both have you playing as only one character with just one life bar, but to make up for that they have increased health, higher defense, start with two bars of super instead of one, and can have a maximum of five bars of super instead of three.</p><div id="2xko-character-community-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">2XKO Character Community Tier List</h3><h3>2XKO Character Community Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Juggernaut also has the added advantage of being able to forcibly swap an opponent’s character to focus on the one with less health and prevent them from regaining gray life, while Sidekick gives you the ability to reduce the amount of damage you take by timing button presses with enemy attacks. You can also charge up your assist moves by holdingthe tag button, letting them travel a distance before actually committing to their attack. You do lose the ability to do active tags, which is one of the most fun aspects of 2XKO, but nonetheless, I love it when tag fighters find ways to let us just focus on mastering a single character instead of having to be equally good with two or three. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best unique feature of 2XKO, though, is the fact that it’s a fighting game that can be played cooperatively with a friend. In Duos mode, each person controls their own character, with the off-screen player being the one that can call the assist, and the other being the one that has to do the active tag to give up control to their partner. It works both as a fun way to experience a fighting game with a similarly skilled friend that doesn’t involve having to beat each other up, and also as a way to introduce someone new to the genre and be able to give them real time feedback. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If there's one glaring weakness of 2XKO's beta right now, it's the slim roster size.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one glaring weakness of 2XKO right now, it is its slim roster size. There are currently only nine characters, and Riot has promised just one more to be added for launch. Ten isn’t even a lot even for a 1v1 fighter, but even worse for a tag fighter where you need to find two characters that fit your playstyle (unless, again, you decide to go with Juggernaut or Sidekick as your Fuses). And while that does suck, and leads to a lot of repetition where you’re fighting against the same characters and the same teams over and over again, it is a blow that is at least softened by the excellent design of that handful of characters. Whether it’s Ekko and his tricky clone mind games, Yasuo’s wild combo routes that have him stance-cancelling his way into bouncing his opponent all over the screen, Vi’s insane movement and whiff-punishing ability, or Illaoi’s tentacle set ups, these are some of the most fun fighting game characters I’ve ever played around with. And the beauty of it is that due to the flexibility of 2XKO’s combo and Fuse systems, rarely do I ever see any of these characters being played exactly the same way by two different people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, It’s still too early to call this a proper review of 2XKO because of all that we haven’t seen yet. There’s ranked mode, for instance, and that final tenth character on the launch roster – and I’ll definitely want to see how the free-to-play progression feels once the shops are more fully populated with cosmetics to purchase with in-game currency. But for now, 2XKO is shaping up to be one of the most exciting fighters on the horizon, during a time when there are <em>a lot </em>of exciting fighters on the horizon. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a senior guides producer at IGN.

There’s a Game Bar for navigating around, and a new task view that’s a lot more handheld-friendly.</p><p>You can also still swap into a Windows desktop mode, or access Windows apps and games directly in this full-screen Xbox mode. Microsoft warns that you’re exiting to the Windows desktop and that you should use touch or a mouse and keyboard “for the best experience,” and it’s the exact same Windows experience that exists on multiple devices right now.</p><p>If you want to try this out for yourself, it’s a relatively easy process to get going. But be warned, fiddling with registry settings or the Windows Feature Store (known as Velocity) could result in system instability. If you’re willing to risk some issues that might need rolling back or require a reinstall of Windows, there’s a handy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/">guide on Reddit</a> for all the settings required.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Hope you like owning multiple copies of the same game</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's that time of the year folks. The weather's getting colder, the days are getting shorter, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape From Tarkov</a> is getting Tweeted and Skeeted about again because of a controversial decision. This time, it's because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-now-its-full-release-is-imminent-as-confirmed-by-a-picture-of-a-random-bloke-ironing">game is coming to Steam</a>, which in and of itself is a perfectly fine, perhaps even smart thing to do. The thing that's being called into question however, is the answer to a question on the Steam release's FAQ page about whether or not you'll have to buy it again.
</p>
<p>
"To play Escape from Tarkov through Steam, you must purchase any edition of the game on Steam," the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">FAQ page</a> explains. "You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam."
</p>
<p>
It then provides an example, noting that if you buy the standard edition on Steam, but your Battlestate Games account has the Unheard Edition, that's the one you'll be able to play on Steam. That's… something? I just can't see any particular reason you'd want to buy the game again aside from Steam Deck functionality, except the FAQ also notes that "Battlestate Games [have] no plans to support a version of the game for Steam Deck," so you can throw that reason out of the window. There will be Steam achievements if that's something you care about?
</p>
<p>
All of your character progress will carry over to the Steam version of the game as well, once you've linked your Battlestate Games account, and you'll still be playing on the same servers as people who bought the game on its official website.
</p><p>
I have no idea how easy it would be to guarantee every single person who owns the game a copy on Steam as well, but it still feels like an odd choice in general. In any case, after being in early access for close to a decade, the full version of the game launches in a couple months' time on November 15th.

<p>When I was a child, <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fsimcity_2000_special_edition"><em>SimCity 2000</em></a> felt like a fun, animated set of urban-themed Lego blocks to tinker with. Revisiting the game roughly three decades later, though, I've found the weight of my adult responsibilities tempering my role as god-mayor of a tiny metropolis.</p>
<p>The tough economics of establishing a thriving city barely concerned me as a child. Rather than building up a durable tax base from a slowly growing city of happy citizens, I'd usually <a href="https://gamegenie.com/cheats/mac/SimCity2000.html">type in an infinite money cheat</a> or load up the handy <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2422/simcity-2000-urban-renewal-kit/">Urban Renewal Kit expansion</a> to build whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Thus unleashed, my childhood self would go mad with unchecked power, petulantly turning dials just to see what happened to the citizens in my virtual ant farm. Sometimes I'd try to arrange a repeating grid of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/wp43ua/sim_city_2000_arcology/">fancy arcologies</a> and police stations, trying to create a regimented utopia out of the game's most expensive (and therefore "best") building type. More often, I'd play with the far edges of the simulation, crowding residential areas next to polluting heavy industry or letting entire neighborhoods go without fire protection and waiting to see how long it took for things to fall apart.</p>
<p>Coming back to <em>SimCity 2000</em> today, I find it much harder to callously play with the lives of my virtual citizens. The years I've spent as a homeowner, parent, and city-dwelling adult make me at least pause before I willingly inflict that kind of pain on my tiny subjects.</p>
<p>As a child, I'd think nothing of temporarily cranking up property taxes just to pay for a pet project; now, it makes me think of my own slowly rising property tax bill. As a child, I saw the "legalized gambling" ordinance as an easy hack to fill in a budget gap in a struggling city; now, I think about all the attendant problems that would come if my town suddenly became a gambling mecca.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Today, when I hear the game's traffic chopper constantly complaining about snarled roads, I think of all the times I've been sitting in traffic, cursing city planners who don't invest enough in mass transit. Likewise, when I see a sim-neighborhood blighted by blackened, abandoned buildings, I think of the similar struggling areas I've seen dotting cities I've lived in.</p>
<h2>Trade-offs</h2>
<p>Playing <em>SimCity 2000</em> as an adult forces me to sit and think about what I consider important in a livable environment in a way I couldn't fully process as a child.</p>

<p>Can I live my values by sparing some money in a tight budget for homeless shelters or anti-smoking initiatives? Should I trust my police captain when he says crime is out of control, or should I wonder if he's just protecting his own livelihood? Do I really want to spend more money and land space on solar power plants, or is a little pollution from the cheaper coal plant worth the trade-off?</p>
<p>While these kinds of decisions plague me now in a way they never did as a child, the trade-offs I don't have to make in <em>SimCity 2000</em> also stand out. If I want to build a train line in <em>SimCity 2000</em>, I can literally pause time and just drag the tracks across the entirety of downtown. Here in the real world of suburban DC, I've watched as <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/traffic/mission-metro/purple-line-construction-delays-cause-problems-businesses/65-4247f929-4432-441b-ac70-dac568560994">construction of the Purple Line light rail has dragged on outside my window for years</a>, snarling traffic and <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/dc-purple-line-cost-overruns-delays-continue">running up costs in the process</a>.</p>
<p>I understand why a game like <em>SimCity</em> doesn't force you to wait multiple in-game years to level a mountain or build a long bridge, for instance. But the idealized construction speeds shown here do give a skewed view of urban development that can be seductive in its simplicity.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          

<h2>Retro-future</h2>
<p>Speaking of seductive simplicity, the retro-futurism of <em>SimCity 2000</em>'s look and feel is still compelling after all this time. As a child, I remember being immediately put off by the look of the original <em>SimCity</em>, with its garish EGA colors, complicated user interface, and overly rigid, stylized overhead grid map. By contrast, the bright SVGA colors, angular hills, flowing waterfalls, and isometric skyscrapers of <em>SimCity 2000</em> felt, at the time, like the future implied by its title.</p>

<p>Now that the year 2000 is a quarter-century in the past, there are definitely some UI touches that feel downright archaic, though. Years of quickly dragging and zooming through the likes of Google Maps and smartphone photos makes it feel incredibly awkward to use the much rougher camera tools in <em>SimCity 2000</em>. I found myself constantly wishing for the ability to turn the camera in increments less than 90 degrees or to have access to a more fine-grained zoom control.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard to deny the charm of seeing these tiny pixel-art buildings popping up like weeds from a carefully manicured zoning plot, fed by electricity, water, and nearby services you've set up. As a responsible adult, I want to do right by the tiny citizens in those tiny virtual houses and create a living space for them where they can build a life worth living.</p>
<p>But I'd be lying if my inner child didn't just want to unleash a tornado on virtual downtown sometimes...</p>

            <p>
There are few occasions where a game tells me it's combining two genres that typically don't go together and it convinces me it's worth paying attention to, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/blanksword">Blanksword</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> RPG, is quite different. In it, you are Blank, an angel stabbed in the head, brain destroyed, who somehow managed to survive such an ordeal - albeit without any memory of who you were. And now, you are on a quest through a series of islands governed by "Literally God" in order to figure out your mysterious past.
</p>
<p>
Blanksword has been in the works for a little while now, but a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/283910083/blanksword">Kickstarter for the game just went live today</a>. Taking one look at the game tells you quite quickly that it's "one of those" kinds of indie RPGs. You like, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hylics">Hylics</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a>, or the blueprint for many of them, and one that just recently got a rerelease, OFF.

<p>
In fact OFF is quite an important frame of reference for Blanksword, as one of the game's directors, Quinn K., was the original translator for OFF. Not only that, but OFF creator Mortis Ghost is responsible for the game's lovely key art, and may even design an area of the game if the Kickstarter raises enough funds.
</p><p>
The mechanics sound quite interesting too. Combat, like many RPGs, is turn-based, and you pick up new moves as you go along, all of which vary from run to run. There's apparently "hundreds" of moves to pickup, alongside different bits of equipment and items.
</p>
<p>
And then there's that beautiful thing we call narrative design. With Blank not having a brain and all, you can pick up different Angelic Brain Parts, restoring certain abilities of his. One item might allow Blank to intimidate and heckle his enemies, another will give him the ability to tell if something smells bad. Others might let him understand more complex topics, or grant him the ability to haggle for better prices in certain shops. You keep these brain parts forever, but you can only use a few at a time to keep things balanced.
</p>
<p>
Best of all, alongside the Kickstarter the game has a demo out on Steam for you to try out. Truth be told, while I've had my eye on Blanksword for a good while, I somehow missed that it was a roguelike on top of an RPG. Playing the demo for myself, I soon figured this out, but the roguelike element blended really nicely with the RPG side of it. They aren't genres you often see combined, and in some ways could even be contradictory, but in my short time with it, I think something quite interesting is being brewed up. Here's hoping the full game pans out just as well.
</p>
<p>
Blanksword's "one of those" indie RPG vibes make it feel quite well positioned for a future fanatical following, a thing that's often both a blessing and a curse. That all remains to be seen of course, the game needs to get funded first.
</p>
<p>
A release date hasn't been set just yet, but the team behind it has conservatively estimated a 2027 release window. You can wishlist it, and try the demo out, on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484670/Blanksword/">here</a>.

              <p>The controversy surrounding the DLC clans in the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> 2</a> is finally over. The studio behind the upcoming game has confirmed that it is walking back its plans to lock two clans behind a paywall after receiving lots of “feedback,” aka people yelled at them online for a while.</p> <p>Last month,<em> Bloodlines 2</em> devs The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom ONL</a> that the long-awaited vampire RPG sequel would finally arrive on PC and consoles in October. After a lengthy and messy development cycle that involved multiple studios and delays, a lot of fans were just happy that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> was actually, for real, coming out.&nbsp; But then folks discovered that <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-day-1-dlc-clans-2000618832">two of the game’s six vampire clans, which essentially act as your class, were locked behind a $30 paywall.</a> People got mad, a lot of negative headlines were posted, and about a week later, on August 27, the devs announced they were <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dlc-clans-locked-paywall-2000620705">going to make some tweaks to the DLC plans</a>. And now we know what that means: All six clans are included in the base game.</p> <p>On September 17, in the YouTube description of a new <em>Bloodlines 2</em> gameplay overview trailer, the executive producer on the game thanked fans for the “frank feedback” about the game’s Premium Edition DLC before confirming that none of the clans would be locked behind a day-one DLC paywall. He also praised the devs for helping create two new story packs that will now be included in the Premium Edition.</p>

  <p>“Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on <em>Bloodlines 2</em> and the Premium Edition,” said<em> Bloodlines 2</em> executive producer Marco Behrmann. “That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing. We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.”</p> <p>The two new story packs are: “Loose Cannon“ (Brujah Sheriff Benny’s story) and “The Flower &amp; The Flame” (Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s path). The plan is for this DLC, which replaces the missing paid access to clans, to launch in 2026. And so ends the B<em>loodlines 2</em> DLC saga. Hopefully, after all of this and all the years of waiting, the game is worth it all. We’ll find out when <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 l</em>aunches on Xbox, PS5, and PC on October 21.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/months-after-microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-unions-never-stopped-fighting-for-impacted-workers.1300881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July, Microsoft <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 9,100 employees</a> across the company, in particular gutting numerous games teams and leading to a cascade of high-profile project cancellations that included <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, and an unannounced MMO from <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> creator Zenimax Online Studios. In the months following, unionized workers at the latter – as well as the Zenimax QA union, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first video game studio union at Microsoft</a> – have refused to simply roll over and accept their fates.&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning in mid-July, Zenimax QA union members picketed outside the studio’s Rockville, Maryland office on a weekly basis until late August, just before unionized employees’ final day in early September, to show support for laid-off colleagues.</p><p>"Our hopes always are to show the company that there's power in the collective and that we can all come together as a company and show them that not just one person doesn't like what they're doing, but that the whole lot of us don't like it,” QA union member and, as of early September, former associate tester Aubrey Litchfield told Aftermath. “To show solidarity amongst all of our members as well. I think it's very important in that there's power in having that collaboration with all of the other unions that are part of our company."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It's going to be an ongoing effort for game workers to continuously push back against the layoff machine that is the games industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"We had a great turnout,” union member and now-former QA tester Jessee Leese, also impacted by recent layoffs, told Aftermath. “It was really great to see coworkers on the line,&nbsp; both people who had not been affected by the layoffs and were standing in solidarity and then people like myself who had been affected by the layoffs, because yeah, that's the best thing I can be doing with my time right now: picketing. ... This is definitely not the last we've seen of layoffs – not at Zenimax or in the larger industry of games and technology – so it's going to be an ongoing effort for game workers to continuously push back against the layoff machine that is the games industry."</p><p>As part of their contract, which was <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized shortly before the layoffs</a>, the QA union had previously secured a stipulation that Microsoft had to let those affected stick around and bargain for 60 days instead of just laying them off immediately. In addition to a contractually obligated severance package calculated off higher base pay than the days prior to the union’s existence, that meant more pay and runway in the intervening period.</p><p>“Without the union, they could have just laid us off, and our last end date would have been July 2, and that would have been it,” said Litchfield. “But the union allows us two months of bargaining, so it allowed us 60 days to negotiate with the company to attempt to get better severance packages and all of that stuff. Granted, the company is going to do what it wants to do in the end, but it at least allowed our members to have that two months of a continuance period where we were able to keep getting paid during that time."</p><p>While Microsoft proved difficult to budge in terms of severance and rehirings for full-time employees, the union was able to secure a better severance deal for contractors, who – until the formation of a contractor union in 2023 and subsequent bargaining that got contractors upgraded to temporary Microsoft employees – were not even told when their contracts were scheduled to conclude. "What we were told when we were hired was [to] just keep logging in until you can't log in anymore,” said Litchfield. “Nobody actually knew when their contract ended. It would just end, and then you'd get a phone call."</p><p>Recent bargaining on the part of the QA union has improved things even further.</p><p>"We have guaranteed and pretty generous severance that everyone will be receiving, including temp workers, [of which] I am one," said Leese.</p><p>The multidisciplinary <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenimax Online Studios union</a>, which is still bargaining for a contract, managed to build on the QA union’s contract structure, effectively winning laid-off colleagues two additional months of pay as a result of ongoing negotiations.</p><p>"We were able to extend out [laid-off workers] impacted period, because their timers didn't even start until we signed the memorandum of understanding [about the layoffs],” Alyssa Gobelle, senior motion graphics artist and Zenimax Online Studios union bargaining committee member, told Aftermath. “Even their 60 days of continued employment and pending termination notices didn't happen until that ink was signed. So instead of starting July 2, that started mid-August, so that essentially bought them a lot more weeks of pay and healthcare security while we figured this out. That's sort of a soft win in a way, because obviously [it's] not in the contract, but it was an impact of us being able to bargain. We were able to buy them more time."</p><figure><blockquote><p>They really cut too many people with this last round of layoffs. There are multiple teams that are in overtime for the first time in ages. ... It's going to result in cost ineffectiveness and burnout overall.</p></blockquote></figure><p>As a result, ZOS union members who lost their jobs in July technically remain employed until October. The ZOS union also squeezed an additional four weeks minimum severance out of Microsoft, bringing the total up to eight weeks across the board. On top of all that, the union also secured 18 months of recall rights for everyone on the canceled Zenimax MMO that lost their jobs, meaning that if there’s a relevant job opening at Zenimax Online Studios, there’s now a chance that workers who’ve been let go will get their old jobs back – as opposed to the company throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>The Zenimax Online Studios union managed to save a small handful of jobs, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>"25 people were given the chance to transfer over [from the canceled MMO to <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>],” said Gobelle. “I don't think everybody took it, but those that did take the transfer option to come back, they're all back."</p><p>"We were able to bring back temporary employees that were for some reason furloughed and then told basically that they would get a paycheck and not do work,” she added, referring to a different group of employees. “They are at least able to work out their contracts and depart with proper dignity."</p><p>Recalls might prove necessary, because Microsoft absolutely took the hatchet to Zenimax. QA lost 105 people – 75 employees and 30 contractors, amounting to a third of total QA – according to Litchfield, while Zenimax Online Studios’ headcount was reduced by over 200, according to Gobelle. Another Microsoft worker who was granted anonymity as they are not authorized to speak publicly on these matters told Aftermath that higher-ups have said internally that a total of 1,600 positions were eliminated from Microsoft’s gaming division during July’s layoffs. Litchfield and Leese told Aftermath they’d heard the same.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Microsoft and Zenimax for additional details but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>"Regardless of what the employer claims, they really cut too many people with this last round of layoffs,” said Leese. “There are multiple teams that are in overtime for the first time in ages, and it's explicitly because of these cuts. We're seeing a lot of people who are scrambling to get things done in ways that they weren't previously. There's just too many tasks for not enough hands. Deadlines are definitely going to be missed in order for the remaining workers to be keeping up with this. It's going to result in cost ineffectiveness and burnout overall."&nbsp;</p><p>The two Zenimax unions are now helping those who’ve been let go find ways to land on their feet.</p><p>"There's Discord channels dedicated to everybody that was affected, from 343 Studios to Zenimax to all of the Xbox divisions,” said Litchfield. “We all come together to help each other look over resumes and post jobs that we might be able to give references [for]. … There's this community piece of it that I think is really not talked about enough as far as unions go. A lot of the time when you're laid off, you just get laid off, and that's that. You never talk to your coworkers again. There's this sense of community that's brought on by having a union and believing in your cause and knowing that one day, things are going to change. You're not going to stand there and let a company take advantage of you."&nbsp;</p><p>"We have so many meetups and individual connections with each other, understanding people on a personal level and understanding people's needs,” said Leese. “We've been there for each other as emotional support [and] financial support when people are saying that they are going to need help with things. I've seen so many people be very quick to say that they're willing to fund some medical emergencies or family emergencies – general issues people need help with. We take care of each other."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I've seen so many people be very quick to say that they're willing to fund some medical emergencies or family emergencies. ... We take care of each other.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Which is important, because it’s rough out there.</p><p>"The job market is abysmal right now,” said Litchfield. “The current administration likes to say it's booming, but it's not. It's horrible. [Microsoft] did provide us with job transitioning services. However, it's a little laughable because they just push LinkedIn a lot and cold-connecting with people on LinkedIn. ... Everything is powered by AI right now, so our resumes go through an AI machine that filters out whether we're good candidates or not, and they look for keywords. So it's been very helpful to get people [in our union Discords] that are like 'No, no, you need this [keyword] in there.'"</p><p>Leese is broadening her horizons beyond the video game industry. Organizing, she’s realized, is where her passions lie.</p><p>"I decided when we unionized that nothing I have ever done, including the extremely amazing and exclusive industry of video games, compares to the satisfaction of watching workers get what they deserve,” she said. “So I have decided to move into full-time union organizing, and I am pursuing job opportunities that relate to that career goal rather than video game work."</p><p>She'd like to continue helping game workers organize if she can, though.</p><p>"This industry is so special, and it has so many new things that we as workers can take hold of and grab by the horns and make decisions about like AI, outsourcing, layoffs, crediting policies, and transparency at studios,” Leese said. “We can decide what the standards are. We don't have to stand by and let the employers decide one wave at a time."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Paul Walter Hauser, an actor who you probably know from the Apple TV+ series Black Bird, has joined Zach Creggar's upcoming Resident Evil movie, according to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/paul-walter-hauser-austin-abrams-resident-evil-zach-cregger-1236546153/">Deadline</a>. Creggar co-wrote the film with John Wick writer Shay Hatten, and he'll also be directing it following his critical hit from this year, Weapons.</p>



<p>Hauser is the second actor to publicly join the project, after Wolfs actor Austin Abrams was reported to be taking part in the <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-austin-abrams-zach-cregger-1236346563/">film earlier this year.</a> The new movie is due to arrive on September 18, 2026, though at the time of this writing we don't have a strong idea as to what the plot of the film will be, or who else will be joining Hauser and Abrams in the cast.</p>



<p>What we do know about the story, according to what Creggar told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/zach-cregger-interview-resident-evil-weapons">Inverse</a> in an interview, is that is won't be a Leon Kennedy-based story. Creggar is looking to tell "<em>a different story</em>" compared to the games, but doesn't want fans to be concerned that his film won't be a Resident Evil story.</p>



<p>"<em>It is obedient to the lore of the games, it’s just a different story</em>. <em>I’m not going to tell Leon’s story, because Leon’s story is told in the games. [Fans] already have that.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Let me say this: this is not breaking the rules of the games</em>. <em>I am the biggest worshiper of the games, so I’m telling a story that is a love letter to the games and follows the rules of the games.</em>"</p>



<p>In other Resident Evil news, ahead of Creggar's film, fans of the series can look forward to Resident Evil Requiem arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">February 27, 2026</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Theme Park Management Game Based On Mars Attacks! Is Here And It’s Good]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-attracts-theme-park-sim-builder-review-early-access-aliens-steam-2000626562</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-theme-park-management-game-based-on-mars-attacks-is-here-and-it%E2%80%99s-good.1300872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, I didn’t have this on my 2025 bingo card, which is a thing I assume we all have. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-video-game-mars-attracts-theme-park-burton-1851629159">There’s a <em>Mars Attacks!</em> video game out this week on PC</a>, and more surprisingly, it’s a really fun, if somewhat rough around the edges, theme park management game that plays a lot like a sci-fi spin on <em>Zoo Tycoon</em> and <em>Two Point Hospital. </em></p> <p>Cleverly titled <em>Mars Attracts,</em> this newly released theme park management sim lets you abduct humans from throughout history and build a theme park around displaying them like animals while also experimenting on them in horrible ways for science. And also to provide entertainment to your depraved Martian guests. And after spending a few hours with <em>Mars Attracts,</em> I’m both excited to play more and also disturbed by how quickly I turned on humanity in the pursuit of building the coolest theme park on Mars.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mars-attracts"><em>Mars Attracts</em></a> isn’t based on the ’90s <em>Mars Attacks</em> movie directly, but instead is based on the original trading cards that inspired Tim Burton’s cult classic film, so don’t expect Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker to pop up at any point. Instead, <em>Mars Attracts</em> uses the OG card art and lore as its foundation to build out a wild theme park management simulator. And all of the new in-game art created for<em> Mars Attracts</em> is fantastic, perfectly emulating the old look of the cards. I really want some of these loading screen and pause menu images printed out as big posters.</p>

  <p>So what do you do in <em>Mars Attracts</em>? Well, you build theme parks. But it’s not as simple as plopping down some paths, food stalls, trash cans, and rides, and calling it a day. The Martians in <em>Mars Attracts</em> are coming to your park to see different human beings from various points in history, like the Wild West and Ancient Rome. Through the use of time travel and UFOs, you send off aliens to go collect humans and items from a given time period, which you then place in exhibits. And while you have some humans collected, you might as well run experiments on them. Not only does this please many of your guests, but it also helps you earn the various research currencies needed to unlock upgrades and new things to build. It’s a lot more fun than researching new tech in other park builders. In those games, I don’t even get to torture and kill one single human, let alone dozens.</p> <p>Of course, the humans you collect aren’t going to be happy about this situation, so you’ll need to make sure you keep their enclosure clean and filled with food troughs and water dispensers, and not poke and prod them too much. If a human gets too angry and wants to break out, they just might, and you’ll need to call in security to stop them.</p>

 <p>And if you have an excess of human beings, you can also just dissect them and use their parts to build new kiosks and entertainment options for your guests. Want to provide your Martians with balloons made out of human lungs? You can do just that, once you’ve killed enough humans. If this all sounds morbid and disgusting, don’t worry. <em>Mars Attracts</em> features a cartoonish and silly aesthetic that makes it easy to have a good time while torturing your human captives.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626566">©</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Mars Attracts</em> is currently in early access on Steam, and while I didn’t experience any annoying bugs or crashes while building out my incredible parks across the game’s first few starting zones, I did notice some missing text and a lack of sound effects. There’s just a general sense that the game isn’t finished yet, which is exactly what I would expect from an early access indie game. I also felt like some parts of the in-game economy felt grindy, and it can be annoying managing supplies when it feels like your workers aren’t doing what you expect. So if you prefer your games to be more feature-complete, perfectly balanced, and…well…finished, then you might want to wait.</p> <p>For everyone else, if you love building out wacky hospitals in <em>Two Point</em> or building elaborate parks in <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em>, I’d definitely recommend<em> Mars Attracts</em>. It’s the weirdest theme park builder I’ve played in a long time, but also a fantastic spin on the genre that sci-fi fans and <em>Mars Attacks</em> lovers will enjoy for hours and hours.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-review.1300842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put over 100 hours into Donkey Kong Bananza since July. I reached 100% completion on my first playthrough, did a zero-banana run on my second, and I’ve been using a third to practice crazy speedrun techniques and push DK’s incredible movement in more extreme ways. Two months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">giving Bananza a 10 in my original review</a>, I remain in awe of how DK’s frenetic, destructive abilities work masterfully in tandem with the underground’s meticulously-designed breakable environments. Nintendo nailed the relationship between Bananza’s world and its main character, and the new DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC is a really fun excuse to keep experimenting in this playground in a remixed, more frantic way, even if a slight lack of content and a few minor issues keep it from reaching the same inspired heights as the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get too far into things, a quick note. Bananza’s DLC is only accessible after clearing the main story, and it acts as somewhat of an extended postgame. I’m not going to outright spoil Bananza here, but if you’re still drilling your way to the planet core and don’t want to know anything about it, you may want to come back to this review once you’ve reached the end credits. That said, you should also do so <em>before </em>you dive too far past them, because the DLC makes some helpful changes to the original endgame grind that you may want to know about. There are two intertwined halves of the DLC to discuss: DK Island is a new level to explore, while Emerald Rush is a roguelite take on Bananza that makes up the majority of the content found in this combined package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DK Island is a wonderful love letter to Rare’s Donkey Kong Country trilogy and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/25/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. It’s a nostalgic return to where DK platformers really began, comparable to exploring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/09/26/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>’s Mushroom Kingdom in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a>’s postgame. It’s overflowing with great references, from obvious ones like DK’s treehouse and King K. Rool’s Gangplank Galleon from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/20/donkey-kong-country-review">Donkey Kong Country</a>, to deeper cuts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/29/donkey-kong-country-2-review">DKC 2</a>’s goal target tucked away in the corner on the ship’s main deck. As a huge fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/donkey-kong-jungle-beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> – the last DK platformer Nintendo developed internally prior to Bananza – my favorite part of DK Island has to be the bongos out at sea. There are so many more references to DK history I don’t want to give away, but if you have any love for this series, you’ll probably get a kick out of discovering all its easter eggs too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, though, there’s actually not that much to do on DK Island. There are no Banandium Gems or fossils to hunt down and no challenge rooms to conquer. Instead, the gold bonus stages found in Bananza’s main layers are all collected here, making DK Island a convenient place to grind for cash. Bananza’s original postgame sees Grumpy Kong demanding tens of thousands of gold pieces to unlock some of the final collectibles and reach 100% completion, and those who have access to DK Island will have a much easier time grinding than I did before the DLC was out. Elsewhere, DK’s old parrot companion Squawks is here, and he will hunt down one of DK Island’s dozens of collectible statues in exchange for Banandium Chips. Shiny replicas of Bananza’s allies, enemies, and Kongs live in galleries across DK Island, adding to its value as a nostalgic DK history museum. In classic Bananza fashion, you can pick them up, turf surf on them, and use them to carve through the island’s central mountain. You’ll need to grind thousands of Banandium Chips to buy them all, but thankfully, those are the main reward of the Emerald Rush mode. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK Island is a rush of nostalgia, but there's actually not that much to do.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides DK Island’s role as a rush of 90s nostalgia and a place to store cool trinkets, there’s not much to it, and I wouldn’t recommend buying the DLC if you’re only interested in this component. It’s a little<em> </em>odd that DK Island wasn’t included as a postgame reward in the base game since it’s so comparable to Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom, and gating it behind paid DLC feels kind of like a money-hungry move from Nintendo. This is the company that just charged $10 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, though, so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised at this somewhat eyeroll-worthy choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Bananza’s DLC does a much better job justifying its $20 price tag in its Emerald Rush mode. Void Kong has found his way to DK Island, and he’s moved on from his obsession with Banandium Gold to set his sights on a new prize: emerald ore… which is the exact same, but green. Void hires DK and Pauline to collect as much emerald ore as possible, and this introduction includes some cute followups and resolutions for Bananza’s main story and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen some online chatter calling Emerald Rush a simple minigame that should have been free, but it’s much more than that: it’s a fully-featured side mode that turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a fun, replayable roguelite. Each run takes place across a series of rounds – ranging from six to 15 depending on the difficulty level selected – where you have 100 seconds to reach a quota of emerald ore to pay Void. If you don’t reach the goal, your run comes to an end right there. If you do, you can keep working on your build for the rest of the timer to stock up for the next round, where the quota progressively multiples. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Emerald Rush feels like a combination of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>’s Salmon Run and Side Order modes. Personality-wise, it clearly takes inspiration from Salmon Run: both feature a hilariously mean boss screaming at you to meet your quota through a walkie talkie over increasingly difficult rounds. This is also Nintendo’s first take on a roguelite since last year’s excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-review">Side Order DLC for Splatoon 3</a> which, notably, also came bundled with a nostalgic hub to explore. It feels like Donkey Kong is following the exact same playbook, as Emerald Rush features dozens of perks that impact your score multiplier in a very similar fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each run of Emerald Rush begins by stripping DK of all his skills – including his five Bananza transformations at higher difficulties – and it’s up to you to power him back up while also gathering piles of emerald ore. This is done by frantically exploring layers, fast traveling around with a limited number of barrel cannons, collecting emerald bananas and fossils that restore DK’s skills and give you the choice of one of three perks, and completing goals Void Kong assigns you at specific locations across the map. I love starting from nothing, giving me a place to put all of DK’s high-level base techniques to use, and I found I was able to reach a lot of areas in really cool, satisfying ways – for example, using a chunk to essentially quadruple jump to a platform I traditionally would have used Ostrich Bananza to reach. Emerald Rush challenges advanced players to go for the highest score possible, and there’s always room to grow by deepening your understanding of how DK moves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Emerald Rush turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a frantic, replayable roguelite.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But even if you’re not interested in crazy parkour tricks, the most important part of Emerald Rush are the perks that alter how much emerald ore appears. There are generic power-ups like generating more when defeating a certain type of enemy, but the most exciting ways to score are the Groove subset of perks, which revolve around multipliers that increase the more you perform a specific action. For instance, my favorite is Turf Groove, where more emerald ore appears based on the total distance traveled by Turf Surfing. The second this perk shows up, my whole playstyle changes. Suddenly, I’m trying to get everywhere by Turf Surfing, which is a big challenge on denser layers. Emerald Rush leads to scenarios you’d never see in the base game, and with such an incredible foundation to build a roguelite on, it’s always fun seeing how you can push the mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking multiple perks like this on top of each other can lead to completely busted results, and I scored well over one million points on a few runs where my target goal was less than half that. If you thought the base game had a lot happening on-screen at once, Emerald Rush achieves a new level of unregulated chaos, like one run where I got tons of bonus emerald ore for defeating enemies as Zebra Bananza, leading to 30 minutes of sprinting around nonstop, destroying everything in sight to flood the screen with an overwhelming, borderline unbelievable amount of emerald ore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not always a breeze, though. Like most roguelites, a lot of your success depends on what skills randomly show up, and I lost multiple runs by banking on a certain Bananza to spawn by building my perks around it, and ultimately failing when it never arrived. Speaking of Bananzas, Emerald Rush really rewards mastery over these five powered-up forms, as knowing the best way to take advantage of their unique strengths and swapping between them on the fly results in a high skill ceiling fitting of an endgame mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish Emerald Rush went a little bit further with its abilities, though. Seeing big numbers get bigger is always enjoyable, and the way Emerald Rush overlays your multiplier onto every individual explosion is a nice touch – but with a few rare exceptions, there are no brand new abilities to find, and the perks simply make DK’s already-existing moves worth more points. It changes the scoring and the way you play, but beyond reclaiming powers I’m already very used to using in the base game, it never meaningfully expands the options available to you. The best roguelites make you feel more powerful throughout a run by giving you fresh moves as you go, and adding more exciting techniques to DK’s toolkit could have elevated this from a good roguelite mode to a great one.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation. New content is all that counts, so the enhanced editions of the Zeldas aren't included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing runs earns you piles of Banandium Chips and rating points that unlock cute bonus costumes, more powerful perks in the rotation, and new layers to tackle. Emerald Rush doesn’t take place in new areas besides DK Island. Instead, DK and Pauline return to familiar locations from Bananza’s campaign, and one of the coolest parts of this mode is how it rewards you for being intimately familiar with these layers. Emerald versions of Banandium Gems and fossils are found in the same locations as their counterparts in the main campaign, and knowing exactly where to find a vein of three fossils or a bunch of bananas makes Emerald Rush feel like a cool B-side to the main story. And, the Getaways you’ve built during the main story become essential fast travel points during a run, further incentivizing you to explore each layer to the fullest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, Void Kong’s objective will sometimes vaguely order you to do something like give Cranky Kong a high five, or take a swim in a layer that doesn’t have much water in it. Unlike the usual orders, these objectives don’t place a marker on your map, leaving it up to you to find them on your own. Thanks to my 100+ hours and multiple playthroughs, it didn’t take long for me to pinpoint Cranky hanging out on a big tree branch in the Forest Layer, or to find a quick pond to dive into in the Hilltop Layer. I initially thought reusing areas from the base game would be a weakness of Emerald Rush, but the way it leverages your knowledge of familiar locations is a really smart, novel way to effectively reuse old content.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this is another place I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh. There are no new enemy types, and it never introduces boss encounters that could’ve nicely broken up the pace of runs that last up to 45 minutes. I reached the end credits after about six hours, and while the DLC’s postgame opens up several more layers to play Emerald Rush in, I’m starting to feel a little burnt out on the formula. I’ll probably only stick around to reach 100% completion out of obligation to the base game I’ve so thoroughly completed. And when I do return, I’ll almost certainly throw on my own music or a podcast – the pair of main themes is undeniably catchy with flourishes from Pauline that change depending on your active transformation, but I could definitely go without hearing either for a while after 10 hours in the DLC. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The best part about Donkey Kong Bananza’s DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC is that it gives me a reason to keep experimenting in one of my favorite playgrounds Nintendo has ever created. DK Island is a nostalgic rush that prioritizes fun callbacks to Rare’s golden era over stuff to actually do. Despite the warm, fuzzy feelings I had while exploring, I can’t help but think this would have been more fitting as a final postgame reward in Bananza itself rather than DLC locked behind a paywall. But the bulk of this expansion is housed in Emerald Rush, which let me unleash DK’s craziest parkour possibilities and strategically balance each transformation’s strengths to set new high scores. Its perk system creates unique ways to play you’d never consider in the original campaign, and it smartly returns to old locations and tests your knowledge of important places in a way that feels like a fitting endgame counterpart to the main story. That said, I wish Emerald Rush had introduced more new abilities and enemies to keep me around a bit longer than the 10 hours I’ve put in so far. If you’re hungry for more DK and aren’t opposed to a remixed, roguelite formula, Emerald Rush is probably worth the additional investment. Otherwise, Bananza’s DLC is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>James Comer, a Republican representative from Kentucky and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has called on the CEOs of major game-adjacent and forum platforms to appear at an upcoming panel about online radicalization. Coming in the aftermath of the murder of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, Comer seeks testimony from the leadership at Valve, Discord, Twitch, and Reddit.</p><p>In a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Comer stated that government has a "duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence." Comer further explained that the CEOs must "explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purpose."</p><p>As such, the CEOs have each been sent letters requesting their presence at a House Oversight Committee hearing that will take place on October 8. According to the letters, the hearing will address "radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts."</p><p>Information released about the suspect in Kirk's murder suggests that he was an avid internet user and game player. In addition to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/charlie-kirk-suspect-online-memes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">engraving references to online memes</a> and, apparently, a Helldivers 2 button combination on shell casings, the suspect also extensively used Discord, had a Steam account, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/technology/charlie-kirk-meta-x-tiktok.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as "terminally online" by friends.</a> These pieces of evidence, combined with debate around online response in the immediate aftermath, have resulted in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/kirk-social-media-gop-trump-tiktok-meta-x-censorship-00564655" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">calls from conservative officials and media</a> to crack down on social media companies.</p><p>However, a research community already exists that has attempted to tease out the complex, sensitive, and multifaceted relationship between gaming cultures and communities and violent radicalization. In recent years, researchers (including myself) have devoted time and attention to studying gaming cultures and communities. Sparked by high-profile violent attacks whose perpetrators referenced gaming culture or were radicalized within games-adjacent social media, this research has focused on how socialization and relationship-building within the context of online games may interact with radicalization to violent extremism. For instance, I have worked for years with collaborators to investigate <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1410620/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how often game players are exposed to hate speech and harassment</a> within games, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1586566/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">niche communities of violent extremists on Steam</a>, and methods for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1537492/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">building resilience to radicalization among game communities</a>.</p><p>This research community has long been careful to focus on cultural and social dynamics and where they intersect with gaming broadly, and to communicate that there is little evidence of any direct link between gaming and violence. Video games are commonly targeted by influencers and policymakers after violent events, despite scant evidence as to a direct link between gameplay and violence. Social scientists have studied the effects of gaming since the 1990s and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxk7LMzUSQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found mixed results</a>, at most, for the controversial claims around games and violence.</p><p>Despite this caution and its focus on understanding exactly when, why, and whether violence in online communities occurs in gaming contexts, this research community has been significantly curtailed by recent initiatives by the current US administration. Much of my research, for instance, was funded by the Department of Homeland Security's Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention grant program, which was <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/120328/undoing-post-911-security-architecture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">significantly scaled back in July</a>. Other violence prevention research was funded by the National Institute for Health, which has also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02721-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">undergone severe cuts to its grantmaking efforts</a>.</p>
