            <p>
Sony has released its latest PlayStation 5 system software update, introducing shareable links so players can invite others to quickly jump into their multiplayer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Sony first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-shareable-links-will-let-recipients-join-multiplayer-games-without-being-psn-friends">revealed</a> it was working on shareable multiplayer links for PlayStation 5 back in May. And now, two and a bit months later, the feature (albeit seemingly with certain announced elements still to come) is here as part of the snappily titled 24.05-09.60.00 PS5 update.
</p>
<p>
"To invite other players [to a game]," explains Sony's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">patch notes</a>, "open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link." The company notes the feature only works for open sessions that anyone can join.

<p>
Away from shareable links, Sony's latest PS5 update adds the ability to open Game Help action cards using voice commands. Users just need to say "Show Game Help" to get started.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the company promises improved messages and usability on "some" screens, updated device software to improve stability for "some" DualSense wireless controllers, plus - because you can never have too much stability - improved system software performance and stability too. And if you prefer patch notes formatted as Sony orginally intended, see below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Version: 24.05-09.60.00</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can invite other players to game sessions by sharing a URL to the session. </li>
<ul>
<li>To invite other players, open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link.</li>
<li>This feature is available only for open sessions that anyone can join. </li>
<li>This feature will gradually be rolled out to all players by July 24.</li>
</ul>
<li>Voice Command now supports the ability to open Game Help action cards by saying "Show Game Help". </li>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Voice Command (Preview) is available only in English for players with accounts for PlayStation Network in the US and UK. </li>
<li>We've improved system software performance and stability. </li>
</ul>
<li>We've updated the device software of some DualSense wireless controllers to improve stability. </li>
<li>We've improved the messages and usability on some screens.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a great day to be an esports fan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially announced the creation of the Olympic Esports Games. Yes, this means video games will now be a part of the Olympics.</p>



<p>The news came earlier today (July 23, 2024) while being presented live by the IOC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-esports-have-officially-joined-the-olympics">Esports have Officially Joined the Olympics</h2>



<p>As the world of esports and gaming continues to grow, fans should expect to see massive feats, like today’s, in the future. With the IOC officially recognizing esports as an Olympic sport, the future of gaming looks to only be going upwards.</p>



<p>The 142 IOC Session voted today on whether or not esports should come to the Olympics. With zero voters voting <em>no</em> and zero <em>abstentions</em>, the entire committee voted <em>yes</em><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span>for video games to now be a part of the Olympic games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news arrives amidst the Esports World Cup 2024 being held in Saudi Arabia. While many are excited about this historic moment, it is important to remember that not just <em>any </em>game will be recognized in the Olympics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ioc-sets-rules-for-esports-in-the-olympics-excluding-first-person-shooters">IOC Sets Rules for Esports in the Olympics, Excluding First-person Shooters</h2>



<p>While esports joining the Olympic Games is a historic feat, there are still a few exceptions regarding different games. First off, not just every big esports game will be included. In fact, there will be zero first-person shooter games.</p>



<p>Games such as Valorant, Counter-Strike and Call of Duty will be excluded. This also has led people to wonder whether or not third-person shooters, such as Fortnite, will be included.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Last year, the Olympics hosted an esports tournament that featured Fortnite Creative, leading many to wonder what the Battle Royale’s role will be moving forward (if it has one).</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of games that will be involved in the Olympic Esports Games:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Street Fighter</li>



<li>Tekken</li>



<li>iRacing</li>



<li>NBA2K</li>



<li>FIFA</li>
</ul>



<p>There will also be various mobile games included, but none specified. As the years go by, though, more and more games could be added.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nobody Wants to Die Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-wants-to-die-review.935214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nobody Wants to Die starts at a drive-thru theater, our protagonist James taking in a black and white movie with his wife Rachel. You spend this peaceful moment joking around with her through conversation options amidst the pouring rain, but that respite is quickly destroyed. Rachel vanishes and the scene zooms out to reveal the dark, 24th century hellscape where James lives. It’s a great setup, showcasing everything you need to know about this moody cyberpunk detective noir. The world might be familiar, but the developers at Critical Hit Games have managed to fill it with fun details and a few moments that flip your expectations. Unfortunately, that strong start doesn’t <em>quite</em> hold up throughout Nobody Wants to Die’s roughly six-hour runtime; there’s a bit too much hand-holding during its investigation scenes, and it’s missing important features that would make its branching story structure easier to explore. But what it might lack in polish it makes up for in style. </p><p>Nobody Wants to Die is a story you’ve probably seen before: James is a detective with a tragic past he doesn’t remember, and who drowns himself in booze to dull the pain in a city full of flying cars, giant holographic ads, and buildings so tall you can’t see the ground. When he’s pulled into a case that ends up being bigger than he could’ve ever imagined, both his will and his skills as a detective are put to the test as he gets caught in a conspiratorial plot. On paper, it looks pretty basic; maybe even outright boring. And there are moments where it does stick to that script a bit too much.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nobody Wants to Die Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But this isn’t just any detective story; it’s a cyberpunk neo-noir that isn’t shy about its artistic and narrative influences. There’s a lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/altered-carbon-season-1-review">Altered Carbon</a> in its premise, specifically in how people can swap bodies after death (or just whenever they want). The sleek, jaw-dropping aesthetic is very reminiscent of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/29/blade-runner-2049-review">Blade Runner</a>, but with a 1950s Dark City pastiche instead of a Japanese one. It’s also not hard to see some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a> here, both in its basic cyberpunk elements and in how you can reconstruct crime scenes with gadgets that run on technobabble. Of course, there’s also the early 20th century detective noir of it all — complete with femme fatales, constant rain, lots of alcohol, and monologues from James that straddle the line between perfectly melodramatic and a bit too over the top. It’s true greasy, wet pulp.</p><p>Critical Hit Games wears an “eat the rich” attitude on its sleeve. The body swapping system seemingly allows for immortality, but you have to purchase a subscription when you come of age. If you can’t afford it, you’ll get arrested, with your brain put into “bank” storage; if you’re rich, you can just buy new bodies and switch out whenever you want. Sadly, the class warfare this concept enticingly establishes is mostly just used to move the plot along. It’s more an opportunity to call the rich “assholes” rather than make a more complex point about that inequality and why it exists.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Odd aesthetic details are all in service of the compelling atmosphere.</p></div><p>Despite taking a lot of its elements from other places, the developers have added a lot of their own unique details. We’ve seen body swapping in cyberpunk fiction before, but I don’t think I’ve seen a system that outright says how many disadvantages that can have if you get a body that was addicted to drugs or has allergies. I also love how James’ apartment building is such a shithole that he has to summon a shared bathroom to use, which leads to a hilarious interaction with a neighbor who was still bathing. </p><p>There are also tiny aesthetic details that don’t make much sense, like how many locks require you to input a numbered code with a rotary dial. Why is a world in the 24th century not utilizing computers more? How is James able to find a drive-in theater that plays nearly 400-year-old black and white movies? These odd tidbits are all in service of the compelling atmosphere, and it’s super easy to accept them when you can tell the Critical Hit Games is having a lot of fun just putting anachronisms together in new ways.</p><p>The setting and world-building pieces pay homage to the 1950s and film noir, but that doesn’t mean it’s held on a pedestal. Many of James’ monologues and musings about the grimy lives of others, the oppressive system they all live under, and the violence he has to face are overtly poetic and corny, and sometimes he or other characters — especially his partner, Sara — call him out on it. Sara is a great foil for James; they have compelling platonic chemistry, with her talking him through the case and his thoughts through a receiver in his ear, and he does the same for her. </p><p>With multiple dialogue paths to choose from in most conversations, you can either take a serious route during your investigation or go for the stupid answer – that could be listening to your corrupt police chief boss or ignoring him and stealing evidence. I played my first run straight, and while not every choice was “morally” correct, the darker tone felt genuine to James. I leaned into the silly options on my second playthrough and it created hilarious moments, like how James is afraid of the light from his UV detection tool because they cause cancer. He’s the kind of guy who sits on neon signs outside his apartment on the 500th story of a building, drinking or smoking (do not play this game if you’re afraid of heights) as a melodramatic loner, and Nobody Wants to Die takes every opportunity to make fun of him for that.</p><p>This combination of new and old creates a pulpy mix of scenes that can swing wildly between depressive retrospection, outright tragedy, and self-aware nonsense, and it all somehow never feels out of place. In fact, Nobody Wants to Die’s dedication to that tonal dissonance is largely what lets it stand out despite its very obvious homages.</p><h2>Nobody Wants to Hold Your Hand</h2><p>While Nobody Wants to Die wants you to play out a neo-noir detective fantasy, there are some limits — namely in how it lets you solve cases, which isn’t much at all. Most of the actions you’ll take outside of the branching dialogue boil down to the detective work itself, which involves surveying a crime scene, gathering evidence, using futuristic tech to reconstruct gruesome, gory murders so they play out in front of your eyes, and then putting it all together with an evidence board. </p><p>How all the gadgets work is a bit confusing at first, but by the end of the first case, you fall into a routine. Use the Reconstructor to reconstruct events, fast forward or rewind through the three-dimensional footage to find new evidence or leads you want to pursue, analyze those pieces, and pull out your supplementary UV light and X-Ray to dig a little deeper. All of the data you gather will then be presented on the evidence board, where you can draw conclusions through a little activity where you’ll similarly be told outright if you’re guessing right or wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It seems simple enough, and it is, especially because there are very few instances where you go about it on your own. You’ll usually get a prompt or a piece of dialogue that tells you exactly what to do, which tool to use, and how to think. You’re very much dragged through the story and forced to watch it play out instead of doing your own detective work, which removes any sense of accomplishment. There isn’t a time limit, nor is there fear you’ll miss an important clue. It can also be annoying when the figures moving throughout your reconstructions get in the way of your tools, blocking your view and causing you to make frivolous mistakes as you complete a series of mouse clicks to activate them. </p><p>The choice to remove all your agency during these investigation phases does at least allow you to experience the story more closely, since you don’t have to focus on other areas, like actually solving a case yourself. That’s especially true in how certain events impact each other to create more conversation options, but the rigid structure does also lessen the impact of your investigation quite a bit. </p><p>Thankfully, the dialogue system is worth paying attention to. It’s not the most robust I’ve seen, but there’s enough choice that you feel like you have a semblance of control over James and his actions while talking. His core personality never changes, but you can decide whether he answers Sara honestly about evidence he chose to steal from a crime scene, drink and drive, comply with the police, or even shoot somebody. How impactful your choices are varies, and there are multiple endings despite the story always arriving at the same tense confrontation, but Nobody Wants to Die understands that it’s about the journey. The final payoff is also satisfyingly dark, letting you ruminate on your choices – sometimes to the point of absolute despair. </p><h2>Nobody Wants You to Save Your Game</h2><p>If you’re invested enough to see all the different outcomes, you can start again on a new save file, but Critical Hit Games didn’t make it easy to run through a second time. While not giving you the option to manually save is a great way to make you sit and think about the consequence of each choice, it does make it quite difficult to see everything. There isn’t any new game plus or chapter select after your first playthrough, either. If you want to fast forward through long conversations, you only have the option to spam a skip button, which you have to click for each line of dialogue, and you can’t skip cutscenes at all. So if you want to experience the different endings, you’ll pretty much just have to play through the entire campaign again.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Best choice-driven narrative games</h3><p>Like the ability to make choices in how your character interacts with the game world? These games can help with that.</p></div><p>Granted, Nobody Wants to Die is only five or six hours long, and depending on the ending you get, there’s plenty of motivation to hop back in. I got a particularly bad ending that, to me, felt like the worst possible outcome for the story, so I of course wanted to see if I could get <em>anything</em> else — maybe something that didn’t make me feel dead inside (pun intended). Starting from scratch wasn’t a total slog, since I made new choices that unlocked conversations or paid off differently down the line. Still, I eventually looked up a compilation of all the endings, and while there are certainly happier ones than the initial one I got, none of them are “perfect.” James’ story is about a past that slowly emerges to haunt him, and your player skills aren’t going to stop his bittersweet conclusion. </p><p>The decision to not include these replayability features is an interesting one, as many branching narrative games want you to feel the weight of your choices but also give you the opportunity to change them. I have to give the developers credit on making such an audacious move, but does it make Nobody Wants to Die more “enjoyable,” whatever that vague term means? I’m not sure. Maybe I would feel differently if I got the “best” ending on my first try, but it feels like there should be an option to help speed up additional playthroughs after the first at the very least. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today Humble Games, publisher of indie hits like <em>Signalis</em>, <em>Wizard of Legend</em>, and <em>Temtem</em>, informed employees of layoffs that will impact the whole company, leaving its staff of 36 jobless.</p><p>Laid-off workers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to LinkedIn</a> to relay what management told them in a morning meeting, which Aftermath has obtained a recording of. In the meeting, Steve Horowitz, president of parent company Ziff Davis’ technology and shopping division, pointed to long delays and rising costs as pervasive issues faced by Humble Games. He went on to say that Ziff had attempted to sell Humble Games twice, but that “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome."&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he explained, employees are being let go, and remaining projects will be carried over the finish line by a third-party company called The Powell Group.&nbsp;</p><p>"We continue to see the cost rise, delays continue, and during the sale process or our attempt to sell over the past couple of months, we've seen an additional millions increase in development expenses coupled with even longer delays in bringing titles to market,” Horowitz told employees. “Given all this, we've made a very tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games with the goal of providing the best cost-effective way to make sure that the games see the market, our existing slate sees market, and supporting the developers that are associated with it. As such, we're gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog. As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesperson for Humble Games told Aftermath that this is a restructuring, not a closure, mirroring <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humble Games’ statement on the matter on Twitter</a>. However, considering that all employees are being laid off and a third-party company is taking over their duties, what remains will be Humble Games in name only.&nbsp;</p><p>Former employees are incensed by what they perceive to be damage control tactics on Ziff Davis’ part.</p><p>"Ziff is trying to spread the idea that it's a restructuring to save face, but that's a lie," one former Humble Games employee, who was granted anonymity to avoid potentially voiding a severance agreement, told Aftermath. "No one from HG survived the layoffs, nor will they have anything to do with game launches moving forward."</p><p>Chris Radley, a former Humble Games creative lead who left the company at the end of 2022, spelled things out even more clearly <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>"Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left," Radley wrote. "Do not believe this tailored message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was once again a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative, and it's so disrespectful."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Humble Games was a publisher spun off from Humble Bundle, a charity-centric storefront that was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bundle-has-been-acquired-by-media-giant-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by IGN in 2017</a> and which has not been impacted by today’s cuts. More recently, IGN purchased the Gamer Network of sites – which includes Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, GamesIndustry.biz, and VG247 – for an undisclosed sum, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate layoffs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dicebreaker-layoffs-board-games-website-ign-gamer-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gutting of Dicebreaker</a>, a beloved board game site. Former Humble Games employees to whom Aftermath spoke believe that these cuts are less tied up in that side of the business and more the end result of a media company failing to understand how to run a video game publisher.</p><p>"The business models were just incompatible with each other,” a former Humble Games employee told Aftermath. “Ziff is very good at owning a lot of media and increasing revenue in advertising, and Humble Games publishing was just not something that agreed with their business model. They needed money. They needed it now. They wanted to see an immediate increase in revenue after investing cash into a business, and unfortunately that's just not how games works."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another former Humble Games employee told Aftermath: “Ziff Davis does not understand the world of game development – and the principle that when you invest money, a game is not released in six months but takes time to be done – and were starting to not like this when they understood its workings, so with their stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development.”</p><p>Former employees were surprised by Ziff’s decision to lay everybody off, with some hoping today’s meeting would instead be about a sale. That said, there were signs that trouble was afoot: Late last year, Humble Games was <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/humble-games-layoffs-november-2023?utm_source=reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit with layoffs</a>, and former employees say that this year saw the company fail to sign any projects for 2026 or 2027, a conspicuous gap in the calendar considering the kind of lead time game releases require.</p><p>Former employees are feeling crushed by this latest turn of events, a painfully jarring conclusion to a project they took immense pride in despite the ups and downs.</p><p>"We were very charity-oriented. Humble Bundle itself raised a quarter of a billion dollars for charity, and I know a portion of that was due to Humble Games,” said one former employee. "We looked for people who didn't just want to be in games, who didn't just want to be in some random indie games publisher, but people that very much exemplified those values.”</p><p>“Everyone cared for each other, taking on work of their colleagues to help when needed, always taking into consideration what could hurt or impact their colleagues and trying to ease it before it even happened,” said another former employee. “And this was reflected back to the way we worked with the indie devs, providing honest feedback without imposing creative changes, respecting and trusting in their game visions, not going by the letter of the contract when it came to [approving] milestones, as everyone knows how game devs work and how sometimes things takes a bit longer before becoming good. … This was truly a unique publisher with an amazing cast of people, and I am not sure that a similar publishing structure exists.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has formally revoked the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> World Championship 2024 winning team's title after racist messages sent by several of its members surfaced online.
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was held in April, with six teams competing for the crown. North American team Jackpot was eventually named the winner, but the four-person group became embroiled in controversy this June, after Discord and social media chats showing some of its members engaging in racist behaviour began <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800558539934773269">circulating on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, roughly six weeks later, Nintendo has officially rescinded Jackpot's winning title, albeit without explicitly specifying the reason behind its decision.

<p>
"It has come to our attention," the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887">wrote on social media</a>, "that certain members of team Jackpot, the team that recently won the Splatoon 3 World Championship, acted in a manner that is not in line with our Community Guidelines while playing the Splatoon 3 game. As a result, team Jackpot's win will be considered vacated, and the team will not receive trophies associated with the event."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo additionally notes the Splashtag banner currently commemorating Jackpot's win in Splatoon 3 will be "adjusted" in a future update. "Nintendo cares deeply about our player and our community," it adds, "and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously."
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">event was cancelled</a> to "ensure the safety of our customers" after Nintendo received a message threatening to "kill the people at the venue".
</p>
<p>
In April, a 27-year-old man was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">charged</a> with sending the message - one of 39 death threats he's said to have sent to Nintendo via the company's online inquiry form.

According to <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1815817188286009617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon's Nicole Carpenter</a>, the layoffs affect 36 workers. <em>[Disclosure: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis. Charity bundle platform Humble Bundle remains a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment.]</em></p><p>The announcement was part of a statement from Humble Games, which was published on Linkedin in the wake of <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several workers confirming their layoffs on social media</a>. The statement emphasized "the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects" while saying that the restructuring does not impact Humble Bundle.</p><blockquote>In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p><p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority.

It is deeply appreciated.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reached separately for comment, a Ziff Davis representative shared the statement posted above and said that the company is "not shutting down but is undergoing restructuring," and that "all past and ongoing projects and upcoming releases are not affected and will continue to be supported and published by Humble Games." The representative said they could not comment on the number of staff affected or remaining. <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aftermath</a> has since reported that all employees have been laid off and that work will be completed by a third-party company.</p><p>Humble Games is an indie publishing label with a portfolio including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus, Signalis and Stray Gods.

It was later discovered that Crowdstrike, a large cybersecurity company, had pushed out an update that was borked and broke everything for hours. And as is common on the internet these days, people began joking about it and making up stories, some of which went viral. For example, a lot of people still think the Las Vegas Sphere crashed during the Crowdstrike event.

In the article, it’s mentioned that these programs look like they were designed in Windows 95. </p><p>Since then, people have been spouting off the incorrect notion that Southwest is using Windows 95, which was then backed up by a viral tweet and some outlets running with the story. </p><p>But there appears to be no evidence that Southwest is actually still using Windows 3.1. Sure, the software they are using to plan flights and manage their employees looks old and has apparently been around since 2007 or so. That’s true, and scary. But no, Southwest didn’t avoid the Windows Crash because they use an operating system from 1992. As for why Southwest mostly avoided the chaos of July 19?

However, after racist messages sent by the team surfaced in the months following the event, Nintendo has now announced that it will invalidate the team's win and remove their likenesses from the game.</p><p>Today, in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, Nintendo Versus announced that Jackpot's win would be vacated and the team would not receive trophies due to its violations of the company's community guidelines.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update on the 2024 Splatoon 3 World Championship: <a href="https://t.co/pYUMQzmj7S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pYUMQzmj7S</a></p>— Nintendo Versus (@NintendoVS) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Nintendo also pledged to adjust a Splashtag (or in-game profile banner) it had added to the game to commemorate Jackpot's win. The adjustment will presumably remove the team's characters from the banner and replace them with default characters.</p><p>Phantom Thief of the Heart, the Japanese team that played against Jackpot in the final, was not retroactively granted the win after the announcement, leaving the World Championship with no official winner. </p><p>"Nintendo cares deeply about our players and our community, and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously," the post reads.</p><p>Nintendo's move comes after the team's racist messages circulated online in early June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-hamm-is-starring-in-and-co-producing-dungeons-dragons-thriller-podcast-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> podcast is in production. It is not an actual play like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dimension20</em></a>, nor is it one discussing lore and game mechanics. It is called <em>Dungeon Masters</em>, a scripted drama based around an infamous event of the fantasy tabletop RPG. It already has a star and a co-producer: the Emmy-winning actor Jon Hamm.</p>

<p>According to an exclusive report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/jon-hamm-star-podcast-series-dungeon-masters-dragons-1236018719/">Deadline</a>, Hamm has been set to star and executive produce the Dungeon Masters podcast. Hamm is a prolific talent in both film and TV. His roles include Edgar Wright's <em>Baby Driver</em>, and the Amazon Video adaptation of <em>Good Omens</em>. His most iconic role by far is as ad executive Don Draper in the historical drama, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/"><em>Mad Men</em></a>.</p>

Dear dives into the behind-the-curtain world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> while investigating the disappearance of Michigan State student Dallas Egbert. Egbert supposedly disappeared in the school's steam tunnels while enacting D&amp;D in real-life.</p>
<p>Jon Hamm isn't the only star power attached to <em>Dungeon Masters</em>. Wil Wheaton has been attached as the voice of <em>D&amp;D</em> co-creator Gary Gygax. Additional names include Felicia Day, Emily Axford, and Anjali Bhimani.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> may recall this infamous case. It became fertile ground for the Satanic Panic, an era of moral outrage for the fantasy TTRPG in the 1980s. As the name implies, it lead to various activist groups claiming the game was promoting the practice of magic and satanism.</p>

The book, which was largely based on the Egbert case, depicts a sensationalist story of a group of college students who play a fantasy TTRPG. It ends with one of the leads completely losing their grip on reality. It received a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084314/">film adaptation</a> in 1982 starring Tom Hanks.</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Masters</em> is the result of one journalist's research into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was created, written, and directed by David Kushner, author of several game-related works like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Dungeon-Master-Gygax-Creation/dp/1568585594" rel="sponsored"><em>Rise of the Dungeon Master: Gary Gygax and the Creation of D&amp;D</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jacked-Outlaw-Story-Grand-Theft/dp/1455130338" rel="sponsored"><em>Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto</em></a>.</p>
<p>Kushner is producing the show alongside Hamm, QCode and Temple Hill Entertainment. The podcast will debut on August 12.</p>

            <p>Humble Games, the publishing division of digital storefront Humble Bundle, says it has "made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations" amid reports it has laid off all staff, but insists it is "not shutting down".
</p>
<p>
Humble Games was formed in 2017, and has gone on to publish a significant number of acclaimed titles, including Stray Gods, Signalis, Slay the Spire, A Hat in Time, and Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021, Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, however, several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs at the company. "At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">wrote</a> in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down".
</p>
<p>
"Another year, another lay off!," Humble Bundle senior QA Emilee Kieffer added in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">separate post</a>. "Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games."
</p>
<p>
In response to those initial claims, a Humble Games spokesperson has now confirmed "restructuring" at the company, but insists it is "not shutting down" and that its upcoming releases - which includes Monaco 2 and Wizard of Legend 2 - won't be affected. The spokesperson added they "cannot currently comment on staffing numbers at this time" when asked how many employees had been impacted by layoffs. Today's news follows an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-latest-to-announce-layoffs">unspecified number of job cuts</a> at Humble Games last November.
</p>
<p>
"In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations," the company wrote in a statement provided to Eurogamer. "This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle."
</p>
<p>
"We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathise with everyone affected," it continued. "Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible."
</p>
<p>
"Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority," Humble Games concluded in its statement. "We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated."
</p>
<p>
Humble Bundle, alongside Humble Games, was purchased by Ziff Davis in October 2017 and has operated under subsidiary IGN Entertainment since then. Eurogamer and its sister sites, including Rock Paper Shotgun and GamesIndustry.biz, have been part of IGN Entertainment since May, when Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">acquired Gamer Network</a> from former owner Reedpop.
</p>
<p>
2024 continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people having lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023.

The Dragon engine, which powers most of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s games since <em>Yakuza 6</em>, is defined by smoothness and seamlessness. Running animations in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Infinite Wealth</em></a></span><em> </em>look and feel fluid, but in <em>Yakuza 0 </em>they are stiff and a little janky. If Ichiban’s movement in the latest games could be defined as <em>flowing</em>, I’d reckon that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kiryu</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279">Majima</a></span>’s movement in <em>0 </em>could be called <em>jagged</em>.<br></p><p>And yet I can’t get enough of it.</p><p>I <em>love </em>the friction in every second of <em>Yakuza 0 </em>so far, and it goes beyond the aforementioned jank. It is great to be able to save your game anywhere in the later titles, but I love the feeling of having to walk my ass over to a phone booth in order to save in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. It leads me on so many adventures, and I’ve encountered so many characters and substories already just by trying to find a save point. Then I get strung along on a fun little journey with some screwball plot and quirky characters that usually ends in a fun but ridiculous fight.</p><p>Some of these encounters haven’t gone in my favor! I was hesitant to jump into the earlier <em>Like a Dragon </em>games largely due to the fact that I didn’t really enjoy <em>Judgment</em>’s brawler gameplay, and I’m glad to report that I’m pretty bad at <em>Yakuza 0</em>, as I expected. And after barely escaping some street scrap, I found that Kiryu couldn’t sprint, let alone walk upright. Instead, he limped along in whatever direction I prodded him, and slowly but surely, we made it to a nearby fast-food joint where Kiryu could eat and recuperate his health. He walked out of that place like a new man. He just like me.</p><p>In both instances, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>makes the friction work for itself. It is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394">game built upon everyday hurdles</a></span>, and clearing them is not only conducive to how it doles out stories, but allows for moments that make the character feel tangible, and incentivizes me to dig into <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s features. And that isn’t all of it! You get winded after sprinting for too long, meaning you can’t just run from every fight, which is good because you need the money that literally files out of enemies whose faces you maim in order to level up and buy anything. On its surface, these mechanics seem oddly limiting, but it only takes a few hours to learn that these are master strokes from developers executing at a high level. These blemishes are actually masterfully disguised designs.</p><p>These elements are absent in later games, which admittedly have made up for some of these sacrifices with other qualities that similarly deepen the environments and the characters, though I can’t say it entirely works for me. For example, there are no longer loading screens separating indoor and outdoor environments, thanks to the Dragon engine’s ability to render both seamlessly. This does make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988">Kamurocho feel like more than just set dressing</a></span>, and suggests a literal interiority that goes a long way toward player immersion. <em>Infinite Wealth </em>encourages players to try out combinations of food and drinks at various restaurants in order to apply greater buffs and unlock dialogues between multiple party members around the dinner table. However, the former feels more like a technical showcase than anything, and the latter feels like a largely skippable detour. They only serve you if you look for something deeper within them.</p><p>By contrast, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>feels like it’s intentionally shuttling me from diverse experience to experience, and has been greater for it. Everywhere I look, there’s a subtly deep mechanic or feature or quirk of animation and art that gives <em>Yakuza 0 </em>a texture that’s absent from the more sanitized games that have come after it. I love how fluid <em>Infinite Wealth </em>feels, but I’d love it even more if future <em>Like a Dragon </em>games could find a place for that friction.</p><p>It’s not like the change in engine has robbed the series of a voice and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387">personality</a></span>, or even the ability to do things like this. <em>Yakuza 6 </em>largely brought many of these quirks forward, and Kiryu would not only get gassed after running for a long while, but he’d even trip over smaller elements of the world. You could get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot in a fight</a></span>, sending Kiryu hurtling over a railing and tumbling into water, where he’d immediately drown. In <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which transformed the series into a turn-based RPG, your turn could be interrupted by enemies in your path. These might be points of frustration to some, but they are also cool touches that personify a game, and lead to little stories we get to tell ourselves or tuck away to remember! Nowadays, any hurdle in a modern <em>Like a Dragon </em>game is either cleared by an auto-mount mechanic or just acts as an invisible wall you need to get around. It’s <em>too </em>clean.</p><p>The difference is pronounced enough that it now retroactively feels like there’s this dissonance between the hard-hitting stories of the later <em>Like a Dragon </em>games and their actual feeling. Like it’s talking its talk, but also walking a distinctly different walk, and every subsequent step continues to stray a bit further from where we began. In <em>Yakuza 0</em>, by contrast, these elements are considerably more in sync.</p><p>I’m not suggesting RGG take steps backwards. I appreciate the ways in which the series <em>has </em>grown, but I think I’d like it a bit more if the series felt more intentional, and not like it’s cast off some past shell for something new and glossy. I think if they just rough up the next <em>Like a Dragon </em>game a bit more, it’ll get back to that grime and that texture that’s really helping me appreciate <em>Yakuza 0 </em>these days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ava Kris Tyson has announced she will be leaving the Mr Beast team following a recent slew of allegations pertaining to grooming an inappropriate behavior.</p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, of which Ava has recently deleted of her past posts, she said, “I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior or comments if it hurt or offended anyone. It was not my intent. Seeing recent events we’ve mutually decided it’s best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health.”</p>



<p>In the past couple of days, Aca Kris Tyson has faced numerous allegations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ava-kris-tyson-predator-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grooming and sending inappropriate sexual messages to a minor</a>.</p>



<p>Mr Beast, or anyone from his team, has yet to officially comment on the allegations and Ava Kris Tyson’s departure from the team.</p>



<p>Countless streamers, content creators, and other personalities have since voiced their opinions on the situation. Popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/pokimanelol/status/1815787489778655664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokimane said</a>, “I don’t know all the details regarding the ava situation but i wanna make it clear: any inappropriate behavior towards minors is unacceptable, regardless of who you are.”</p>



<p>As the days continue, more and more accusations and allegations continue to be released about Ava Kris Tyson. However, one of the original accusations was that Ava Kris Tyson was sending inappropriate messages to a 13-year-old. Since then, though, that person has said that these accusations are “massive lies and twisting the truth.”</p>

While it used to be revenue from sales of boxed copies at GameStop and Walmart, it’s now overwhelmingly from sales of digital downloads on console storefronts. Publishers like Electronic Arts don’t even make most of their money from game sales at all, but rather from “recurring revenue,” AKA microtransactions in online multiplayer and free-to-play games like <em>Madden</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>“Back then before the PlayStation 4 was released, you’d be lucky to get five to 10 percent of digital sales for a AAA game,” Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an interview. “Today, depending on the title, you know, it can be as high as 80 percent but it could also be as low as 40 percent.” He noted that while the average breakdowns overwhelmingly favor digital downloads (with platforms like PlayStation reporting annual digital revenue splits over 70 percent), it can still vary a lot on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its annual report this year</a></span>, Capcom revealed that roughly 89 percent of the games it sells are digital copies. It expects that number to reach close to 94 percent in 2024. The report also emphasized how much more profitable these sales are. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, a new $50 Capcom game with no physical version, exemplifies that move.

The statement echoed a view expressed by Ubisoft SVP Chris Early last year. “Some people will always want to own the physical disk,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/wy4gKUmOdRRoO5Uvlr8CA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/wy4gKUmOdRRoO5Uvlr8CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a Q&amp;A</a></span> on the French publisher’s Activision Blizzard cloud gaming deal. “I just don’t think it’s going away. Do I think physical sales might get lower over time? Sure, but will it ever completely go away? I don’t think so.”<br></p><p>Aggregate data can sometimes obscure small but substantial wrinkles in popular trends. While it’s true that physical games have become a niche market in the broader gaming landscape, a shift accelerated by the pandemic, Early also pointed out that even a small slice of a big pie can mean a lot of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a<em> GamesIndustry.biz</em> infographic</a></span> using Newzoo data, only 17 percent of console gaming revenue in 2023 was from boxed games, but that still came out to $9.5 billion.

So, yes, it’s a small part, but it’s not tiny by any means.”</p><h2 id="h65507"><a id=""></a>Games like <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>buck digital trends</h2><p>The market for physical copies of some first-party games, for example, remains surprisingly strong.

Nintendo still reports that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.shacknews.com/article/139787/nintendo-ntdoy-fy-2024-digital-sales&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/139787/nintendo-ntdoy-fy-2024-digital-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roughly half of its software revenue</a></span> comes from physical releases vs. digital spending, which includes digital-only games and add-on content. But the difference is even more stark when you compare breakdowns of physical sales to digital sales for games that have retail copies. Based on his estimates, Switch owners bought physical copies over digital 60 percent of the time in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>“When it comes to digital sales as a whole it’s absolutely massive,” Ahmad said more generally. “But if we look at just the physical versus digital split for games that are released physically, then yes, it’s lower than that 70 percent number and two, it definitely skews higher for AAA and first-party games, especially during the holiday season, where gifting is a notable part of it.”</p><p>And even as some big games like<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and <em>Alan Wake II</em> have initially skipped physical copies at launch, smaller games and indie releases that were previously digital-only are partnering with companies like Limited Run Games to get physical editions printed and into the hands of their hardcore fans. “I think there’s always going to be a demand for physical media,” Limited Run CEO Josh Fairhurst told<em> Kotaku</em> in a recent interview. “We see that with music, things were starting to feel like it was going to go all digital, and then vinyl kind of exploded, because people were starting to see kind of the downsides of digital purchasing not actually owning the music.”</p><p>He said the audience for that is definitely the biggest on Switch and smallest on Xbox, estimating that for every Xbox version of a physical game Limited Run sells, two are purchased on PlayStation and 10 are bought on Nintendo’s platform. In addition to the physical connection fans feel to the products going back to the NES and PS1 days, he thinks fears about the lack of digital preservation also drive physical collecting.</p><p>“I think that’s kind of going to happen more and more as time marches on and more services end up shutting down for whatever reason, because there’s always going to be something newer, bigger, better coming out that will eventually out mode, whatever the current popular model of distribution is,” Fairhurst said. “I think people are going to get frustrated when they see their digital purchases evaporate.”</p><p>That’s not necessarily the case as much for Xbox, where a majority of console sales this generation have already been for the disc-less Series S and millions are subscribed to the Netflix-style rental service Game Pass. Fans now routinely share photos online of almost all-digital Xbox sections at stores like Target and Best Buy where cards with download codes have replaced plastic game cases. Big first-party releases like <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> have skipped physical editions, and earlier this year a number of physical editions of small games by third-party publishers appeared to be canceled. Meanwhile, leaked plans pointed to Microsoft at one point working on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060">discless mid-gen refresh for the Series X</a></span>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told <em>Game File</em> the company wasn’t planning to abandon physical media. “I will say our strategy does not hinge on people moving all-digital,” he said. “And getting rid of physical, that’s not a strategic thing for us.” But analysts all think Xbox will be the first console to ditch discs entirely. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted earlier this year</a></span> that he expected Microsoft to go all-digital soon, with Sony following the one after that, and Nintendo having at least two more hardware generations with physical media.</p><p>“Physical, as long as there’s disk drives on the console, is never going to go fully away, there’ll always be demand for it, as long as it’s part of the console package,” Ahmad said. “But if, for example, Xbox decides to exclude a disc drive next generation, like we saw with the all digital Series X, they’re unlikely to see a negative material impact on earnings given how niche physical sales are on the platform today.”</p><p>And even when companies continue to support physical formats, the advantages of them are continuing to erode. Where discs and cartridges used to be plug-and-play, they now need to install on the console and often require massive day-one updates. It might be weeks or months before important bugs are fixed or highly requested gameplay features get added in post-launch patches. “With that in mind, a lot of people will say ‘I’ll just get the digital version’,” Ahmad said. “It’s just the same thing, but more convenient.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
