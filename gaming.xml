			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's high price raised quite a few eyebrows when it was revealed at the end of yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">technical presentation</a>, but players may need to look at things differently to understand the system's pricing.</p>
<p>Following the system's reveal, former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra commented on the console's price, suggesting to see things from a different point of view. Like any mid-generation hardware refresh, the PS5 Pro is about existing users upgrading. As such, when the teams evaluate the cost, they don't want to lose money on each console to avoid putting pressure on other parts of the business while maximizing value to players. As such, the PlayStation 5 Pro pricing took into account the fact that users upgrading will trade in their base models to cover some of the upgrading costs. At the end of the day, the console is a low volume product that also allows Sony to say that they have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think of this a bit differently. Pro models, or any in-generation upgrade, is about existing users upgrading. So when teams evaluate the cost - they don't want to lose money on each console as that puts pressure on other parts of the business. And they think about how they can…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good news is no one has to buy it. It's a low volume product and I always think it's nice to say you have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<p>For many, existing PS5 is fine and people should be happy.</p>
<p>Kind of like the S, it's fine. Some don't need the X. I…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833579323972112843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The high price, however, isn't going to be a major issue for the PlayStation 5 Pro, as analysts at Ampere Analysis, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/analyst-expects-ps5-pro-to-sell-at-ps4-pro-levels-despite-relatively-high-price/">VGC</a>, expect the system to sell as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro did. In its launch window, analysts expect around 1.3 million units sold and around 13 million units by 2029. The high price is going to soften demand for the system, but it is less of a problem for PlayStation enthusiasts, according to Ampere Analysis research director for games Piers Harding-Rolls, a statement that falls in line with the statements from Mike Ybarra reported above.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7th worldwide for $699.99 / £699.99 / €799.99.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-114-final-boss-nerf</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-1-14-nerfs-the-final-boss.977817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-114-final-boss-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and if you're struggling with the DLC's final boss, then this update is very much for you.</p>
<p>The main changes in this update relate to&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final story encounter, which is also arguably the toughest encounter in the entire game, if not in the series as a whole to date.</p>
<p>We're not going to spoil the identity of the final boss here, but suffice it to say that the update decreases the boss' damage, as well as the stamina damage some of its attacks do. You'll also notice the final boss has decreased range on some of its "non-weapon-based attacks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=-aRept6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=Rc_pDbfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final boss, but if it was, you'd be finding it a bit easier than before.</figcaption></figure><p>The boss' "attack pattern" at the outset of the fight has also been changed, along with the "visibility of some attack effects", so if you've been struggling to see why you're dying over and over again, that struggle should be just a bit more bearable now.</p>
<p>This being an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>update, you'll also find lots of miscellaneous bug fixes and balance changes, some of which pertain exclusively to PvP play. It's a good idea to read up on those if you're in the business of exterminating your fellow Tarnished.</p>
<p>If you want to see everything that's new in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update 1.14, then <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>. It's not a massive update, but there are still a fair few tweaks and fixes to read up on, including one that might help you with the PS5 version's unstable frame rate.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first (and probably only) DLC expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">phenomenally popular</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC sees the player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">exploring the Land of Shadow</a> in order to follow in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean who's mentioned in the base game but never actually encountered. It adds new bosses, enemies, and areas to explore, plus new weapons and more.</p>
<p>Like the base game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular; it picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">five million sales in less than a week</a>, and it was also met with a very strong critical reception indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">not least from us</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. You will, of course, need a copy of the base game to play it.</p>

<p>According to a new document, Pocket Pair might announce Palworld’s arrival on PS5 at the Tokyo Game Show 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per Gematsu’s post on X, the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) has released a <a href="https://t.co/X0XnPvu7fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">document</a> with a list of games for the Tokyo Game Show 2024. This list consists of all the developers who will attend the event, along with their games and platforms. According to the document, Pocket Pair’s Palworld has marked PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam as the target platforms. However, it is worth noting that this list isn’t definitive.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pocket Pair <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in July 2024 that they will partner with Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. This partnership, however, did not include game licenses. If the information in the latest CESA document is accurate, then maybe Pocket Pair has also worked out a deal with Sony to bring Palworld to PS5. We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-palworld">What is Palworld?</h2>



<p>Palworld is an open-world survival crafting game that features mysterious creatures called Pals. These Pals can fight against enemies, build outposts, farm resources, and work in factories. The game was released in early access on January 24 and was able to bring more than 25 million players within the first month of release. The title also recently received a significant update, introducing a new island, Sakurajima, along with a new collection of Pals, enemies and items.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the PS5 Pro will cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-ps5-pro-will-cost-200-more-than-base-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 more than the base console</a>. Also, Ubisoft has announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld coming to PS5? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

But now we have a clear idea of just how popular Space Marine 2 is across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in addition to PC.</p><p>That two million players figure will no doubt include early access players (Space Marine 2’s effective release date was September 5 for those who pre-ordered any of the special editions), but it’s certainly enough to make Space Marine 2 the most-played Warhammer 40,000 or Warhammer video game at launch of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While Space Marine 2 is going down well with fans (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">IGN’s Space Marine 2 review</a> returned an 8/10), there are a number of notable issues. Fans have expressed shock that the game launched without ultrawide support, for example, given it’s a standard feature for video games these days. As a result, ultrawide resolutions are letterboxed, with forced black bars.</p><p>Similarly shocking, there is no function to allow private PvE lobbies at launch. This means you’ll have no choice but to open yourself up to the whims of matchmaking as you play the endgame Operations mode.</p><p>Thankfully, both ultrawide support and private PvE lobbies are coming to Space Marine 2 as part of its first patch, Focus confirmed in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4599952112536595143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game’s Steam page</a> celebrating the launch. The first patch, due out “soon”, will also add a sparring area to the Battle Barge, Space Marine 2’s player hub spaceship.</p><p>“Please believe us when we say we're reading all of your feedback with great attention,” Focus said. “It takes time because of the amount of messages we have to deal with, obviously. But we see and hear you.</p><p>“A first patch will arrive soon enough! We are also completely aware of the different bugs you've been encountering. We're working hard to fix them." It will include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ultra Wide Support</li><li>Private PVE lobbies</li><li>Sparring area</li></ul><p>Earlier this week, Focus said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-first-update-detailed">Space Marine 2’s first update would make server improvements and crash fixes</a>. The server problems in particular, and the dreaded “joining server bug,” have made co-op play difficult for some players, and even caused lost progression and rewards.</p><p>IGN has reported on the upcoming addition of class matching for co-op, after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together"><u>players found themselves locked in a class standoff ahead of Operations mode missions</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> producer Noriaki Okamura has stated the development team would "rather come down on the side of 'too faithful'" than make big changes compared to the original game.</p>
<p>During previews for the Snake Eater remake, a frequent criticism was the game felt outdated compared to modern stealth games and too few changes were made compared to the PS2 original.</p>
<p>However, in a new "Production Hotline" video, Okamura explained the thought process behind maintaining the original vision of the game.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - UE5 Remake vs Original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmPyKTtaxhk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the original game, the world is broken up into smaller areas but your actions in one area don't impact another - resetting your alert status when spotted by guards, for instance. This remains the same in the remake.</p>
<p>Okamura understands the criticism and said it was the development team's "most hotly debated issue", but "that's just how the game was designed".</p>
<p>"The rhythm and the shifting pace of gameplay flows from that choice," he continued. "If we had done anything to change that overarching design, it would have changed the game entirely. And given what we were setting out to do, we questioned whether that really fit with the vision for this project.</p>
<p>"So we decided that we'd rather come down on the side of 'too faithful', and that we'd rather maintain the original design of MGS3: SE instead of try and rework everything."</p>
<p>Despite this faithfulness to the original, the Delta remake won't include the line "A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> Game" and instead the opening credits will read "Based on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3".</p>
<p>This likely won't come as a surprise, considering Kojima has had no input on this remake after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">his acrimonious split from Konami</a>, but it's a notable change from the original.</p>

<p>In the same video, Okamura acknowledged the existence of the expected Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2, but asked fans to "give us time" before announcing further news.</p>
<p>In a series of fan questions, Okamura was asked about what games would be in the collection and when it would be released. However, the "rough launch" for the first collection means Konami does not want to repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>"Of course, we called the first one Vol. 1, so we are making a Vol. 2, that much is for sure," said Okamura. "We're also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all the issues, so we're going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time."</p>
<p>After Metal Gear Solids 1-3 were included in the first collection, it's expected the second volume will continue Snake's story with Metal Gear Solid 4, especially as that game remains solely on PS3.</p>
<p>"You can probably connect the dots," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stay-tuned-for-metal-gear-solid-4-in-master-collection-vol-2-says-konami">said Okamura previously on the inclusion of Metal Gear Solid 4</a>.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's own preview of the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-14/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing significant changes to the final boss of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.14 makes plenty of adjustments for the final boss battle of the expansion, changing the attack pattern at the beginning of the battle, adjusting some attacks, and decreasing their health and stamina damage. The range of some non-weapon-based attacks was also reduced, while the visibility of some attack effects has been improved. The visibility changes, in particular, are extremely welcome, as I have found one of the biggest issues in this boss battle, other than the massive range of most attacks, is the visual clutter that makes it hard to understand what's going on.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring patch also includes the usual slew of PvP and general balance changes and bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite the high challenge level, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is a worthy addition to the experience and one of the best expansions FromSoftware has put out to date. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game</em>.</p>

            <p>If there's one thing I've heard from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> modders when I've asked for their thoughts on the future of Minecraft, it's some variation on "fewer updates, please". This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates. </p><!--more-->
<p>I've heard Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.2 described as a "golden" period, simply because there was almost a year between it and the next major update. Picture these interludes as sustained magma leaks on the chilly ocean floor, creating a pocket of warmth in which various species of uncommonly inventive organism can dwell and prosper and make little houses out of coral. But then, the magma supply runs out, and the tinkersome critters must hastily relocate to the next thermal oasis.</p>
<p>Repeatedly updating a successful mod is a full-time job which potentially steals time away from other projects. As such, I'm curious to know what Minecraft's modders think of Mojang's recent announcement that Minecraft is switching to a faster "feature development rhythm". It's seemingly reminiscent of the days before Microsoft bought Mojang, when features arrived in more of a when-they're-ready fashion rather than at the bidding of a seasonal "content drop" cadence.</p>
<p>"Instead of providing one free update during the summer, as we've done in the past, we'll now be releasing a number of free game drops throughout the year," <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development">reads a post on the game's official site</a> from Minecraft general manager Ryan Cooper. "These game drops will vary in size and will bring you features to explore more frequently."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear what "game drops" amounts to, but recent updates contain a few clues. "Sharp-eyed players will have spotted our first trial of these drops all the way back in December 2023, when we made visual changes to bats and turned decorated pots into functional storage containers," the post continues. "Next came Armored Paws - which included armadillos, wolf variations, and wolf armor - and released in April 2024.</p>
<p>"And that's not all our developers will be working on. Minecraft is a game that has been growing since it first released, and alongside these regular content drops, our developers will be focusing on long-term initiatives to ensure we can continue to evolve Minecraft long into the future," the post concludes.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't quite end there. They also mention that they're bringing "a native version of Minecraft to the PlayStation 5", but I don't know what a PlayStation 5 is and neither do you. They're also "exploring ways to improve Minecraft's multiplayer experience and make it easier to find and connect with friends".</p>
<p>If you don't want to update your mods to keep pace with Minecraft's updates, you'll need to stick with an older version of the game. Mojang made this easier a while back by letting you pick versions from the game's launcher, albeit only on Java rather than the console-specific Bedrock edition. They've also tried to make modding Minecraft easier by means of tools like the data pack system. Still, modders may feel obliged to update their creations to take advantage of new features. </p>
<p>It's strictly anecdotal social media ephemera, not an accurate snapshot of the mood, but I've seen a <a href="https://x.com/legend_xt_oli/status/1833167576987312555">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/SixFootBlue/status/1833177375573418192">arsey</a> <a href="https://x.com/obser_vic/status/1833189234544369914">replies</a> to Cooper's post above. Mind you, all of that is somewhat lost in the <a href="https://x.com/2022krl/status/1833167677948379512">celebrations</a> over the parallel announcement that Mojang are retiring the Mob Vote, a regular fan vote on adding creatures to the game that has cultivated community grudges that go back nigh a decade. Did you vote for the Phantom back in 2017? I hope all your precious mods turn to ashes in your mouth.</p><hr>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Changed the action pattern when the battle starts.</li>
<li>Adjusted some attack moves.</li>
<li>Decreased the damage of some attacks.</li>
<li>Decreased stamina damage of some attacks.</li>
<li>Decreased the attack range of some non-weapon-based attacks.</li>
<li>Improved the visibility of some attack effects.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you peeve the pee, you may also find these of passing interest:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Decreased the damage of Backhand Blades against other players. (The Smithscript Cirque's throwing attacks are not affected by this change)</li>
<li>Decreased the damage of Spears’ dual wield attacks against other players.</li>
<li>Decreased the damage of the Pata weapon against other players.</li>
<li>The “Spread Crossbow” weapon will no longer cause the headshot damage motion when hitting another player.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>There are also a host of other changes for various weapon arts, alongside some bug fixes. This one wins my personal award for “most likely to get you sectioned if you mention it to anyone who doesn’t play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>’:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the player from becoming translucent when the Crepus’ Vial Talisman is equipped and the Unseen Form Spell is used.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>“Erdtree is closer to Souls of old, with a more focused interlocking map and locales that seem more adventurous, bleaker, weirder,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">review-edly spoke</a> Edders. “I do think its sheer density makes it frustrating at times, as seeking out optional areas to level up means seeking out routes you never would've fathomed.

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony announced the long-rumoured digital-only PS5 Pro</a>. This souped-up version of the PlayStation 5 will allow for Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates, but it comes with a cost. When it goes on sale later this year, it will retail at £700 for those of us here in the UK. Another £100 is then required to purchase the separate disc drive with a further £25 to buy the vertical stand.</p>
<p>The price point differential between the original PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro is "between 40-50 percent", Harding-Rolls noted, adding this is "significantly more than the differential between the PS4 and PS4 Pro" on its launch.</p>

<p>"In the US, the PS4 Pro launched at $399 and the slim PS4 was $299 at the time, a 33 percent differential," Harding-Rolls said. "Additionally, the slim PS4 had a retail price of $299 having dropped from the original PS4 launch price of $399."</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls stated Sony's PS5 Pro pricing reflects the company's "adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation".</p>
<p>He noted Microsoft had its Xbox One X console geared up during the last console generation. However, as the PlayStation maker doesn't have this same competition right now, "it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins" with the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>"For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot," Harding-Rolls said.</p>

<p>Despite this, Ampere predicts "around 1.3m PS5 Pro consoles will be bought by consumers in the 2024 launch window". In comparison, the PS4 Pro sold 1.7m units on its launch.</p>
<p>"We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration," Harding-Rolls said.  "According to Ampere data, over its life, the PS4 Pro sold-through 14.5m units, around 12 percent of total PS4 sales."</p>
<p>Ampere is currently expecting the PS5 Pro to "sell-through around 13m units" come 2029.</p>
<p>"Sony’s PlayStation business is now more global than ever," Harding-Rolls closed. "Eight years on from when the PS4 Pro came to market, PS5 is selling strongly in countries where there are increasing numbers of consumers with growing disposable income such as mainland China and Saudi Arabia. These markets represent a growing opportunity for PlayStation versus the PS4 generation."</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">Sony reportedly confirmed "about 40 or 50 or games" will get PS5 Pro upgrade patches</a> when the console launches on 7th November.</p>
<p>So far, Sony has only officially named 13 games set to receive PS5 Pro upgrades on launch day, meaning there's still plenty more to be shared.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Commence Star Wars rolling prologue screen: A minority Ubisoft investor has written an open letter to Ubisoft's board outlining their "deep dissatisfaction with the current performance and strategic direction of the company" and threatening a full-blown coup against the Guillemot brothers, Ubisoft's founders, and their backers at Chinese juggernaut Tencent. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the letter (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-share-price-tumbles-again-as-minority-investor-calls-for-the-company-to-go-private">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) Juraj Krupa of Sloakian hedgefund AJ Investments and Partners <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf">cites</a> the delaying of future instalments of Rainbow Six: Siege and The Division together with a lowered revenue outlook for Q2 2024 as cause for shareholder upset, noting that Ubisoft's share price has fallen by over 40% since last year. Accordingly, Krupa wants the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to strategic investor", who will "get new air into" Ubisoft's videogames by, amongst other things, carrying out a bunch of layoffs. They're giving the board 60 days to reply.
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments are even now talking to other shareholders with a view to overthrowing the Guillemots. They're going to "use the French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and initiate SALE PROCESS of Ubisoft to increase shareholder value for all shareholders". In particular, Krupa is calling for long-term CEO Yves Guillemot to be given the boot.
</p>
<p>
"The main reason why the valuation is so low compared to the peers is that Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them," the letter reads. "Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers." 
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments appear to be new kids on the block as Ubisoft minority shareholders. According to Krupa, "we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and are still adding to it". They do, however, boast of their "extensive knowledge about the gaming industry" after being a "long-term shareholder in Activision Blizzard".
</p>
<p>
"We cannot understand the decision-making process of current management that is focused on releasing multiple average games per year that are harming Ubisoft's reputation among gamers community instead of focusing to provide hit games within its exceptional franchise portfolio," Krupa's letter continues. There follows a breakdown of Ubisoft's handling of their games which, frankly, reads like a frothing forum post full of gamer punditry:
</p>
<p>
"Division Heartland which was very much expected game from the gamers was cancelled. Skull and Bones release was not a success, Prince of Persia Lost Crown was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore. Rainbow Siege is doing great, nevertheless franchises such Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, Watch Dogs are sleeping for years despite these games are loved by millions of players all around the world. Latest release of Star Wars Outlaws is expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that whole world was waiting for open-world game under the Star Wars franchise. The Metacritic rating was 76% and IGN has 7/10 rating, which is quite good rating in our view."
</p>
<p>
Krupa, you debonair chancer, you Machiavellian oaf! Forget going toe to toe with the Guillemot dynasty - describing 7/10 as a "quite good rating" is how wars get started. Also, you forgot to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are some spicier assertions in the paragraph below. Krupa thinks that Tencent and the Guillemot brothers' holding company are essentially in cahoots to stop Ubisoft being acquired by private equity firms such as KKR and Blackstone - with Tencent buying shares in the Guillemot holding company in 2022, and the Guillemots then buying up more Ubisoft shares "to prevent any future acquisition or takeovers that would make Ubisoft operations more effective and agile against its competitors."
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments believe that Tencent and the Guillemot family are keeping the share price low so that they can scoop up shares on the cheap and eventually take full control of Ubisoft. While he doesn't say that it's a deliberate part of this strategy, Krupa suggests that delaying games is "beneficial" for Tencent and the Guillemots on this count.
</p>
<p>
Hence, AJ Investments' desire to start a shareholder rebellion. Krupa asserts that minority shareholders "own roughly 70% of the company", versus the roughly 25% of shares owned by the Guillemots and Tencent, and as such "based on our talks with other shareholders, we believe that we have enough voting power to challenge Guillemot's". So what would such a takeover and change of leadership bring about? Well, what does any major company strategic readjustment seem to result in these days? You guessed it, more layoffs! 
</p>
<p>
"The company needs to implement significant cost reductions and staff optimization to improve operational efficiency," Krupa adds. "We also suggest that Ubisoft should consider selling certain studios that are not needed for development of main IP's in the portfolio. Ubisoft has over 30 studios, it's obvious to every investor that this structure is too large for Ubisoft and its profitability going forward." He acknowledges "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">layoffs</a> that Ubisoft has made in the recent years which accounted to approximately of 10% cut of workforce but that is simply not enough."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, AJ Investments want Ubisoft's current management gone, with the Guillemots continuing in "an advisory capacity" alongside a new, more "efficient" CEO. They also want Ubisoft to go private, because "Ubisoft as a public company is under ongoing scrutiny to report better and better quarterly results to please investors which may harm strategy going forward and is harming Ubisoft at this time, when they need to think long-term to get new air into their exceptional franchises".
</p>
<p>
To me, all this is sort of Aliens vs Predator, except that the Alien and the Predator are cool movie monsters, rather than angry suits fighting for the biggest chunk of a billion dollar company. Best of luck to any Ubisoft developers worrying about the potential fallout.

            <p>If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">shuttered</a> its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">revoked their purchases</a>. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739">Xwitter post</a>, Ubisoft put out a short video saying that they're "currently exploring different solutions", and "can confirm an offline mode". It's more than likely this is in response to how they handled both the previous games' shut down. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/holy-cow-the-crew-2-is-on-sale-for-dollar1-on-steam/">PC Gamer notes</a>, the game is also currently on sale for $1, which is objectively a good deal.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games</p><p>Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. </p><p>We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles, stay tuned for more news in the next months. <a href="https://t.co/pZhx4WUBPT">pic.twitter.com/pZhx4WUBPT</a></p></div>— Ubisoft_UK (@Ubisoft_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_UK/status/1833543517596954728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Even when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/need-for-speed-shift-2-the-run-and-more-ending-multiplayer-this-year">EA turned off the online servers for a tonne of Need For Speed games</a> in 2021, they were at least playable offline. Then again, The Crew 2 sells itself more heavily as an online game. Turning off the servers means it'll likely be a lonely experience even if it's still playable.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">single player review</a>, John Walker (RPS in peace) deemed it "an awful lot of not very much", which doesn't bode all too well for when Ubisoft's pit crews arrive and bolt in the offline mode (unless they announce local co-op or something?). Mind you, John wasn't impressed by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trying-and-failing-to-find-the-multiplayer-in-the-crew-2">multiplayer offerings</a>, either. "The Crew 2, an online only game, has no inherent multiplayer at all", he said. "Up to four of you can group together as a "crew" and take on its scant co-op challenges. That's it." </p>
<p>I've not played The Crew 2 so I can't comment. The closest I've come to playing a driving game recently is when I logged into Fortnite and the season at the time had you driving Mad Max-style vehicles. Honestly? The best driving game I've played as of late was Warzone's late Armored Royale mode. I still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keep-armored-royale-as-a-permanent-mode-in-warzone-you-cowards">think about it often</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has released a new patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, version 1.14, which adjusts the final boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to make it easier.</p>
<p>It's been three months since the DLC was released and many players have struggled to beat its final boss - it's an incredibly tricky challenge in an already difficult game.</p>
<p>Now, changes have been made to ensure more players can finish Shadow of the Erdtree. Notably, the start of battle has been changed to give players a chance to settle into the fight - indeed, many of the DLC's bosses immediately attack the player upon entering an arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, some attack moves of the boss have been adjusted, with damage dealt decreased, stamina damage decreased, reduced attack range of some non-weapon attacks, and improved visibility of some attack effects.</p>
<p>That last one is important, as this particular boss has plenty of flashy gold effects that can make it hard to clearly see certain attacks.</p>
<p>Other adjustments in this patch include balance changes for PvP play, as well as general changes to some equipment, improvements to some weapon arts, and tweaks to various spells.</p>
<p>Bug fixes have also been implemented, and the patch notes include suggestions to improve unstable performance.

<p>What's not included in these patch notes is any mention of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-removes-latin-american-translation-staff-from-credits">translation staff who were removed from the credits</a> after the release of Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been less than a day since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement of the PS5 Pro console</a>. The biggest news (largely a shock) was certainly Sony's pricing choice, but when it came to the hardware features, they were mostly in line with the leaks.</p>
<p>As early as July 2023, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the upgraded PlayStation 5 would feature 'accelerated ray tracing'. This March, YouTube channel Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> from a leaked document that ray tracing performance could be twice or even thrice as fast as the original PlayStation 5, which was confirmed yesterday by Sony:</p>
<p><em><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</em></p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro GPU is mainly based on the RDNA 3 architecture, it will anticipate several ray tracing enhancements that won't be seen until next year in AMD's first RDNA 4 PC graphics cards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Ray Tracing Intersect Engine</li>
<li>RT Instance Node Transform</li>
<li>64B RT Node</li>
<li>Ray Tracing Tri-Pair Optimization</li>
<li>Change flags encoded in barycentric to simplify the detection of procedural nodes</li>
<li>BVH Footprint Improvement</li>
<li>RT support for OBB and Instance Node Intersection</li>
</ul>
<p>According to another leak, it may also include thread reordering to reduce data and execution divergence, similar to NVIDIA's Shader Execution Reordering (introduced with the Ada Lovelace architecture) and Intel Arc's Thread Sorting Unit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> that Sony drove the development of these advanced ray tracing features at AMD.</p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, while AMD GPUs compete well enough in rasterization, they've historically trailed behind NVIDIA in this area. RDNA 4 hardware, starting with the PS5 Pro this November, is looking to change all that at a time when more and more game developers are implementing ray tracing in their games. Of course, NVIDIA is unlikely to rest on its laurels and may well have something up its sleeves for the GeForce RTX 50 Series 'Blackwell' GPUs, whose design is expected to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-550w-5080-350w-september-design-fianlize-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished this month</a> for a tentative announcement at CES 2025.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest “to ensure long-term access” for the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the original The Crew would be taken offline due to “upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints”. The news didn’t sit well with the fans, with many expressing disappointment all across social media. Additionally, the community took it upon themselves to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-is-being-revived-just-months-after-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive the game</a>, with a dedicated team working to get it running by the Crew’s 10th anniversary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that Ubisoft understands the community’s sentiment and is committed to providing long-term access to both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. According to the new video on <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers are “currently exploring different solutions and can confirm an offline mode” for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. More details about the offline mode will be revealed in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games</p><p>Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. </p><p>We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles, stay tuned for more news in the next months. <a href="https://t.co/KDlz8h09OT">pic.twitter.com/KDlz8h09OT</a></p></div>— The Crew Motorfest (@TheCrewGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are online-only racing games, the former released in 2018 and the latter in 2023. The decision to introduce an offline mode for these games has gone well with the fans, with many <a href="https://x.com/KlassikerGamer/status/1833632300824682976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praising</a> Ubisoft’s decision. However, some still wonder whether an offline mode is possible for the <a href="https://x.com/DyhZar_/status/1833543606696554961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original game</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressurised to go private</a> as share prices continue to fall. Also, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vulkan-api-rainbow-six-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped Vulcan API </a>from Rainbow Six Siege.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft Ivory Tower have announced that both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/the-crew-2-review/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> will be getting support for offline play in a future update, ensuring that they will remain playable long after the servers are eventually shut down.</p>
<p>To mark this announcement, Ubisoft have put both games on sale for the next two weeks. The Crew Motorfest is reduced by up to 70% – it’s cheapest on PC at £18, while the Xbox Deluxe Edition is £22.50, and PlayStation seemingly hasn’t put discounts in place just yet. But you want an absolute steal? Well,&nbsp;you can get The Crew 2 for just 79p!</p>


<p>Say it with me:</p>
<p><iframe title="Robocop - I'd Buy That For a Dollar" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/85cL1HisrNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patching in an offline mode is huge for game preservation, and it will also help Ubisoft get back some good will after making the original The Crew completely inaccessible to play with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">that game’s server shutdown earlier this year</a>. Now, The Crew 2 was a much better game than The Crew, but still, it sucks to see games effectively disappearing.</p>

<p>Motorfest owners have a lot to look forward to, as Ivory Tower announced plans for Year 2 in the game’s post-launch support. It will get its biggest update yet on 6th November, with the game map getting 50% bigger when they add the entire island of Maui… for free!</p>
<p>This will be integrated seamlessly, so you’ll be able to head over to the new island by sea, by air, or by driving across a connecting bridge, without any loading screens.</p>
<p>Once again, the team will be trying to honour real life with an abstracted recreation, though it will feature real roads and locations with the road to Hana, bamboo forests, waterfalls, Kaihalulu beach’s red sands, Haleakalā National Park, and more.</p>
<p>Year 2 will have another seasonal content plan, though with three seasons instead of 4. This will start with Season 5 and a new Made in Japan Volume 2 playlist. There will also be a new PvE mode included in the Year 2 Pass called The Chase Squad, which sadly won’t feature Bradley Walsh, but will have you trying to hunt down racing rivals across the island.</p>
<p>The Year 2 Pass is included with new versions of the Gold and Ultimate editions of The Crew Motorfest, or sold separately. It will add 20 more vehicles, nine of which are there on day one and the other 11 added in monthly drops through the year.</p>
<p>Launching last September, we said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest review</a>, “The Crew Motorfest provides plenty of fun arcade racing, though it does very little to break new ground for the genre. There’s plenty to get your teeth into, but there are some annoying design decisions and a few technical issues that take the shine off it. Still, I can see it finding plenty of fans, particularly on PS5 where the only competition from a ‘Horizon’ game involves robotic dinosaurs.”</p>

            <p>Abandon all hope, ye who are shackled to your workmates in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>. The "co-op" game about escaping hell now has a map editor that'll let you make your own infuriating obstacle courses for condemned souls to throw themselves upon. Finally, you can make the endless mountain of perdition you have dreamed about since being emotionally scarred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update is designed to unleash your creativity," say developers Anegar Games in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">brief patch notes</a>. The editor will let you place moving platforms, swinging axes, pulsating spikes, and all the rest of the game's horrendous machinery. There are a few levels already up in the Steam Workshop, including the one pictured above, in which I slipped to my death five times before quitting to desktop. You win this time, spinning log. </p>
<p>We at RPS have already enjoyed a brief foray into the fiery pits. It was a journey that saw Edwin, Nic and I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">bickering about the correct way to perform a countdown</a> before committing to deadly leaps and scrambled sprints. The darkest place in hell is reserved for those who run into a gauntlet of lasers insisting "let's just eyeball it, boys".</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> multiplayer platformer Chained Together is cheap, silly, and unsurprisingly janky. In other words, pure streamer bait - the video game as meme. But I often admire games like this for their playground simplicity. It reminds me of Sen's Fortress as much as it does Bennet Foddy's cauldronised clamberer. Nic called it a "layer cake of fuckery", a description both accurate and pleasing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The esports industry has suffered from various challenges and tribulations over the last few years, and the path it has followed to become as big as it is has been a weary one. It’s not over yet, though. Sadly, many issues still plague the industry that leave people asking the question: ‘Is esports dying?’</p>



<p>In this walkthrough, we’re identifying the biggest blockers that are preventing the esports industry from being considered profitable and sustainable. If you’ve been wondering whether esports is a good career path to follow, you’ll want to check out this guide first.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-esports">What’s Wrong With Esports?</h2>



<p>The esports industry has suffered under the weight of many long-standing problems for more than a decade. It ebbs and flows like any other market, but it’s especially volatile, leading to organisations dipping in and out of the industry with an alarming regularity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it almost always comes down to <strong>dollars and cents</strong>. In the last few years, we’ve seen funding, investments, and cash on hand dwindle across the wider market, but at the same time, player and staff salaries have remained almost <strong>too high</strong>. </p>



<p>In terms of companies, the market is fast becoming saturated. More <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-teams-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports teams</a> are surfacing every day, but the structure of major esports tournaments doesn’t tend to change, which means there isn’t ‘enough room’ to accommodate these aspiring organisations.</p>



<p>That being said, viewership is increasing, the number of fans supporting the industry is growing, and other revenue streams, such as betting, merchandising, and brand sponsorship deals, remain quite consistent.</p>



<h2 id="h-so-is-esports-dying-now">So, Is Esports Dying Now?</h2>



<p>Esports isn’t dying, but it is still recovering from a monumental boom that ballooned the industry to epic proportions in a relatively short time. We saw hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the esports industry, and some tournaments exploded, pulling in staggering prize pools that ultimately proved unsustainable.</p>



<p>It’s now a matter of adjusting on a global scale.</p>



<p>It can be argued that sports and esports are nothing without the fans and the viewers, and that’s where the esports industry shines. Most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games</a> are seeing a growth in viewership that’s nothing short of promising.</p>



<p>Here are some key examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>Six Invitational 2024 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 521,374 users and kickstarted a popularity boom for the game.</li>



<li>The <strong>League of Legends World Championship 2023 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 6,402,760 users, setting a new world record for the esports industry.</li>



<li>The <strong>FNCS 2024 Global Championship </strong>became the most-watched Fortnite tournament in five years, securing a peak viewer count of 809,854.</li>



<li>The <strong>PGL Major Copenhagen 2024 </strong>proved to be a huge boost for Counter-Strike 2, landing a peak viewer count of 1,853,954 users.</li>
</ul>



<p>The global fanbase is growing, and that means more ticket and merchandise sales. It also means better stability for investors and sponsors who are slowly but surely coming back into the fold. It means more ad revenue from boosted streams, co-streaming opportunities, and more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-guide/">esports bettors</a> going out and placing wagers.</p>



<p>It’s tough for new esports games to surface, but that doesn’t mean developers have stopped trying. In recent months, we’ve seen the likes of The Finals, Spectre Divide, Tarkov Arena, Deadlock, Stormgate, and XDefiant all surface with the desire to become an esports game.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the appetite is there to make something special out of the esports industry. With almost half a billion enthusiasts worldwide, there’s a solid fanbase pooling, and with the likes of the Esports World Cup and the Olympic Esports Games trying hard to add further legitimacy to the industry, we’re likely only a few years away from a much more sustainable position.</p>
