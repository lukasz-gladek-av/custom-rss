            <p>

</p>
<p>
Then, as the month progresses, there's some chaotic multiplayer infiltration in Filthy Animals: Heist Simulator, fantasy action in FATE: The Traitor Soul, a bit of tactical roguelite deck-building in Necroking, a splash of old-school D&amp;D in the Silver Box Classics bundle, and more.

            <p>Microsoft have brought development work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/contraband">Contraband</a>, the co-op smuggling game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios announced back in 2021, to a standstill. That's the official line, while a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/xbox-drops-work-on-contraband-video-game-after-four-years">Bloomberg</a> claims the game's been cancelled outright.</p>
<p>Nothing had been been seen or heard of Contraband since its reveal to the world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">at E3 four years ago</a>, and this sudden status update comes just weeks after Microsoft cancelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a>, and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">mass layoffs that saw around 9,000 staff lose their livelihoods</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios Group and Xbox Game Studios Publishing have collaborated on Contraband," reads a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/contraband-update">statement</a> Avalanche put out last night. "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project’s future. We’re thankful for the excitement we’ve seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what’s next as soon as we can."</p>
<p>That statement's arrival followed reports from both Bloomberg and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development">Game File</a> about Contraband's fate. The former saw Jason Schreier claim that this halt to development isn't just a pause, but a full-blown cancellation decided on by Microsoft. Meanwhile, the latter said that the game has been put "on hold", linking the news to Microsoft's July layoffs - which saw cuts in Xbox’s publishing division that works with outside development studios.</p>
<p>We'd already seen the consequences of those cuts and the call to stop funding several unnanounced games, with Romero Games having funding for their upcoming FPS pulled, leaving them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">searching for a new publisher</a> to get the project over the line. Some third-party games, including Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-horror-game-with-jordan-peele-and-its-called-od">OD</a>, are reportedly unaffected.</p>
<p>Contraband's premise sounds very cool - you and your mates smuggling goods across borders in "the fictional Southeast Asian world of 1970s Bayan". That E3 trailer, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuri4lT7jI">set to private</a> on Xbox's English YouTube channel (but is still up on the Mexican one), had some Steely Dan in the background.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again," go the lyrics. "Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round. You go back, Jack, do it again."</p>
<p>We'll have to see where the wheel for Avalanche, over 500 staff at whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">unionised last year</a>, turns next. That's assuming this truly is is the last stop for Contraband's convoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals has a year’s worth of new characters planned, and preparation 12 months in advance for new heroes is underway, Marvel Rivals Director Guangguang has revealed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>New heroes are one of the core features of Marvel Rivals, which has transitioned into introducing a new hero every half-season, and the next 12 months of content are prepared.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a> in Guangzhou, Guangguang revealed that initial work has begun on characters set to be released this time next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-character-development-takes-about-a-year">Marvel Rivals Character Development Takes ‘About a Year’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blade is the newest Marvel Rivals character. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>It takes “about a year” to bring a new character into <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, with a long list of work to be done that includes gameplay aspects, concept art, modelling, animation, and voice acting. Therefore, content is planned for the next 12 months and beyond.</p>



<p>While other games have adopted a yearly roadmap for content drops, highlighting what players can expect in the months ahead, Guangguang explained why the preferred approach for Rivals is to reveal new content at the start of each season to maintain “freshness and surprises.”</p>



<p>This approach also allows the Rivals team to keep a close eye on what the playerbase and Marvel fans are enjoying most, paying attention to their discussions to see how that can inspire the team to see what they can come up with.</p>



<p>One of the most highly requested additions from the community is Deadpool, but Guangguang did not confirm whether Wade Wilson is on the release schedule for the next year, telling fans to “stay tuned” for future reveals.</p>



<p>Which character is at the top of your wishlist in Marvel Rivals? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>For the longest time, I’ve associated Japanese developer MAGES with absolute anime nerd (weab) slop. Now, as a massive weab, I say that in the most endearing and well-meaning way. The dense sci-fi visual novel adventures of Steins;Gate&nbsp;and the schlocky, shocking horror of&nbsp;Corpse Party&nbsp;are some of my favorite games, but in the last year, I’ve come to appreciate MAGES for a series of games that their work on has seemed to be relatively unnoticed. The recent Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;remakes on Nintendo Switch were developed in part by MAGES, including the incredible new entry Emio – The Smiling Man.&nbsp;Delivering an incredibly mature, slow, ominous, and grounded visual novel detective mystery, it ended up as one of my favourite games of 2024. It’s no wonder I ended up loving Iwakura Aria, as it shares so much of that same DNA and style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Iwakura Aria | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSiPbhGA-AY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Iwakura Aria wastes no time delivering a drab and dour opening. In 1966, in the wake of the war, Japan is full of orphaned children with no reliable path forward. One such child is our protagonist, Ichiko Kitagawa, who clings to hope as she scrapes by and spends her time illustrating. One day, though, her art catches the eye of a mysterious man, who ends up being the head of the prestigious Iwakura household. Almost on sight, he invites her to join the household as a maid, giving her a home and a path forward, but for seemingly no clear reason or benefit to himself. The dominoes of uncertainty slowly tumble onward from there, as Ichiko gets familiar with the mansion, picks up on the secrets bubbling within it, and begins to bond with Aria, the heiress of the family.</p>



<p>The events of&nbsp;Iwakura Aria&nbsp;don’t immediately have a hostile or ominous air to them, but what makes that sense of dread creep through is the incredible aesthetic of the game. Every character is rendered in a gorgeous, detailed, painterly style that is reminiscent of&nbsp;The House of Fata Morgana.&nbsp;The backgrounds, though, are a bit sharper, a bit more realistic, and swathed with incredibly realistic shadows and lighting. The result is an unsettling tonal clash that kept me with a cold-sweat the entire time I was playing.</p>

<p>In an early scene, Ichiko uncovers a dark and dimly lit room that contains a wardrobe full of knives, hammers, and guns. The way household-head Amane Iwakura’s bright character art contrasts against the dark, foreboding room as he gaslights our protagonist into not worrying about the content of the wardrobe is incredible and sinister.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, Ichiko falls deeper and deeper into the hellish secrets of the Iwakura household. What I appreciated most about this game is that uncovering those secrets and seeing Ichiko’s story through to it’s bitter end doesn’t take long at all. The adventure wraps up in a dozen or so hours, which is light and brief compared to the gargantuan 40-80 hour runtimes of most other mystery VNs, including MAGES own Steins;Gate series. The brief runtime helps paper over some of Iwakura Aria’s weaker points, too – investigation gameplay is here, but often feels more arbitrary or forced than it does engaging or enticing. There’s also a surprising lack of expression variations for character sprites or unique illustrated CGs.</p>
<p>Still, those qualms are minor in the grand scheme of things. Iwakura Aria is an incredibly insightful, grim, and engaging visual novel that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The combination of dark subject matter and beautiful character art creates one of the most interesting visual novel experiences I’ve ever played, and is well worth checking out for anyone interested in a more grounded mystery VN experience.</p>

			<p>A new media blast for Ninja Gaiden 4 went out yesterday, and YouTuber GamersPrey has uploaded a full hour of new gameplay with absolutely no commentary attached. It's a feast for the eyes of all those fans who feared the franchise was dead. They had every right to believe so, given that the previous entry, Ninja Gaiden 3, launched in 2012 and received middling reviews to boot.</p>



<p>Now, the action series is coming back, and it is doing so with a sort of 'dream collaboration' between historic developer Team Ninja and fellow Japanese developer PlatinumGames, who is also known for acclaimed action titles like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and the Bayonetta franchise. </p>



<p>Speaking about this partnership in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryp7yKdq5Bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Iron Lords Podcast</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama from Team Ninja explained:</p>



<p><em>Well, for Team Ninja, Ninja Gaiden is a very important IP and title, so we have always wanted to create a new Ninja Gaiden game. Initially, the presidents of our company, Mr. Ono from Team Ninja, and Mr. Inaba from PlatinumGames, who are actually of the same generation and have had ongoing exchanges, discussed whether the two companies could collaborate on something new. Given PlatinumGames’ excellent track record with action games like Nier and Bayonetta, which we respect greatly, we thought it would be a great challenge to work together on a new Ninja Gaiden title. Furthermore, as you mentioned, with support from Phil Spencer at Xbox, the project was able to come together with a three-way collaboration</em>.</p>

"We have gone through structural reform [with Bungie], as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding."

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-party">LEGO Party</a>, the upcoming multiplayer party game, is building towards an official launch next month with the game slated to release on September 30th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Party! - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KPCZUY4s-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Announced earlier this year during the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/summer-games-fest">Summer Games Fest</a>, LEGO Party does exactly what it says on the tin. Developed by Aussie outfit, SMG Studio, and published by Fictions, this new licensed LEGO video game hurls four players into a vibrant, board game-like gauntlet where they must compete to earn the highest number of gold bricks.</p>
<p>Clearly, the developer (who also worked on the brilliant <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/moving-out">Moving Out</a> series) is looking to emulate some of Nintendo’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-party">Mario Party</a> magic. As players navigate the board in LEGO Party, they will land on spaces that transport them to one of 60 mini games.</p>
<p>What sets the game apart from main influence, of course, is its LEGO universe setting. Instead of leaning on crossover IPs such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, or Marvel, Party features scenes and characters from familiar themed sets including Space, Pirates, and Ninjago. One of the game’s main draws for LEGO fans will be collecting various character customisation components, with over a billion minifigure combinations.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game appeals to you, it’s been interesting to see the uptick in more experimental LEGO video games that don’t lean on popular franchises. For a good long while, developer Traveller’s Tales was dropping new LEGO games year after year, plumbing every Star Wars film, both the Marvel and DC comic book universes, and more. Always a hit with younger audiences, the overarching blueprint of these games was beginning to stale until 2022’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which evolved the formula with its open-world focus and free camera.</p>
<p>More recently, we’ve had games of all shapes and genres from LEGO 2K Drive and LEGO Bricktales to the upcoming LEGO Voyagers, complimenting Epic’s ongoing free-to-play LEGO Fortnite. Exactly where LEGO Party will ranked among these games is something we’ll be finding out very soon.</p>

              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197">controversy erupted</a> around the art for an animated card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s latest set, Wisdom of Sea and Sky, where a drawing of legendary monster Ho-Oh looked almost identical to that of a piece of commissioned art by a Chinese creator. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">The Pokémon Company swiftly apologized</a>, and announced the art for both the “immersive” Ho-Oh and Lugia cards would be temporarily pulled from the new set, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1950406273150693652%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">while making it extremely clear</a> that the fault for the issue did not lie with the artist. Now, both cards have been added to the mobile app, with new art by the same artist.</p> <p>Every set of cards in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> comes with at least one so-called immersive card: a card that when tapped on comes to life, showing a short but elaborate animation that eventually loops back around to the original image. They’re absolutely magical, and offer something real-life cards could obviously never do. For Wisdom of Sea, those cards were intended to feature legendary Pokémon Ho-oh and Lugia, the two mascot characters from 2000’s <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>. However, when the artist whose Ho-Oh drawing had been so clearly been copied drew attention to this, both immersive cards were pulled from the set at the eleventh hour–the result being both cards featuring nothing but some placeholder text and a black screen instead of an animation. It was clearly embarrassing for the company. TPCi made it clear at the time that the responsibility for the issue lay entirely with themselves, providing dodgy reference materials for the artist to work with.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616592"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616592">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It was odd at the time that both cards were pulled, given no accusations had been made about the Lugia art, but today’s new cards feature a brand new piece of art for that Pokémon too, suggesting TPCi noticed something had been amiss there.</p>

 <p>That’s all been fixed now, with both cards added to the set overnight, featuring a brand new pieces of Ho-Oh and Lugia art from the same artist, the excellent Sie Nanahara. When you launch the app today, a very small patch will be added, and if you already pulled the cards you’ll find the new art and animations will appear.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We'd like to share a new update with you. Please take a look. 🙇 <a href="https://t.co/Gh6wgL7G3Z">pic.twitter.com/Gh6wgL7G3Z</a></p> <p>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1953683542182924568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By sheer luck I’d pulled both immersive cards already, so when I started&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> first thing this morning, as is my routine, I was able to watch both animations, and they’re both utterly splendid. Each shows the legendary pocket monster either descending from the sky or rising from the sea to meet their counterpart, with all manner of other Pokémon appearing along the way. (Including, in the Lugia animation, my beloved Mantine.) Oddly enough, those strange rectangular artifacts on the original Ho-Oh card remain, the elements sliding apart as the animation begins.</p> <p>Sie Nanahara is responsible for all the incredible art in both cards, which is clearly a stunning amount of work, and includes a brand new rendition of Ho-Oh and Lugia. While <em>Pokémon</em> card art is usually based on each artist’s own vision, when it comes to the immersive cards it’s become clear that far more precise instructions are provided, and this is how things went wrong. It’s excellent that Nanahara has been able to react so quickly to demonstrate her skill, and hopefully this whole messy incident will result in her receiving far more work.</p>

			<p>Sony executives shared <span>many details on PlayStation strategies during the <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_02_en/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company's Q1 2025 investors call Q&amp;A</a>. For example, we&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/" target="_blank">received confirmation</a>&nbsp;that there will be a shift from a hardware-centric business model to a platform business model focused on engagement&nbsp;</span>beyond PlayStation consoles.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">reported</a> earlier from the Q&amp;A that Bungie's Marathon is expected to launch by March 2026. Bungie is set to lose most of its independence as it slowly gets absorbed into PlayStation Studios, despite initial statements at the time of the acquisition. The thorn subject of PlayStation live service games was touched repeatedly during the Q&amp;A, and Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao admitted that the plan (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally targeted 10 live service games released by March 2026</a>) hasn't gone as smoothly as they would have liked. At the same time, she pointed out that it's not all doom and gloom, and those lessons will be helpful for future projects.</p>



<p><em>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord was canceled</a>, and this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon was postponed</a>, so somewhat negative news has been coming out. But if you look at the we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. Now, we have&nbsp;Helldivers 2, MLB The Show and&nbsp;Gran Turismo 7, and&nbsp;Bungie's&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;2, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner. For Q1 2025, live service ratio was about 40%. For the full year, it's a little less, probably between 20 to 30%. So, in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change. Of course, we recognize that there are still issues, many issues, so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there's less waste and it's more smooth.</em></p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation success in the live service segment, but it didn't even come from a first-party studio. That alone is telling in how much Sony still has to learn to be successful in this elusive category of gaming. Marathon's fate will no doubt mark a pivotal moment - will it soar like Helldivers 2 or flounder right away like Concord? We'll know more in a few months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Executive Confirms That PlayStation Is Moving Away from the Hardware Business Toward a Platform Business]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-executive-confirms-that-playstation-is-moving-away-from-the-hardware-business-toward-a-platform-business.1265379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Sony announced the quarterly financial results for Q1 2025, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the PlayStation 5 console had shipped 80.3 million units as of the end of June. The whole Game and Network Services (G&amp;NS) segment registered an 8% year-on-year increase in sales of 936.5 billion yen ($6.35 billion), primarily due to the rise in third-party software sales, which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>



<p>As a consequence of the recent strong user engagement trend, Sony has upwardly revised their fiscal year 2025 forecast for sales slightly from last time to 4 trillion 320 billion yen ($29.31 billion), as well as the forecast for operating income by 4% to 500 billion yen ($3.39 billion). Year-on-year, user engagement continued to increase, with the number of monthly active users (MAUs) across PlayStation increasing by 6% in June compared to the same month last year, reaching 123 million accounts. Total playtime for the quarter also increased by 6% year-on-year.</p>



<p>Sony also said that operating income increased approximately 2.3x year-on-year to 148 billion yen ($1 billion), a new quarterly record high for the segment. This was primarily due to the impact of the increased sales of third-party software and an increase in network services revenue.</p>



<p>But arguably the most interesting tidbit, at least for gamers, came from the subsequent Q&amp;A with investors, where Sadahiko Hayakawa, Senior Vice President in charge of Finance and IR at Sony, said:</p>



<p><em>In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement.</em></p>



<p>The Q&amp;A is available <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_01_ja/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and the translation was <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953491713693217147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X</a> along with the news by Tokyo-based user Genki_JPN, who often reports on Japanese news. This aligns with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-appears-preparing-port-more-playstation-exclusives/">recently discovered job listing</a> for a Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, which hinted that Sony would bring even more games not only to PC but also to Xbox and Nintendo platforms, too, in an effort to increase PlayStation users (those elusive monthly active users, or MAUs).</p>



<p>So far, it was believed that it might be limited to live service games such as Helldivers 2, but that caveat was seemingly not specified this time. If such a business shift were to be confirmed, it would mean that Nintendo alone will keep making first-party games for its own consoles only, essentially heralding the end of the console wars.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-3-600-bans-issued-in-21-days.1265373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has taken to social media to announce that 3,600 <strong>more cheaters </strong>have been banned from Escape from Tarkov in a 21-day window that ended yesterday, August 7. To some, this might look like a huge success, but to those in the know, this is business as usual for Escape from Tarkov, a game utterly plagued by malicious operators.</p>



<p>Recently, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fight against cheaters</a> is ‘hard and never-ending’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eternal-battle">Eternal Battle</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the worst games when it comes to cheaters, and it has been that way for a few years. It’s one of the reasons why the launch of Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform was such a success, as it allows players to get the fundamental Tarkov experience without running into cheaters.</p>



<p>In a document posted on social media, the Battlestate Games team revealed that more than 3,600 cheaters had been banned during a 21-day window spanning July 17 to August 7.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKZ0uxCB5Zi3Q3PsM_Ud4opkrpAeNax6UxrfBJFN0uxLPbcSRJqXCo7BChE7OCQu7jQWLwL8stGYO5/pubhtml?gid=1329899061&amp;single=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at the document</a> reveals some of the key concerns about the cheating epidemic spoiling the most popular extraction shooter ever made. For instance, there are batches of accounts with almost the same name, which indicates that cheaters are running multiple accounts and have plenty of backups to work through.</p>



<p>In a few months, Escape from Tarkov is expected to finally graduate from early access and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a fully released title</a>, but many claim that the game isn’t 1.0-ready, especially as the title is still swarming with cheaters.</p>



<p>It’s one of the biggest hurdles to the game’s success in longevity, and it’s why the peak player counts for the games are believed to be sliding. Recently, Battlestate Games unveiled a rare glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-rare-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s player count</a>, which prompted fans to wonder what portion of that count is represented by cheaters.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-to-rely-on-17-year-old-character-to-drive-pre-orders-for-black-ops-7.1265370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered that Activision’s studios are preparing to rely on the resurgence of a character almost two decades old to drive pre-order volume for Black Ops 7. In a series of posts on social media, the ‘Reznov Challenge Pack’ was unveiled, with dataminers finding a triple pack of skins focused on Victor Reznov, a character first seen in 2008’s World at War.</p>



<p>Reznov has surfaced a few times in the Call of Duty timeline, and his appearance in the pre-order pack for Black Ops 7 comes as little surprise, given how accustomed Activision has been to relying on nostalgia to drive sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reznov-revealed">Reznov Revealed</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, HeyImAlaix revealed the three Reznov skins reportedly coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone when you pre-order Black Ops 7:</p>











<p>This was followed up by a video from realityuk that shows the skins from all perspectives:</p>











<p>The same profile also uploaded shots <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/1953569138560971009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of some pre-order screens</a>, specifically the one that thanks players for pre-ordering Black Ops 7 and immediately unlocking the ‘SOG Reznov Operator’ pack.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many Call of Duty fans lambasted the skins, stressing that the character doesn’t look like the Reznov they know and love. Others were quick to highlight that Activision’s studios did the same thing before Black Ops 6’s release, allowing users to unlock a triple pack of Woods skins for pre-ordering the game:</p>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1953503715945484678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @charlieINTEL</a><p><span>Literally the same pre order rewards as BO6 but instead it’s Reznov. They are relying heavily on nostalgia to keep this game alive😂 </span></p></article></div>







<p>As Battlefield 6 enters a beta period and takes the world by storm, decimating every Call of Duty game, we have to wonder about Activision’s marketing efforts. Is relying on a character revealed almost 20 years ago the best way forward when your chief competitor is bringing so much fresh content to the table?</p>



<p>Nostalgia sells, I guess.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this content is the result of datamining efforts, which means there’s every potential it’ll change or be stripped entirely in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours ago, the Battlefield 6 beta kicked off, and millions of fans have already found their way into the game, <strong>including Insider Gaming’s team</strong>. Unfortunately, the cheaters have also discovered how to bypass the much-discussed Javelin Anti-cheat system set up by Electronic Arts to support the game’s integrity.</p>



<p>On social media, several clips of (alleged) cheaters have surfaced and are being circulated, showing how much of a joke Javelin is to some malicious operators.</p>



<p>Why people feel the need to cheat in a <strong>beta </strong>is beyond me.</p>

<h2 id="h-good-thing">Good Thing?</h2>



<p>It could be argued that cheaters finding their way into Battlefield 6 in the beta is a good thing, as it allows Electronic Arts and all associated studios to firm up their anti-cheat engine ahead of the game’s full launch on October 10.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-to-the-day-we-die-confirmed/">leadership team revealed</a> just how important it is to keep cheaters out of the game, but it’s a never-ending battle that’s constantly evolving.</p>



<p>On social media, clips of cheaters spoiling the Battlefield 6 beta for legitimate players have surfaced:</p>



<div><article><p><span>🚨CONFIRMED: Cheats are already working in Battlefield 6.

This footage proves CHEATS are FULLY FUNCTIONAL on Day 1 of Early Access Beta. </span></p></article></div>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1953553413972877435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @CODUpdates</a><p><span>Just a quick heads up! Forcing players to enable TPM 2.0 and Kernel-level driver anti-cheat system doesn’t prevent hackers/cheaters spoofing and/or use 3rd party cheat software. Believe it or not, it is still happening on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span> 6 Open Beta test!</span></p></article></div>







<p>The beta isn’t perfect, but it’s feeling very polished already. I’ll dismiss the videos of streamers finding map exploits that allow them to hide in the terrain and still attack enemies across the map for now and give the game the benefit of the doubt, but the cheating situation has to be nipped in the bud.</p>



<p>In the days leading up to the Battlefield 6 beta kicking off, fans were wrestling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/">with the SecureBoot topic</a>, with some being actively prevented from booting Battlefield just because they have some kind of third-party application (accessories, lighting, etc) enabled on their PC.</p>



<p>Have you been impacted by a blatant cheater in Battlefield 6? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Nintendo announced it was releasing a new range of Mario-themed products, and while it is marketed towards parents and children, the 'wood block' sets on the way will actually double as amiibo figures.</p>
<p>Along with the news, it's shared multiple photos of this new range made up of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and various items from the Mushroom Kingdom (including Stars, Fire Flowers, and even a music block). We've also got the dimensions, with the Mario block 8cm in height.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Characters such as Mario and Luigi, along with well-known items from the Super Mario series will be available as wooden blocks. These pieces are all made in sizes and weights that are easy for young children to hold and play with. Each character blocks can also be used as an amiibo figure of the relevant character in compatible games."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uigwrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Once again, the small three-piece set will be priced at 2,980 yen and the 30-piece set will cost 19,980 yen (which converts to an eye-watering ~$135 / ~<em>£</em>100 at the time of writing - we'll be <em>very</em> interested to see the US/UK price point on these) – with both releasing in Japan on <strong>26th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This is part of a wider range of Mario products, which will be launching outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. A new Super Mario-themed smartphone and Switch app titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a>' has also been announced and arrives this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play time-traveling strategic RPG Reverse: 1999 just launched its biggest collaboration yet, its first to ever launch simultaneously worldwide, and it teamed up with another time-jumping franchise to do it: Assassin’s Creed. The collab adds new story chapters and popular characters Ezio, Kassandra, and Alexios, all three of whom will be playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reverse: 1999 first launched in 2023 and has seen global success in the time since. It’s been downloaded more than 30 million times worldwide and stands at “very positive” with more than 2,500 reviews on Steam. Those fans have been clamoring for this collab since it was first announced earlier this year, and there’s been particular excitement about the addition of Ezio — as you can see from the 270,000 views and hundreds of comments on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCaA-vcDmQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>his official trailer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the characters and story content might be the headliners of this collab, there’s a lot more to it than that. You can see Assassin’s Creed inspirations in the UI, music, and garments that have been added. Plus, there are free goodies being given away (including Alexios), extra prizes in the gacha system designed to make it easier to pull the new characters, and both online and offline events to celebrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get into the details, shall we?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/offline-events-1754590432413.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Familiar Faces in a Journey Through History</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Reverse: 1999’s story takes you through different eras of history, and that trend continues with this crossover, whose new content will be released in two phases. Phase 1 is live right now and will run until September 18. It adds a story chapter that brings you to Florence, Italy, where you’ll meet the legendary Ezio Auditore da Firenze from Assassin’s Creed II.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS2PNVbI9hs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>collaboration trailer</u></a> hints at how the story of Phase 1 will bring you into contact with Ezio. Mr. APPLe, one of the important characters of Reverse: 1999, is mistaken for a fabled Apple of Eden and must be protected. He’s nearly dissected by Leonardo da Vinci, another character from Assassin’s Creed II who plays a significant role in the Phase 1 story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCaA-vcDmQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Ezio’s character trailer</u></a> shows some of the memories from his journey in Assassin’s Creed II — his assassinations, gathering feathers for his brother, the tragic execution of his family — materializing into different weapons, which references the unique ability he brings into Reverse: 1999. He can wield several different primary and secondary weapons and can swap them out as needed, so he’s always ready for any situation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/ezio-skills-1754588499590.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Like all other 6-star characters, Ezio comes with two garments, the second of which is unlocked after increasing his Insight level. His first garment is the assassins’ classic white robe, and his second (featured in the photo of him above) is the Armor of Altair from Assassin’s Creed II, which was built by and named after the hero of the original Assassin’s Creed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kassandra and Alexios will join in on the fun when the story shifts to Ancient Greece in Phase 2 of the collab, which will run from August 28 to September 18. Like Ezio, Kassandra will get a unique ability designed to make her adaptable: She has three skill trees (Hunter, Warrior, and Assassin) and can switch between them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/kassandra-skills-1754588518136.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the characters and plot, Assassin’s Creed fans will notice other references. The level selection interface adopts the genetic sequence design of the Animus, and music — including the familiar song “Ezio’s Family” — has been pulled from the Assassin’s Creed series. The Into the Shadows mode will let you see the villa in Monteriggioni and complete events in Florence and Venice to experience the Renaissance assassin life like Ezio.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/animus-ui-1754588548609.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dress Up for the Special Collab</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be a Reverse: 1999 update without new garments, and this collab is no exception. Four characters have new garments inspired by Assassin’s Creed and Greek mythology (pictured below). Hissabeth’s new look is inspired by Medusa, the famous snake-haired Gorgon from Greek myth who put up a hell of a fight in Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. The art showing off her new garment shows her dancing between Medusa’s two sisters frozen in stone, the crown she wears pays homage to Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey’s Medusa design, and the artifact she’s holding resembles an Apple of Eden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marcus’s new garment draws from the myth of the musician Orpheus, who traveled to the underworld and used his music to convince Hades to let him take back his deceased wife Eurydice, on the condition that he not look back at her until they reached the surface. During their ascension, Orpheus was overcome with doubt and couldn’t help looking back, and Eurydice was taken from him forever. Marcus’s art recalls this moment of legend, as she glances back and offers her hand to guide her fallen friends to the gates of the underworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vila gets a new garment inspired by the Sirens of Homer’s Odyssey who would lure sailors to their deaths with their beautiful song.

                <p>BioShock fans may be understandably curious about the fate of the next game in the series following leaks that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">BioShock 4 failed an internal review</a> and Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore was reportedly ousted by 2K Games as a result. However, Strauss Zelnick--the CEO of 2K Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive--has essentially promised fans that BioShock 4 is still on the way and it won't be canceled.</p><p>"It's going to come out," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That I can say hand on heart, without question ... We don't talk about how long our development cycles are. We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on BioShock because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That's always challenging. We think we're up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless."</p><p>The same report that noted BioShock 4's latest setback also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">a remake of the original BioShock was canceled</a> earlier this year. 2K Games acknowledged the original report and called Cloud Chamber's BioShock 4 "good game," but reiterated its commitment "to delivering a great one."</p><p>There hasn't been a new game in the BioShock series since 2013's BioShock Infinite, and a proposed BioShock movie has also had difficulty breaking out of development. Francis Lawrence is attached to direct BioShock at Netflix, and he recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p><p>As for BioShock creator Ken Levine, his next title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, remains in development at Ghost Story and it will eventually be published by Take-Two. However, a release date for Judas has yet to be announced.</p>

                <p>This year's Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios in California and Universal Orlando in Florida will feature haunted houses devoted to Fallout and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-universal-halloween-horror-nights-teaser-features-some-familiar-faces/1100-6533541/" data-ref-id="1100-6533541">Five Nights At Freddy's</a>--and while both are inspired by video games, both houses will lean into their respective live-action adaptations.</p><p>The theme parks haven't shared any of the footage of this year's HHN houses yet, but the creative team on both coasts has offered a few teasers about what fans can expect to see.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/halloween-horror-nights-houses-fallout-terrifier-five-nights-at-freddys-1236339724/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Universal revealed that Amazon Prime's Fallout series provided the HHN team with 3D models of Walton Goggins' The Ghoul to ensure that masks used in the attraction are identical to his face on the show. Universal Orlando's Lora Sauls also said that a teaser has been filmed, with "one of their characters for us to tease their second season in the house."</p><p>Universal Orlando's Mike Aiello added that the Fallout house will be a montage of different locations from the show and the games, with appearances by Lucy (played by Ella Purnell in the series), The Ghoul, Maximus (played by Aaron Moten in the series), and a 500-pound animatronic bear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPC6syuNU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OWPC6syuNU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking of animatronics, the Five Nights At Freddy's house will feature full-size animatronic recreations of Freddy Fazbear and his pals as created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Universal Hollywood's John Murdy called them "the most complicated animatronic figures that we’ve ever done" for HHN. He added that guests will "see a fully animated Freddy Fazbear performing like he would in the movie or the video game" in a convincing recreation of the pizzeria that serves as the setting for the games and movies. Even the game's famous security room will be a part of the attraction.</p><p>Universal Orlando will kick off the Halloween festivities with Five Nights At Freddy's on August 29, while Universal Studios will wait a little longer and start the FNAF event on September 4. Halloween Horror Nights on both coasts will run until November 2.</p>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it's releasing a new line of Mario-themed products, videos and even an app designed for parents and their children.</p>
<p>The free smart device and Switch app is officially titled '<strong>Hello, Mario!</strong>' and allows kids to interact with Mario's face. Based on the description <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/app/index.html">and footage so far</a>, it looks a bit like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> start menu feature, allowing you to interact with a 3D version of Mario's head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uigwrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This app will be made available for free on both of these platforms on <strong>26th August 2025</strong> and is published by Nintendo. It will require "iOS 15 or Android 6.0 or later" to play.</p>
<p>As for the rest of this "My Mario" line, Nintendo is also releasing two wooden block sets and a 'Hello, Mario!' Board Book. One small but interesting detail about the wooden block sets is that each of the characters can be used as an amiibo figure in "compatible games".</p>

<p>Along with this, it's also got some visual content lined up, including a series of 'It's Me, Mario!' stop-motion short videos.</p>
<p>This will feature Mario showing off "a variety of expressions and movements" with each video approximately one minute in length. These will air for free on the 'My Mario' official website and "other" channels.</p>

<p>Nintendo also has some other products planned such as apparel, general goods and plush toys. This same series is scheduled to be released outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. This news arrives ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary celebrations this September.</p>

<p>Patents don't always lead to something, but it's still interesting to see what companies might be up to or at least thinking about behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In the case of Switch 2, Nintendo has already delivered some unique features like Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, and now a few other ideas have seemingly surfaced. This information comes from the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lvtbv7atlk2l">via Nintendo Patents Watch on social media</a>), which highlights attachments for a "crank" and what's described as a "clickable wheel".</p>
<p>The crank has a "rotary disc which is tracked by the mouse sensor through a window", with two magnets securing the attachment. According to the same source, the "clickable wheel" rotation is tracked by the mouse sensor via a gear train and "its click is transmitted to the SL button". This attachment also includes a second button to press the SR button.</p>

<p>As for what this could lead to...one obvious guess is some sort of fishing-like accessory and game. Some other suggestions online are joking about Nintendo channelling the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/playdate-picking-things-up-where-the-game-boy-left-off?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Playdate's crank</a>. If we do see anything come of this, or get more information about what might be going on here, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has flat out said that fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-isnt-considering-the-sims-5-right-now-because-its-not-player-friendly-to-expect-fans-to-give-up-all-of-the-content-that-youve-purchased-over-the-years">shouldn't expect The Sims 5 anytime soon</a>. But if you're looking for a new release from the franchise, you'll be happy to know a new Sims game actually did just come out July. Did you somehow miss this momentous news? I certainly did, and that's because it's actually just a board game. The Sims Board Game arrived at Target on July 20, 2025 and it seems to have gone largely unnoticed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which makes a lot of since to me. It's been a long time since I've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-the-sims-4-for-free">played The Sims 4</a>, but having spent a decent amount of time in that game I can't really conceptualize how it would effectively transition to a tabletop experience. The board game itself is a collaboration with Goliath that was <a href="https://toybook.com/goliath-toy-fair-the-sims/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced back in February</a> and garnered a bit of news coverage from various gaming outlets, but now that it's available to buy nobody seems to be talking about it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Sims Board Game Is Now Available</h2><div catalogid="cdfb0e74-d1e7-4aeb-ae61-69db2d44034c" id="226620"><div id="226620" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Sims Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I have no plans on ever purchasing or playing this game, but for the sake of this article I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJRd7kETJg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watched the official how to play video</a> recently published on the Goliath YouTube channel. It's about five and a half minutes long and after sitting through the whole thing, I'm still not sure how to categorize this game or even how to actually play it. The gameplay and rules seem unnecessarily confusing despite the narrator suggesting just "tossing out the rulebook" early on in the video. The main theme of the game is that each player tries to earn points by completing aspirations and various actions throughout play. The first player to eight points wins, with the bonus option of playing to 10 points instead to make the game longer.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/81xkkoo1k2l-ac-sl1500-1754608096208.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The full set up</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As confusing as the gameplay seems, what turns me off to this game the most about this game is that it's meant for 2-5 players. That immediately removes the thing about playing The Sims I enjoyed the most: That I got to do it by myself. Introducing one or more players into the experience seems like a recipe for disaster. It's being marketed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a>, but I could never imagine trying to play this with my actual family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it initially launched at Target, The Sims Board Game is currently available to preorder from Amazon with an August 15 release date. If you feel like giving it a try, it is actually pretty reasonably priced at $19.99.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 7, 2025 11:18 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-board-game-nobody-asked-for-was-quietly-released-at-target-last-month]]></content:encoded>

                <p>No backdoors, no kill switches, no spyware. That's Nvidia's pledge after an accusation from the Cyberspace Administration of China, which asked Nvidia last week to provide documents about security vulnerabilities in Nvidia's H20 data center GPUs, specifically citing "backdoor" security risks. Nvidia responded officially <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/no-backdoors-no-kill-switches-no-spyware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with a blog post</a> the company's chief security officer, David Reber Jr.</p><p>"Embedding backdoors and kill switches into chips would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors," Reber wrote. "It would undermine global data infrastructure and fracture trust in U.S. technology. Established law wisely requires companies to fix vulnerabilities--not create them."</p><p>The Cyberspace Administration of China's concerns stem specifically from the Nvidia's H20 GPU, which is made for the Chinese market and designed to comply with US export guidelines. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/nvidia-blasts-proposals-for-chip-backdoors-as-us-considers-kill-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica notes</a> that U.S. lawmakers are considering a Chip Security Act that would "require exported chips to be built with 'location verification,'" and "calls for an assessment of mechanisms to stop unauthorized use." In other words, a kill switch.</p><p>If you've watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lockpickinglawyer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lockpicking Lawyer</a> on YouTube for even a couple of minutes, you know there's no such thing as a lock that can't be picked--just ones that require more specialized tools. The same goes for hardware backdoors. Once there's a door there, someone will find a way to walk through it. Something as ubiquitous as Nvidia GPUs, which populate data centers and consumer PCs all over the world, makes for an especially appealing target.</p><p>Reber cites the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip#Technical_vulnerabilities" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clipper Chip Debacle</a>," in which the NSA and U.S. government pushed for a chip to be installed in telecommunications devices that would allow backdoor access through an encrypted key. Launched in 1993, security experts found multiple vulnerabilities in the next couple of years, and the chip fell out of favor before it was ever adopted.</p><p>"Security researchers discovered fundamental flaws in the system that could allow malicious parties to tamper with the software," and "that created central vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries." In other words, this kind of backdoor access might give the U.S. government access to GPUs, but it would also give other governments and other malicious actors access as well, with some effort.</p><p>"Some point to smartphone features like 'find my phone'... as models for a GPU kill switch," Reber continued, explaining that those are user-controlled software options. "Hardwiring a kill switch is something entirely different: a permanent flaw beyond user control, and an open invitation to disaster... That's not sound policy. It's an overreaction that would irreparably harm America's economic and national security interests."</p><p>"For decades, policymakers have championed industry’s efforts to create secure, trustworthy hardware," Reber wrote. "Governments have many tools to protect nations, consumers and the economy. Deliberately weakening critical infrastructure should never be one of them."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up this morning to a surprise: my colleague Riley MacLeod, having seen my excited social media posts yesterday (I got a new PC!),<a href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> had written a whole blog post about how I keep my PC on the floor</a>.<br></p><p>In a 600-word piece that is more an indictment on New York City than a commentary on my PC or its placement, Riley worries about two main factors potentially affecting my new purchase: cockroaches and dust,<a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> citing a 2018 Kotaku blog about roaches getting inside a PlayStation 4</a>.</p><p>I don't know how to tell you this Riley, aside from pointing at this company's needlessly complicated ownership and taxation situation thanks to its international composition, but I don't live in New York City, and this is not a PlayStation 4. I live in a <a href="https://region.com.au/canberrans-shiver-through-a-record-breaking-june-with-more-chilly-days-on-the-way/882396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cold</a>, dry, Australian city that doesn't have a cockroach problem, and I live in a house where I vacuum the floor and keep a clean office. My last PC, which was kept in the exact same spot, only had to be properly dusted out <em>once </em>in its five-year lifespan. And it also had a glass side panel, meaning I could be kept very much up-to-speed on its dust situation!</p><p>Besides, leaving all that peripheral stuff aside...how the fuck am I supposed to keep this thing on my desk? It's huge, and would take up like 1/3 of my desk's usable free space, space I need for actual desk items like microphones, speakers, headphones, a mouse pad and my keyboard. It's also heavy, and even with its fancy case and modern fans, surprisingly noisy once you get really close to it. Which I would be if I sat it on my desk, right next to my <em>head</em>.</p><p>Riley ended his blog charitably, in a 'just asking questions' kinda way, asking people for their opinions on the matter. As someone for whom this wasn't even a question, not even the remotest possibility, something that never even once entered into my head when plugging it in, I'll do no such thing; if you keep your PC on your desk the only question I'll ask is <em>is everything OK?</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

                <p>There's been a lot of speculation about the cost of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with some companies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">hoping that it will debut at $100</a> to open the door for more games to drop at that price. The current ceiling for gaming prices appears to be $80, but Strauss Zelnick--the CEO of Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive--doesn't seem to be very enthusiastic about raising the price for GTA 6.</p><p>"I think our approach may be a little bit different," replied Zelnick when asked about pricing GTA 6 at $80 during Take-Two's August 7 investor call. "We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>"Variable pricing has been the nature of this industry forever," added Zelnick. "You know, most Frontline releases will go out at a higher price, sometimes with special editions, and then over time usually the price is discounted to optimize for the largest possible market. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon ... The rubric that informs us is really that of delivering more value than what we charge."</p><p>Earlier this week, Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott laid out a similar argument about why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">it's a bad idea to launch GTA 6 at $100</a>. Elliot suggests that GTA Online is the real cash cow for the franchise, and Rockstar can't risk alienating the players who have stayed with the game for well over a decade now. He also noted that a higher price point raises the risk of players sticking with GTA 5 over its much-anticipated sequel.</p><p>In other GTA news, former Rockstar employee--and longtime in-game DJ--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-unlikely-to-feature-this-longtime-in-game-radio-host/1100-6533727/" data-ref-id="1100-6533727">Lazlow Jones recently revealed he's unlikely to return for GTA 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">real-world musicians may still have a few radio stations of their own</a> in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>
