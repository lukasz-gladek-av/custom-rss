            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Hopefully, many of you are enjoying an end-of-year break over the holidays, but even if you're back at the coalface before the new year arrives, we recommend making time to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvpRGibFhg">this fascinating new overview documentary</a> of the NES' US launch from Frank Cifaldi and the folks over at the Video Game History Foundation.</p>
<p>Building on his years of research, and following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA">the excellent panel</a> at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in October (featuring NOA veterans Gail Tilden, Lance Barr, and Bruce Lowry - we'll embed the archived video at the bottom of the page), this new 45-minute video went live on Christmas Day and explores the ins and outs of the Famicom's journey to the US, its transformation into the Nintendo Entertainment System, and how its New York test market launch set the system up for monster success in the second half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cifaldi presents a condensed timeline of events, bringing together materials from the VGHF's archive with other sources for a brilliant, fresh look at a story you may think you know well. Starting when an initial deal with Atari fell through, which led to Minoru Arakawa and his Nintendo of America team wondering if they themselves had the means and wherewithal to bring the system to the US, Cifaldi highlights discouraging feedback from various rounds of focus group testing and advice, which NOA thankfully ignored.</p>
<p>Nintendo fans may believe there's nothing new to say about this much-told story, but the VGHF team does a great job of working in new tidbits and putting the record straight on points you <em>think</em> you know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d2cf678c1256a"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2cf678c1256a/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, yes, Lance Barr headed the industrial design for the Westernised Famicom hardware (using Bang &amp; Olufsen's sleek hi-fi gear as inspiration for the shell), but did you know that the thick 'brick' we all know and love — well, we all know it, at least — was actually the work of NCL's engineers riffing on Barr's efforts?</p>
<p>The team at Nintendo's Japanese parent company, worried about dust getting into the slot of a top-loading console, took Barr's sexier, B&amp;O-inspired design (known as the AVS before it became the NES) and bulked it out massively to include the front-loading cart mechanism. Barr himself was disappointed with the resulting 'lunchbox' when it appeared.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>did</em> know that already, you're guaranteed to find new info in the essay. The 45 minutes fly by, it ties up the opening Atari thread beautifully at the end, and we highly recommend settling down with it between now and the new year.</p>
<p>And if you're so inclined, head over to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">gamehistory.org/donate</a> to find the VGHF's Winter Fundraiser and support Frank and the team's excellent work.</p>

<p>It's time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, not really. The massively popular Switch will live on in a way few other Nintendo consoles have done thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility</a>, a host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free upgrades to existing games</a>, and a Switch 2 form factor that keeps everything about the previous console.

<p>However, assuming the games play as advertised and the upscaling doesn't bork 720p games on Switch 2's 1080p screen, then a great many of us will be retiring our trusty console - or donating it to someone else.</p>
<p>After eight long years, it's an emotional time, so we thought we'd take a look back at the system — or <em>systems</em> (the replacements, the Lites, the OLEDs we've added to the family) — that kept us going since 2017, though good and bad, sickness and health, 'til Switch 2 us part.</p>
<p>Let's take one last look at the Switches Nintendo Lifers will be packing away very soon...</p>
<h2>A life Switch-up (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4c77861eeb56e"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c77861eeb56e/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My floor isn't always this messy... — <em><span></span> Image: Alana Hagues / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's weird to think that I almost didn't get a Switch straight away. I felt burned by the Wii U's launch, so I was tentative about picking up another launch-day console. Then I got home from work on 3rd March 2017 and there was my mum, with a shiny new boxed Nintendo Switch and a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. The Switch was my very first 'adult' console — as in, it was the first new console I owned as an adult. And in the eight years since, I've had two OG models, a Lite, and three different OLEDs.</p>
<p>Those Switches have been my rock. I took my OG to two separate E3s. It was my companion for many plane and train rides. The Switch was there through a break-up, buying my first apartment, through the-year-we-don't-talk-about, waiting for me post-therapy. Importantly, my OLED was there for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_party_superstars">Mario Party</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> sessions during my long-distance relationship, and it's here now after my move to America to live with my partner.</p>
<p>We have two OLEDs between us, so while one will probably be tucked away, the other will stay out for now. I can't quite say goodbye to the console just yet. I may reserve a lot of love for older systems, but the Switch is one of my favourites. I'm not sure I would be doing what I do now at Nintendo Life without the Switch. So, thank you, you lovely little tablet, you.</p>
<h2>Man's second-best friend (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6354d090c70ca"><a title="TEDDY" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6354d090c70ca/teddy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"What you doing, Dad?" — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think I've gone through quite as many milestones in life as I have during the Switch's lifespan. Okay, granted, not many console generations have lasted as long as the Switch, but whatever.</p>
<p>Soon after March 2017, I moved into my first house with my then-girlfriend, who became my wife a few years later. We got a dog (Teddy, who some of you will have met in a few Nintendo Direct liveblogs), created a brand-new human, moved into a bigger home, and I started working my dream job here at Nintendo Life. Honestly, I owe the Switch a great deal.</p>
<figure data-uuid="036c05beb3449"><a title="Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/036c05beb3449/switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the 3DS, which wooed me with its excellent custom designs, I've stuck to owning just one of each Switch variant: the OG, the Lite, and the OLED. The original has, until now, festered in the garage after I haphazardly threw it in a box whilst moving house, and unfortunately it no longer charges. A regrettable action on my part.</p>
<p>My Lite has pretty much already gone to my daughter, and while she's still not quite old enough to understand how it all works, it'll be there for her in the coming months and years. As for the OLED, I dunno... I suspect I'll keep it as a kind of backup; something to potentially test out GameShare features in the future, or something. I'm hesitant to let it go.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is... thank you, Switch. Nostalgia keeps the GameCube pretty high up on my list of favourite consoles, but there's no denying that the Switch is probably Nintendo's greatest achievement.</p>
<h2>So long, partner (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9880cdf03ad8f"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9880cdf03ad8f/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, that's how shocked I am that it's almost over — <em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes as a shock to almost everyone that I tell, but I didn't get my first Switch until Christmas 2017. I was in my first year of uni at the time and, unsurprisingly, I didn't have a lot of spare money lying around to be splashing on the latest Zelda machine. And so, I patiently waited until ol' Saint Nick came a-calling, while the lineup grew and grew.</p>
<p>Over the next three years of studying, the console brought some of my happiest memories: Wrapping up Breath of the Wild in my gross student bedroom rather than dwelling on homesickness; pulling an all-nighter with my housemates to finish a collaborative runthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn">Shaq-Fu</a> (of all the games); sweating buckets with pals after a post-exams <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2021">Just Dance</a> party. The Wii was all about giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to play, and the Switch felt like it did it all over again.</p>
<p>That OG model, with its drifting Joy-Con and mysterious scratch on the back, got cashed in shortly after I started here at Nintendo Life and thought it only right to pick up a shiny new OLED to mark the occasion. I've kept this replacement in tip-top condition since, naturally, and will continue to do so long after my Switch 2 arrives.</p>
<p>It's only the threat of recency bias that keeps this wonderful hybrid from the top of my all-time favourite console list (where the DS currently sits), but I can see it sitting in pole position a few years down the line. So long, partner. You've been fantastic.</p>
<h2>An on, off, then fully-back-on-for-the-long-haul relationship (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f73b9ff24354c"><a title="OG Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f73b9ff24354c/og-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, my old mucker, which I haven't cleaned the dust off here for maximum effect. An ancient relic, this piece of early human history is actually my first Nintendo Switch (flanked by its siblings) and it still works. Probably. I'm not going to try it, just in case I release a curse and we have to get Brendan Fraser in (he's expensive since the Oscar).</p>
<p>Back in 2017, my mate got himself a Nintendo Switch and, for one of the first times ever, I decided to hold off a little on a new console launch, playing Breath of the Wild on my trusty Wii U, before finally realising I couldn't deal with the FOMO and capitulating. I then got very bored, very quickly. I'm not quite sure why — hard to remember anything that happened before COVID, innit — but I felt like the Switch wasn't going to be able to pull me away from shinier games on more powerful hardware. What a fool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years and Switch, besides having given me a route — through freelance reviews — into my current full-time job at this lovely place, has easily become my favourite console of all time. So many great games, so many cherished family memories (my sons have grown up on Mario Kart 8 and Zelda, which I think we can all agree is the best start in life), it's been the final proof needed for me, as a (pro) gamer, that graphics, raw horsepower, and all that fancy stuff isn't what makes this medium really tick.</p>
<p>So, having said all of those very nice things, you'd think I'd <em>at least</em> be nice enough to dust it, after everything it's done for me. Why am I such a pig? A question for another time, perhaps.</p>
<h2>Gone with the drift (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c5b492959b006"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5b492959b006/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not sure where the biro across the Capture button on that blue Joy-Con came from — <em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've gone through three Switches in eight years. The first, a launch-day department store pickup, was donated to another family member when the better-battery version came out and I couldn't resist the tiniest of upgrades.</p>
<p>Then, when the OLED launched, I ended up swapping the better-battery one for my <em>original</em> launch-day Switch — the one I'd broken in with BOTW across four glorious weekend coach journeys throughout March '17 — which I've still got in the drawer. It's seen better days, and the rails don't hold the Joy-Con very well anymore (the same goes for my OLED), but it's still going.</p>
<p>I can't say what the future holds for them. It would be a shame for that OLED screen to go unused, but until my kids are older, these will probably stay in the drawer. One thing I <em>won't</em> be sad to see the back of is my drifting Joy-Con. I love the multicoloured lineup, but only two of the six pictured above function properly. Hmph.</p>
<p>But let's not let dodgy Joy-Con colour the memory of a little console that's become a part of the family. As with all family members, there's some crunchy with the smooth, but you wouldn't be without them. Goodnight, sweet Switch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And there we are. We salute these Switches as we commit their tablets to the cupboard.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you be hanging up your S1 Joy-Con completely in a few days? Are you getting a little emotional about bidding this console farewell and getting involved with the new, shiny model? We'd love to hear your journeys with your personal Switches below.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Have Until 2030 to Build a Cyberpunk 2-Ready PC, Polish Analysts Predicts a Late 2030 Release for CDPR’s Estimated $419M Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-cd-projekt-red-2030-polish-firm-predicts/</link>
            <guid>1393786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>

			<p>Other years, it's a quiet period for Strategy and Simulation games, making it difficult to even put together a selection of the best games from the genre. Thankfully, that's not the case with 2025, as there were some excellent strategy and simulation games released this year.</p>



<p>Some of those releases even came from the most popular franchises in the strategy and simulation gaming genre. With that said, here are our picks for the Best Strategy and Simulation Games in 2025. Also, make sure to vote for your pick at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-10-10">Two Point Museum (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/">10/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tpm_tp-website_bg-image_3840x2160.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum. Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Two Point series of simulation and management games has always been about creating fun and engaging environments for players to enjoy. It's not about testing your management skills to the brink or making you stress over how your colony (or in this case, museum) is operating. It's about leaning into chaos and comedic moments that make these games enjoyable.</p>



<p>Two Point Museum is a masterclass of a Two Point game, as it strikes all of those points perfectly without missing a beat. It is a bright, accessible management game that will keep you engaged all through its campaign and even further beyond that with its sandbox mode. It's a wonderful accomplishment and easily one of the year's best strategy and simulation games.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's review puts it, "<em>There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</em>"</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-the-Ivalice-Chronicles.png"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles. Image credit: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is a return of a classic strategy game that fans have been dying for, and it absolutely did not disappoint when it arrived this past September. With the original Final Fantasy Tactics being known as one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series, and one of the best strategic role-playing games ever made, there was a lot of nostalgic weight on its shoulders <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">when it was finally announced</a>.</p>



<p>It kept the story that players loved and gave it a boost with the Enhanced version, adding some solid voice acting with only a few minor changes to the script, though if it's not to your liking, you can always jump back to Classic mode to play nearly the exact same game you would have played back in 1998. Of course, you miss out on the quality of life improvements made in the Enhanced version, but it's the fact that you have the option for both that really matters when it comes to a game so beloved as this.</p>



<p>The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't try to fix what isn't broken with the game's already excellent gameplay and Job system, and on the Enhanced version, lets you dive even deeper than was previously possible, with a bit of added difficulty, while still staying true to a core feature of the original: you can still break the game wide open if you can figure out how.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo put it in his review, "<em>Decades after its original release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles remains the golden standard for tactical role-playing games. Refined with excellent quality-of-life improvements that enhance its already deep gameplay and superb voice acting, the War of the Lions’ story and battles have never felt more engaging. While the modest visual overhaul and missing War of the Lions content may disappoint those seeking a true definitive edition, they are minor issues in an otherwise excellent reimagining.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sid-meier-s-civilization-vii-8-10">Sid Meier's Civilization VII (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Civilization VII. Image credit: 2K</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the arrival of Civilization VII has been a long time coming. Not as long, of course, seeing as how the last Civilization game arrived in 2016, but nearly a decade between releases is still a long time to wait, especially if you weren't enamoured with the DLCs that came after the full release.</p>



<p>Which is what made the arrival of Civilization VII such an event, and such a divisive one at that. Not everyone has loved the changes made in the latest entry in what is arguably the most popular (or at least well-known) 4X strategy game in the industry. At the time of this writing, it still has a "Mixed" rating for user reviews on Steam. That said, it doesn't fall so far that it's not a good Civilization game, and to still be a good game in a series of filled with excellent games means Civilization is an easy entry in our best strategy and simulation games of the year.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray put it in his review, "<em>Civilization VII is a great game, that's the simple answer. With an improved city-building system, terrain features, and diplomacy, there is much to like in the new release of the three-and-a-half decade old franchise. However, long-time fans of the series will find some of the omissions, such as the ability to turn off victory conditions other than domination, limiting. This, and the rapid nature of the ages, will also leave some feeling that the epic nature of some longer games is altogether missing. Still, even with the games feeling a little rushed, the one-more-turn that makes Civilization one of the best series ever remains there.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tempest-rising">Tempest Rising</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tempest-Rising.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tempest Rising. Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tempest Rising might just be Command &amp; Conquer with a bit of different paint, but that's not really something worth complaining about when Command &amp; Conquer is nowhere to be seen. Developer Slipgate Ironworks saw a gap in the RTS world, and while it didn't fill it entirely with everything Tempest Rising does, it went far enough to scratch the itch for C&amp;C fans that hasn't been scratched for a long time.</p>



<p>Though its multiplayer didn't launch with a lot of fanfare, and its story mode isn't able to reach some of the C&amp;C iconic highs of the series, Tempest Rising doesn't try to fix a system that isn't broken and still delivers the fast-paced RTS gameplay that kept C&amp;C fans engaged for over three decades. </p>



<p>It's more than a good time for RTS fans and a can-not-miss game for anyone still waiting for a new C&amp;C.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mount-and-Blade-II-Bannerlord-War-Sails-Interview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails. Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord had already established itself as one of the premier cinematic options for medieval gameplay and warfare simulation and strategy, with a solid campaign and a wonderfully built world since its 1.0 release in 2022. Now, five years after its initial release, TaleWorlds Entertainment has expanded on the game with its largest and most significant update yet, a naval expansion.</p>



<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the addition of War Sails changed the game for Mount &amp; Blade II. On top of changes to the map and to the layout of Caladria, adding a new battlefield that also adds new trade routes and ways for players to expand their empire has made an already strong game an even more complete offering.</p>



<p>As I said in my impressions of the expansion and the game when it arrived, "<em>War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-is-offloading-its-soundbar-with-a-bass-reflex-speaker-at-its-lowest-price-as-clearance-extends-beyond-headphones-2000655858</link>
            <guid>1393774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker is a low-profile bar-style soundbar intended to enhance TV audio by adding clarity and punch without taking up too much space on your media stand. This compact unit features a 2.0-channel system with a built-in tweeter and Bass Reflex design, which helps voices sound clearer and adds weight to sound effects, unlike the thin speakers most televisions are equipped with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">Get the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker for a discounted price of just $99, down from $160, saving you $62 and 38% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A minimalistic way to add booming bass to your favorite content</h2>
<p>The sound characteristics of the S100F are optimized for better clarity of dialogue and more immersive TV experience. The 2.0 channel configuration, along with the built-in tweeter, provides crispness to high frequencies, while the Bass Reflex speaker provides more presence to lower-frequency sounds such as crowd noise, low rumbles, and music. Additionally, Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround processing attempts to create a wider sound area than the actual width of the bar itself, creating a more immersive experience for movies and television shows using only a single piece of equipment. There is also a voice enhancement feature that can increase dialogue levels during quiet scenes or loud soundtracks, making it easier to follow conversations without constantly adjusting the volume.</p>
<p>Physically, the S100F was designed to be placed in tight spaces. The soundbar sits relatively low, allowing it to be mounted below the bottom of many TV screens. If you prefer a clean appearance, the soundbar is wall-mountable. It comes with a template in the box that lets you accurately measure and mount the soundbar under a wall-mounted television with less trial-and-error.</p>



<p>The S100F includes simple-to-set-up connections. For example, HDMI ARC allows you to send audio from compatible televisions and also enables you to perform basic control functions via your television remote. Optical input allows you to connect older televisions to the S100F, and USB playback lets you insert a music-filled drive into the soundbar. Finally, there is Bluetooth support that converts the soundbar into a wireless speaker for your phone, tablet, or laptop when the screen is off.</p>
<p>The accessories and other small details included with the product make it seem ready to go right out of the box. In addition to the soundbar itself, you will receive a remote controller with batteries, an optical cable, an AC power cord, a wall-mount template, and installation guides and warranty documentation.</p>
<p>So, if you need a compact soundbar that improves dialogue clarity, adds a deeper bass response due to the Bass Reflex design, and includes both HDMI ARC and Bluetooth connectivity,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/"> the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker available for purchase today at a reduced price of $99 versus the original MSRP of $160, is an obvious choice over standard TV audio.</a></p>

              <p>Honestly, at this point, it’s almost expected for any given MrBeast-based event to generate controversy, misery, and bullying. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the creator’s latest video, a <em>Minecraft</em>-based contest in which 500 men were pitted against 500 women, has resulted in accusations of cheating, sabotage, and transphobia.</p> <p>The video, which has already seen nearly 13 million views on Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast Gaming channel, was poorly organized from the start. Rather than recruiting players deliberately, the event accepted the first 500 men and 500 women who tried to join a server when it went live, naturally resulting in a chaotic selection. It also, according to <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">one person who claimed to have taken part</a>&nbsp;(thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mrbeast-minecraft-boy-girl-competition-scandal/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>), meant many of the women players were very obviously “Russian guys [using] AI images/deepfakes.”</p>

  <p>The purpose of the event, which was recorded over a week of three- to six-hour daily sessions, was to see which team would prevail in what the video claimed to be a simulation of “civilization.” You know, that type of civilization in which men and women live entirely separately, and are pitched against one another based on…their…um…for fuck’s sake.</p>

 <p>Of course, this being a MrBeast event, the whole thing was structured around requiring players to inevitably turn on each other. The side with the most players left after the week would share $50,000 between them, so it created the sophomoric dilemma of wanting to eliminate as many people on your team as you can, while still having more than the other side, and enough to win a war that was due to happen toward the end of the event.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655930">© MrBeast Gaming / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In case there were any pretense at this being anything other than a retrograde endeavor, the whole thing was presented with every cliche in place. The video’s title card shows men in blue diamond armor, and <del>women</del> a woman in a pink dress, with the word “PEACE” above the pink lady side, and “WAR” over the legion of armed men. (Oh, and dividing the two is the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/gurning">gurning</a> face of James “MrBeast” Donaldson himself, despite this being a co-production with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3KMM3QLVEfnFPI8AbLUJA">ish</a>.) Men are then presented as battling one another, fighting for dominance, while women are “making sure” others don’t get more attention, and “turning on each other.”</p>

 <p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">We had thousands of players try to join our first large scale, multi day, competition civilization event in a first come first serve basis,” says the video’s introduction without a single hyphen, and without ever going on to state what was intended to happen as a result. Instead, the bulk of the description is devoted to mitigating the enormous amount of cheating and bad play that took part, reading,</span></span></p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">If a player broke the rules they agreed to in any way or lied on their application about any information to try and sabotage other players, they were banned by the staff who were monitoring 24/7 after an investigation, their actions were reversed and players they killed were revived, and they were replaced with the next boy or girl in line who had tried to join the server earlier in chronological order.”</span></span></p></blockquote> <p>Zavvy, <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">who claims on X</a> to have been one of the participants, gave a damning report of the week-long event. Their first accusation is that Russian men were infiltrating the women’s team, then “mass murdering every girl they could see. This went on for irl DAYS.” They claim the same players also left signs around the map with sexist messages and images of swastikas.</p>

 <p>Despite the protestations in the video description, Zavvy claims that another player on the women’s team identified who many of these infiltrating players were, but was then unable to do anything about it until pressuring staff into adding a way to report them on the event’s Discord.</p> <p>The women’s team, naturally, featured trans women players, but after word got about about the trolling male players, Zavvy says that “a lot of girls began reporting/targeting our trans girlies as infiltrators just because of the pitches of their voices and it started this huge fight on the girls’ side about transphobia and such.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was in this event. Please keep in mind that we only had like 3-6 hours of server time each day.</p> <p>"The girls' side fell apart for SOME REASON"</p> <p>1. We unironically had Russian guys use AI images/deepfakes to cheat their way onto the girls' side and then just start mass murdering… <a href="https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA">https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA</a></p> <p>— Zavvy 💜🎮 (@ZavvyGamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Despite ostensibly being an event about building “civilizations,” it soon became far more of a PvP event. I was unfortunate enough to overhear an awful lot of the 52-minute video as my son watched it, and the narration from both Donaldson and ish feigned bemusement at why the women were “turning on each other,” when it seems the reasons were widely reported and known. Zavvy also claims that the event had so much trouble filling the women’s team (and no wonder, good grief) that the Discord link was spread far and wide to try to reach the 500-player target. This resulted in many players who Zavvy says “didn’t even know how to make a crafting table.” The player then posted what they say are screenshots of signs and chat from the event in which abusive messages were posted in Russian.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655927">© Zavvy / X</figcaption></figure> <p>Another person who says they were at the event, Code Mercy, corroborated Zavvy’s claims. As well as agreeing with all the previous claims, they add that players had been told “it was a social experiment to see how boys and girls would survive and thrive,” and given no idea there was to be any PvP.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As someone who was in this event it was so poorly planned. Everything said above is correct. </p> <p>The story told obviously didn’t mention any of this going on. Heck some of the story was wrong anyways. Wrong leaders on girl side. Timing all wrong as I died and things that happened…</p> <p>— Code Mercy (@realcsgomercy) <a href="https://twitter.com/realcsgomercy/status/2005117682991988781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still more <a href="https://x.com/XxMakio/status/2005122741523878265">players chimed in</a> to <a href="https://x.com/GGoobere/status/2005106728699134417">back up all the same claims</a>, contradicting the narrative presented in the video. The video, instead, included scripted, tiresomely obvious tropes of a stunningly organized women’s side, and a disloyal, fractured men’s side, all so this could be stunningly reversed later in the event.</p>

 <p><span>Of course, any video of this nature is—like reality TV—going to carve storylines from dozens of hours of footage across hundreds of different situations that don’t accurately reflect events. It’s inevitable, justified by the excuse that it makes for a better viewing experience. The issue is that it’s not a depiction of what actually happened, and when you’re a participant who is aware how poorly events are represented, and the genuinely serious issues that are written out of existence, speaking up is often the only way the truth gets heard.</span></p> <p><span>Given</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ava-kris-tyson-mr-beast-grooming-allegations-1851606782"> <span>MrBeast’s own history with issues relating to transphobia</span></a><span>, it’s perhaps no surprise that the video didn’t want to portray the awful situation of trans women being hounded out of the game and the infiltration of bad actors that preceded it, despite its being so core to </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> what happened, happened. Far more fun to say, “Wow, those girls seemed so organized, but then it all turned to in-fighting!!!” right?</span></p> <p>Can we maybe all just move beyond “boys vs girls” as a concept? That’d be good.</p>

<p>The year has come to an end, and if you own a Switch or Switch 2, it is time to look back at all the best games that were released for Nintendo Switch Online in 2025. Nintendo Switch Online is a little different from Game Pass and PS Plus. Instead of providing huge game libraries or Day One releases, NSO provides players with new Classic Games from previous Nintendo platforms each month.</p>



<p>With the base Nintendo Switch Online membership, players get online play, cloud saves, and access to NES, SNES, and Game Boy titles. If players choose the Expansion Pack, they get access to Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. Players also get access to paid DLC for some games, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Witcher 3 DLC Would Make The Wait For Witcher 4 Slightly More Bearable]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-ciri-geralt-sequel-cdpr-2000655922</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Leaks and analyst forecasts have fans buzzing about the possible hope for one last unexpected content update to <em>The Witcher 3</em>. <em>Helldivers 2</em> will continue to evolve in wild ways. And an older mobile JRPG that spawned two great console spin-offs is finally coming to PC in the West next year. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>There’s only a few days left to go in 2025 and I will be spending at least one of those cleaning my PS5. It shut off from overheating three times during my <em>Nightreign</em> run last night. The Everdark Balancers had nothing on the giant dust bunnies roaming around inside my console.</p>

 <h2>Rumors keep swirling about new <em>Witcher 3</em> DLC</h2> <p>Polish leaker Borys Nieśpielak first claimed back <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/dlc-game-awards">over the summer</a> that the decade-old game would get more content, adding earlier this month that he expected some sort of tease at the Game Awards. We didn’t get one, but that hasn’t put the rumors to bed. Now Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is forecasting a new DLC as well.</p>

 <p>“We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for <em>The Witcher 3</em> to be released in May 2026. We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million,” he <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">wrote in a memo</a> earlier this month according to a Google translation (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-3-dlc-expected-in-early-2026-to-set-up-the-witcher-4-3297731/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). “The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.”</p>

 <p>That seems both hard to believe and not completely unthinkable. The only known update CD Projekt Red is currently working on for the 2015 open-world RPG is mod support for the console version. A new content add-on, however small, would no doubt <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-sales-witcher-4-cdpr-2000647747">help boost sales</a> of the current-gen version as the studio works on getting <em>The Witcher 4</em> done. The sequel still sounds so far out <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">it might be a PS6 game</a>.</p>

 <h2>The original <em>Granblue Fantasy</em> is finally coming to Steam over a decade later</h2>  <p>The 2014 mobile RPG behind spin-offs <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em> and <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> will be available for the first time in the West on PC starting March 10, 2026. It’s a turn-based game with summons, classes, and multiplayer raids that includes contributions from ex-<em>Final Fantasy</em> composer&nbsp;Nobuo Uematsu&nbsp;and&nbsp;art director Hideo Minaba.</p>

 <h2>Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming program expands its monthly caps</h2> <p>A 100-hour monthly limit used to only apply to new subscribers. Now it will apply to everyone, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-geforce-nows-time-limit-will-stop-gamers-after-100-hours-each-month"><em>PCMag</em> reports</a>. GeForce Now users will have to pay an extra fee each month to continue streaming games beyond that. The price will be $3 for 15 more hours on the performance plan ($10 a month) and $6 for 15 more hours on the Ultimate plan ($20 a month). The move suggests Nvidia will continue looking to crack down on costs as the program grows.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> could get “sequel-level” features like eight-player missions</h2> <p>“There’s quite a lot of [new features] actually and I think the community is pretty good at picking up where they sort of want the game to head when you consider sort of the sequel-esque approach to it,” creative director Johan Pilestedt said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QokA_oAk4ig">recent Arrow Game Studios livestream</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-cco-would-rather-add-sequel-level-features-like-8-player-missions-and-bigger-open-world-maps-than-outright-make-helldivers-3/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>).&nbsp;“Eight-player missions would be one of those,” he continued. “Larger open-world maps where you maybe come across other Helldiver teams to then take on bigger challenges together. Operations that affect other teams, as well, would be those kind of level of features.”</p> <div> <h2>Will we see Arkane’s<em> Blade</em> game in 2026?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is hard at work, everyone is super proud and out doing themselves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publishers MangaGamer and Kagura Games have announced that they've teamed up with developer AliceSoft to bring the legendary eroge series <em>Rance </em>to Steam.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/rance-is-finally-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the Kagura Games website, the studio confirms that it'll be releasing a number of <em>Rance </em>games on Steam, although there seems to be a bit of a question mark hanging over exactly which <em>Rance </em>titles will be available on Valve's platform.</p><p>Kagura says it's bringing the following <em>Rance </em>games to Steam: <em>Rance 01 + 02 </em>(as a package), <em>Rance 03</em>, <em>Rance IX</em>, <em>Rance X</em>, <em>Rance Quest Magnum</em>, <em>Rance IV</em>, and <em>Sengoku Rance</em>. The presence of <em>Rance IV </em>on this list is a little strange, however, given that the game doesn't appear to be available anywhere else in an official English translation.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The <em>Rance </em>games are coming to Steam.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's possible that <em>Rance IV</em>'s inclusion is a typo; after all, a quick <em>Rance </em><a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/?s=rance+&amp;post_type=product" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">search</a> on the official Kagura Games website turns up a listing for <em>Rance VI + 5D</em>, and MangaGamer's <a href="https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/product_list.php?opt=search&amp;page=1&amp;goods_type=1&amp;keyword=Rance" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">site</a> also lists <em>VI + 5D </em>for sale. What's more, the new trailer advertising the series' Steam release shows clips from <em>Rance VI + 5D</em> rather than <em>IV</em>.</p><p>However, the head of the AliceSoft Discord channel insists that the listing isn't a typo, so it's also possible that <em>Rance IV </em>will be getting its first official localization as part of this swathe of re-releases. Either way, <em>Rance </em>fans are eating pretty well right now, it seems.</p><p>Given Valve's eagerness to remove adult-oriented content from Steam, even when said content's themes seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">directly explore adult subjects</a> in an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artistic rather than exploitative way</a>, it seems strange that the <em>Rance </em>series' re-release has made it through the company's approval process.</p><p>In the past, however, Kagura has released other AliceSoft eroge titles with a patch to remove censorship available through the publisher's official website, so it's possible that this is how the <em>Rance </em>series will work as well.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see exactly what Kagura and MangaGamer have in store for <em>Rance</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-no-margin-on-16-1%e2%80%b3-portable-gaming-monitor-to-offload-best-selling-stock-2000655767</link>
            <guid>1393732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How can you improve your productivity when you’re on the go? A second monitor can do the trick. But don’t just go plunk down cash on the first thing you see out there. Not when you can save some money instead.</p>
<p>If you want to bring home a portable monitor that combines portability with use as a gaming, streaming and/or multi-tasking device, the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor is the answer. And right now, it’s on sale for what you might think is a pretty reasonable price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">You can order the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor on Amazon for just $96.99, which is $33 less than its original list price of $129.99.</a> That’s a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable monitor perfect for gaming and productivity</h2>
<p>Though this is a somewhat budget-priced screen, the screen is still quite sharp and vivid. It has a rapid 144Hz refresh rate so movement in video games and movies appears more smoothly than you might get with traditional 60Hz screens.</p>
<p>The increased smoothness can give you a competitive advantage in certain gaming genres like racing games, first person shooters, and other fast-paced titles. In addition, the monitor’s heightened response rate can let you scroll through pages online and take care of most of your daily tasks even faster than usual.</p>
<p>In terms of keeping busiy on the go, this portable monitor was created to be taken with you when you travel. It’s super light so you can easily carry it to another location, and it’s designed to be used in many different types of environments like as a friend’s house, travel, or a coffee shop where you’d like to set up a second monitor. It connects to devices like your laptop, Nintendo Switch, handheld gaming consoles, and other phones that are capable of displaying images on an external monitor. All you have to do is connect a cable without extensive setup. And you’re good to go.</p>



<p>The build quality of the ARZOPA portable gaming monitor is pretty sturdy for the price, too. The included stand folds out so you can place it at a viewing angle that fits comfortably on your desk or tabletop. Therefore, you can adjust the viewing position of the screen to fit the way your desk is configured, rather than having to awkwardly tilt your laptop screen or stack books underneath it. The thin design of the monitor will help reduce clutter on your desk when it is not being used.</p>
<p>Overall, the high refresh rate, portability, and ease of setup of the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor make it an excellent companion for gaming and productivity. If you don’t want to drag around a second full-size monitor but need more screen real estate than a phone or tablet can provide, this is a great and affordable pick that’ll get you together.</p>

              <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>seems to be largely playing the hits, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>bringing back Chris Evans as the should’ve-been-retired Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, casting Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom after he’d seemingly retired from the Marvel Cinematic Universe with </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span>, and wrangling a slew of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>X-Men from the Fox movies</span></a><span>. Those characters, such as Patrick Stewart’s Professor X and Ian McKellen’s Magneto, are the subject of the latest theater-exclusive </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>trailers </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-avatar-fire-ash-teasers-steve-doom-2000654609"><span>playing in front of </span><i><span>Avatar: Fire and Ash</span></i></a><span>, and while it doesn’t beat the “fanservice nostalgia slop” allegations, it is a reminder that I am a mark first and a hater second because those are my superhero peepaws.</span></p> <p><span>Shaky camera recordings from inside theaters have been uploaded on social media and taken down by Marvel almost immediately after. If you search for it on places like YouTube and X, you’ll probably stumble into a few AI mock-ups of them as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>slop content creators take advantage of the moment</span></a><span>.

 <p><span>The two hold hands with the passion and tenderness of decades-long friends-to-enemies-to-lovers as Magneto talks about the inevitability of death, but then this moment of homoeroticism is interrupted by two shots of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>Donut Lord himself</span></a><span> James Marsden finally returning to the role of Cyclops for the first time since his brief cameo in 2014’s </span><i><span>X-Men: Days of Future Past</span></i><span>.

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Action Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/game-of-the-year-2025-best-action-game/</link>
            <guid>1393702</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In an era of hyper-specific genre blends and mashups – take the roguelike city-building bullet heaven of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/monsters-are-coming-rock-and-road-review/">Monsters Are Coming!</a>, for example – it’s always felt daft just how many games can end up lumped in with the Action Adventure label. Don’t pretty much all games feature action? Are you not always going off on an adventure?</p>
<p>Well, yes, but let’s peel that back a little further to just Action for the time being, where you can arguably focus more on the core gameplay, the responsiveness of the world that makes these games satisfying to play in the first place.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch’s sequel to its celebrated samurai sim evolves the open world action game formula that made Ghost of Tsushima such a hit. This is mainly thanks to the beefed up arsenal of vengeful protagonist, Atsu, allowing players to employ <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei’s</a> five melee weapons, pick off enemies from afar using ranged attacks, or quietly eliminate them without leaving a trace. Being able to seamlessly switch between these playstyles turns every encounter into its own unique encounter, supercharged by intuitive traversal mechanics and a core combat system that is easy to pick up though constantly rewards experimentation.</p>
<p>What really sells Ghost of Yotei is its approach to open world design. Where other game maps feel overwhelming, bloated, and artificially padded out with repetitive tasks, Ezo feels like more of a curated space where side mission, bounty, and activity has meaning. In other words, five years after the original game, Ghost of Yotei has been well worth the wait.</p>

<p><em>– Jim</em></p>
<h3>Ninja Gaiden 4 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>You know that bit from the movie Ratatouille where the mean food critic takes a bite of food so nostalgic and decadent that it makes him flash back to eating a beautiful meal at home as a kid? That’s the kind of experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/ninja-gaiden-4-review/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is. It’s a fully confident return to the fast, frenetic, flashy action gameplay that ruled the early 2000s gaming landscape. While so many modern games default to the slower and more methodical Souls-style combat, Ninja Gaiden 4 dares to ask “what if your parry button was also your attack button and you fought a twelve foot tall robot samurai within the first hour of the game?”</p>
<p>It’s an incredible experience that manages to feel like a perfect blend of the methodology of the original Ninja Gaiden games and the style of Platinum Games’ finest releases. You’ve got an overwhelming amount of weapons, tools, combos, specific inputs, and special abilities to chain together at your leisure. At the same time, you’ve got face-melting rock music, hordes of enemies, and jaw-dropping set pieces that keep the experience moving at a million miles a minute. It’s a beautiful achievement in action gaming that I’m desperate to see more of in the future.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Miguel</em></p>
<h3>Donkey Kong Bananza – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The crash ’em, bash ’em, smash ’em action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was a real surprise to find coming from the team that last made the much more technical and clinical 3D platforming of Super Mario Odyssey, but it’s just another showcase for the creativity and inventiveness that remains a hallmark of Nintendo’s platformers. Bringing DK back to be the star of a 3D platformer once more, Nintendo EPD Tokyo mined for new ways to use his raw power and strength. Literally.</p>
<p>Smashing up the world is a huge part of Donkey Kong Bananza, slapping his way through rocks and scenery to carve new paths through the environment, discover more secrets, and generally reshaping the environment. It’s easy to let yourself descend into a fugue state of just bashing everything in sight, and it can get pretty messy and feel uncontrolled because of it, but there’s still that 3D platforming mastery waiting for you to return to as DK and Pauline descend deeper and deeper to the world’s core and the mythical promise that awaits.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-our-2026-nintendo-and-switch-2-predictions</link>
            <guid>1393699</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e704260b7671"><a title="2026 Predictions 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e704260b7671/2026-predictions-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, it seems like only yesterday we were looking ahead at Nintendo's 2025 with a sense of unwavering optimism, and now here we are – it's certainly been a year. The Switch 2 finally arrived, bringing with it a plethora of goodwill and controversy alike, ushering in a new generation that, if initial sales are anything to go by, might be one of Nintendo's most successful yet.</p>
<p>It's still early days, mind you, but we've no doubt that 2026 is going to be an equally busy year for Nintendo (and for us, too), so it's time we look ahead at the upcoming 12 months and see what might be in store.</p>
<p>Naturally, now that the big hardware release is out of the way, we're going to be focusing mainly on the <em>games</em> here, but we'll also throw a bone to Nintendo's non-gaming business, which seems to be ramping up more and more with each passing year.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:181925 @ 1767026554 -->
<p>So without further ado, let's live right in with a look at first-party Nintendo games...</p>
<h2>Switch 2 First-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e203fb172b109"><a title="2026 Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e203fb172b109/2026-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> I think it's about time we see <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-should-luigis-mansion-4-take-place">Luigi's Mansion 4</a></strong>, wouldn't you agree? It's been over six years since the third game, and given that it's sold nearly 15 million copies at this point, I think a new entry would be an easy win for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Then again, if Luigi's gets the spotlight, does that mean we go <em>another</em> year without a new 3D Mario? I'm not sure how I'd feel about that. I'm confident that Nintendo will reveal at least one of these in the coming months. I'd be equally thrilled with either, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Gosh, despite a new console launching just six months ago, my expectations are relatively low. It'll be busy for third parties, but I think Nintendo will be skipping over its big anniversaries this year (Metroid, Zelda) with little more than a trailer or a remaster.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think we might see something <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> related in 2026, whether that's a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">3</a>, or heck, even that patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">X</a>! And a teaser for a new game would be lovely, too. <strong>Pokémon Gen X</strong> <em>may</em> be on the cards, but with its usual release window hogged by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a>... I mean, the kids can play the 'mon while the parents have a new Rockstar game to get through</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong><strong>:</strong> Okay, let's get this one out right from the jump: we're not getting a Zelda in 2026, 40th anniversary be damned! Hmm, perhaps more accurately, I don't think we're getting a <em>new</em> Zelda in 2026. The next big 2D or 3D joint feels a couple of years away, <em>minimum</em>, so it's remake season, baby! I've given up holding out for that fabled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">Wind Waker</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess HD</a> port, so let's go for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games instead. Just don't touch my beloved Minish Cap.</p>
<p>Otherwise: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC, a new <strong>Pikmin</strong>, and '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> 2'.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm gonna go ahead and suggest we could (or should) be looking at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> action in 2026. And I mean the full smorgasboard of paint-flinging multiplayer mayhem, not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders'</a> solo spin-off. It's been long enough since the superb third entry, and I'd love to see what the new graphical and CPU grunt of S2 could add to the equation.</p>
<p>I also wouldn't be surprised to see something from the vaults, like a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus</a> (one that people universally enjoy controlling) - yeah, that would have me foaming at the mouth, not gonna lie, but there's also plenty of scope for dream level stuff, too. Like a super-charged and graphically glorious return to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, now that Nintendo can go big on the graphics and maybe even deliver slick online options. <em>[Ha! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I imagine we'll see whatever the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program">Playtest</a> turns out to be, but I'm hoping for that new 3D Mario to properly get the pulse racing. And for Zelda's 40th, it's the one we've all been waiting for:, the most ludicrous of NS2 Ed. titles, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Tingle's Toetown Hoedown</strong>.</p>
<p>Followed by <strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Fighters Pass Vol 3+4 <strong>+ Subspace Warpdash</strong> for the holidays. Yes, expanding titulature is a pillar of the Switch 2 generation.</strong></p>
<h2>Switch 2 Third-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f21258eeb1218"><a title="2026 Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f21258eeb1218/2026-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm sure <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is on everyone's card here, as it should be, and I would also love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> make the jump. Otherwise, I'm gonna go ahead and predict that we'll see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> arrive in a solid port that gets grief for being 30fps in handheld. I'd also suggest third-party racing games and sports games will make a much bigger impact now that a Switch console is capable of running them, so I wouldn't be surprised to see something like <strong>Forza</strong> (the next one <em>is</em> set in Japan).</p>
<p>Heck, maybe we might even have a sniff of something like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_galactic_racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wreckfest_2">Wreckfest 2</a> (or a bundle of some sort), or even the next entry in the <strong>F1</strong> series. Much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I want ports-galore! Clair Obscur feels like the most open of open goals right now, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some smaller 2025 hits like Blue Prince and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">PEAK</a> make the jump — the latter with Mouse Mode climbing <em>and</em> GameChat? <em>Oof</em>. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> in there, too.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Starting off safe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will release around six months after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a>, <em>and</em> we'll also see the third part of the trilogy. Maybe not day one Switch 2, but we'll see. Sticking with Square Enix, 2026 marks Dragon Quest's 40th anniversary. Can we really go <em>another</em> year without seeing <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>? I'm not sure, but I think this is the year to reintroduce it to the world.</p>
<p>Going a little leftfield, I really want to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/denshattack">Denshattack!</a> on Switch 2, and when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></a> leaves Early Access, I <em>need</em> a port asap. And with the Yakuza train just continuing to roll, can we please have <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Like a Dragon</a>? I think it'll happen.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love a good port as much as the next sailor, but I'd really like something I <em>haven't</em> already seen at a higher resolution and frame rate elsewhere. But that isn't very useful for a predictions piece, is it?...</p>
<p>Oh, let's say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/rez_infinite">Rez</a>. That's the stuff. And <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/phone/super_hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> at 4K, and with Switch 2's snazzy handheld audio, pulsing, pulsing..., yeah, that's it. C-mon, Tel, don't make me beg. Again.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> represent a clear indication that the Switch 2 is a viable console for so-called 'AAA' third-party games, so as much as I want to see a few ports (yes, Baldur's Gate 3), I'm keen to see completely new games. Neither <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> nor <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/bloodstained_the_scarlet_engagement">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</a> are confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but I'd be very surprised if they skipped Nintendo's console altogether.</p>
<p>Similarly, Capcom seems to be all-in with Nintendo, so it's possible that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/onimusha_way_of_the_sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> also gets a surprise confirmation at some point. Speaking of Capcom, the new <strong>Okami</strong> won't make 2026, but we'll see the first proper trailer and it'll be confirmed for Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Switch Online Additions</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7f3fe5ef02e44"><a title="2026 Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f3fe5ef02e44/2026-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I've been very happy with the GameCube additions to Switch Online so far — a mix of big hitters a weirdo releases. But the biggest one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>, is weirdly absent. It <em>has</em> to happen in 2025, surely? With online functionality, 25 years after its release? What a way to push the Expansion Pack. Otherwise, I'll continue to beg for Pokémon games as long as my life depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_four_swords_adventures">Zelda: Four Swords Adventure</a> coming to a Switch 2 near you, and Mouse Mode feels like a great fit for DS games.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I've got a fancy new GameCube controller for my fancy almost-new Switch 2, and I'd bloody well like to use it, Nintendo. Specifically, I think we'd all have a great time if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/baten_kaitos_eternal_wings_and_the_lost_ocean">Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</a> showed up for NSO. Failing that, I'll take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/billy_hatcher_and_the_giant_egg">Billy Hatcher.</a></p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Honestly, I'd be happy to just see <em>more</em> GameCube titles in 2026. Not just first-party games; let's get a few surprises in there. I'm thinking a Silicon Knights double-whammy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metal_gear_solid_the_twin_snakes">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a>, but I think it's also notable that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a> has yet to see a release on the Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> would be delightful, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> There's a part of me that's convinced Nintendo is working on a second-screen peripheral for that top USB-C port so we can get DS, 3DS and Wii U libraries on Switch 2. It feels like a long shot for 2026 — especially since the Virtual Boy is right around the corner — so I'll throw out my yearly wish for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> games on N64 and GameCube, too.</p>
<h2>What about Switch 1?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d6fe313ad14a3"><a title="2026 Predictions 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fe313ad14a3/2026-predictions-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> The original Switch will get a couple of new announcements beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>. I'll keep bringing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">3</a> until it actually happens, and I think Nintendo would put them on Switch 1, too.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I agree with Ollie here, in that Metroid Prime 2 and 3 could work out really well on S1, and what a send-off that would be, especially if they could pad it out with a few new drops. I'll go ahead and suggest a new Pikmin could hit <em>both</em> Switches, alongside any new Mario.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> There's still life in the Switch 1, what with over 150 million units out there, and I think we'll continue to get games on the console over the next year. Largely, it'll be in the form of updates and patches that cater to both consoles, but we'll see.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I think we'll see more uses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> from Nintendo. They may go back and add that functionality to a couple of games that are missing it, so families that have both consoles can play together. I think that'd be lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Honestly? The upcoming titles that we already know about might be the last of the <em>new</em> S1 releases. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> feel like a particularly cosy note to end on, and I can't see any mega-busters heading to the old hardware now that Switch 2's in full swing.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The new Rhythm Heaven is legitimately the most exciting thing Nintendo has announced so far for 2026. Is there any point in releasing anything else first-party when you've got GOTY 2026 wrapped and bagged?</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> predict that I'll be picking up a bargain-priced Switch Lite for my collection when stores start selling off inventory cheap. But it seems that prices have skipped the end-of-gen dive and just keep going up. Therefore, the pile of unused hardware in the Billy bookcase won't be getting bigger anytime soon. Probably for the best.</p>
<h2>Non-Gaming Nintendo News</h2>
<figure data-uuid="8c1912a0594a7"><a title="2026 Predictions 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c1912a0594a7/2026-predictions-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> The <strong>Mario Galaxy</strong> movie will follow in its predecessor's steps and cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, Nintendo Pictures has at least one more <strong>Pikmin</strong> short up its sleeve, and we'll get confirmation of a <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> TV series. We'll also see at least three new Nintendo mobile apps with near-identical red and white logos.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A <strong>Zelda</strong> movie trailer is a given, right? As we've mentioned above, it's the 40th anniversary. That would be a big enough deal for Nintendo, and it's what the company did for Mario's big bash.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>think</em> is weird, given Ninty's big expansion into multimedia, is that we have no big TV show yet. So I think we're going to get one next year. Kirby? Animal Crossing? <em>A Kid Icarus show?</em> I don't know. But have your remotes ready.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> At this point, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo announces another theme park, or maybe a smattering of new retail stores. The company appears to be really ramping up its visibility to the point of becoming the new Disney, and I'm all for it.</p>
<p>We'll also get <strong>New Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo XL</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I really didn't like the recent Mario movie, but I accept that it's probably not really aimed squarely at me. So, yeah, I guess that's gonna be the big obvious thing next year for Nintendo, another Jack Black video game movie (groan).</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Animal Crossing expansion for one of the theme parks, and an increase in quality merch like the stuff currently hitting My Nintendo Stores. I do like the look of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-reveals-new-line-of-metroid-merch-and-we-want-it-all">those Metroid ice trays</a>.</p>
<h2>Wild Cards!</h2>
<figure data-uuid="b352acbe0ea24"><a title="2026 Predictions 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b352acbe0ea24/2026-predictions-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/hardware_classics_pokemon_mini">Pokémon Mini</a> comes to NSO.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> As images and scientific data related to the interstellar object 3i/Atlas are studied in early 2026, it's discovered that the anomaly, only the third of its kind ever to pass through our galactic neighbourhood, is actually Starship Mario. It's all real.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> So, let's go back to my slight Metroid 40th anniversary dismissal and propose a remake — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. I don't know if I want it, but by goodness, what a way to get people scrambling for joy. And shock. And maybe disappointment?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> <strong>Star Fox</strong>. Yeah, I said it. The dream is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">64</a> remake, natch, but if Nintendo wants to grace us with an all-new entry on a system where people will actually play it, you'll hear no complaints from me. 2026 is the year, I'm telling you!</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> It'll be <strong>Zelda</strong>'s 40th Anniversary in 2026, so Nintendo might surprise us with something special. How about a remake of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">original NES game</a>? Nothing groundbreaking, but maybe something akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a> on the GBA. Keep it top-down with pixel art visuals, streamline it appropriately, and I'd buy it in an instant.</p>

<h2>A reliable mic for content creators and beyond</h2>
<p>Inside the packaging, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, and a charger case to make sure you always have power when you’re on the go. The two transmitters can easily clip onto clothing or sit quietly nearby your subjects to obtain crystal-clear audio without having to lug heavy equipment around.

              <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege </em>suffered a major hack that saw players flooded with billions of dollars worth of in-game credits. As a result, Ubisoft pulled the game and its marketplace offline. Only in the last few hours has it begun allowing players back in.</p> <p>Ubisoft posted to <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808"><em>Rainbow 6</em>‘s official X account</a> on December 27 that it was “aware of an incident” and “working on a resolution.” A couple of hours later another update added, “<span>Siege and the Marketplace have been intentionally shut down while the team focuses on resolving the issue.”</span></p>

 <p>The incident was an apparent attack on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">the&nbsp;<em>R6</em> servers</a> that saw not only billions of in-game money distributed among players, but also super-rare weapon skins landing in some people’s lockers, Renown being handed out like candy, and Alpha Packs showing up in inventories as well. At the same time, some players reported having their in-game finances entirely wiped out.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, there followed an ominous five hours of silence from the Ubisoft team, during which all manner of rumors spread among the game’s community, including that the attack was a cover for stealing all of Ubisoft’s source code (there is no evidence for this), and that anyone who spent the vast amounts of new money they now found in their account would be banned.</p>

 <p>The latter rumor became extremely prevalent across social media and Reddit largely because before the shutdown, an in-game ban ticker had been spamming announcements across players’ screens for huge numbers of bans! When Ubisoft finally updated its X account, it was to make clear this was not true.</p>

 <p>“Nobody will be banned for spending credits received,” said the post, noting “any messages seen were not triggered by us.” But for those thinking Christmas had happened all over again added, “a rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">➡️ Nobody will be banned for spending credits received. A rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.</p> <p>➡️ The ban ticker was turned off in a past update. Any messages seen were not triggered by us.</p> <p>➡️ An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did… <a href="https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O">https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O</a></p> <p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>With the game offline, Ubisoft again went very quiet, this time for 21 hours. (Social media teams: please don’t do this! Even if you have no news, post to say so! Reassure people it’s being worked on. Yes, you’re all in a crazed panic, but someone can write a sentence on X and stave off a <em>vast</em> amount of misinformation and player distress. Have you never had a flight delayed?) Sunday at lunchtime, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005329908105359712">a post appeared</a> explaining that<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> was being rolled back to its pre-hack state followed by “extensive quality control tests” to ensure “the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.” The update continued, seemingly addressing nearly a day’s panic from the <em>R6</em> community,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span>The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Seven hours later, the tests were complete, and a soft launch began, allowing a few players back in to see if anything exploded. Then by last night, <em>Rainbow 6 </em>was re-opened to everyone, with the game’s state rolled back to early Saturday morning. All purchases made, whether legitimate or with the unexpected pirate bounty, were undone, and freebies handed out were removed from accounts. It was also noted that “<span>A small percentage of players may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks.”</span></p>   <p>The Marketplace, however, remains offline “as further investigations continue.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first time&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> has taken a big hit in 2025. Back in June, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/ubisoft-sales-miss-forecasts-as-rainbow-six-siege-glitch-takes-toll-fd2a6519">another glitch involving prepaid cards</a> that saw in-game money inflated cost Ubisoft significant losses, and this holiday attack could do much the same.</p>

 <p>It was, given the scale of the attack, an impressively swift repair, all done and dusted within 48 hours. The only issue, as appears to always be the case in such incidents, was a lack of regular communication with players to quash rumors and disinformation. It does, of course, raise significant questions over the security surrounding&nbsp;<em>R6 Siege X</em>, given that this was possible in the first place. There has been no announcement either way about whether player account information was seen or stolen, but people with accounts might want to change their passwords just in case. There has also been no information about what actually allowed the attack, and whether it can happen again.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the ongoing price increases in RAM due to the rise in AI could delay the next generation of console releases.</p>







<p>We first mentioned the rumor during our Insider Gaming Weekly episode on December 19th, where we mentioned that we had heard that there are already ongoing talks at the high levels on what the RAM availability could mean for the next generation.</p>

<p>From what we’ve heard, the industry as a whole is concerned about RAM availability (as they should be) and what that is going to mean for mass-producing consoles at a competitive price point. Not only for the next generation, but it could also mean that yet more price increases for current generation consoles will hit us in 2026.</p>



<p>RAM modules have increased in price by several hundred percent in the past few months due to the demand for AI, and with the pursuit of AI seemingly not going away anytime soon, RAM availability could continue to be a bottleneck. Or at the very least, the RAM shortage will mean that prices will continue to hike.</p>



<p>It leaves console producers in a very tricky spot moving forward, and while consoles have traditionally been subsidised to a certain extent in the past, it seems like RAM availability and price increases will mean that the next-generation of consoles, which were already believed to be much higher in price than previous generations, could be extortionate.</p>



<p>From what we understand, the situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, therebyallowing prices to drop.</p>







<p>Regardless of what happens, though, it seems that the next couple of years could see the current generation of consoles increase in price further. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When people look back on 2025, they’ll likely find a year that will go down as one of the best for games of the last decade or more. From surprising success stories like Peak and Blue Prince to major AAA blockbusters like Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, there was something for everyone this year. But only one game could claim the title of the Insider Gaming community’s 2025 Game of the Year.</p>



<p>After a two-week voting period in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, the readers voted Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as the Game of the Year.</p>







<p>Released on April 24, 2025, Clair Obscur’s visuals along with the story centered around mortality resonated with players around the world. The game has received near universal acclaim from many, and even walked away with other Game of the Year awards from various events.</p>



<p>The voice acting is some of the best there’s been in years, and even the music can compete with the likes of major motion pictures and games with near billion-dollar budgets. It’s honestly hard to find much to critic about the game, which is why it one with such a large amount of the votes. </p>







<h2 id="h-other-games-received-votes-too">Other Games Received Votes, Too</h2>



<p>While other votes for games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Multiplayer</a> and Indie Game of the Year were close, Game of the Year was one of the more lopsided. Clair Obscur received 27.8% of the votes while the second-place game, ARC Raiders, earned 14.8%. Rounding out the Top 5 were Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (13.9%), Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (12.2%), and Ghost of Yotei (8.7%).</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dying Light: The Beast, Split Fiction, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/anime-style-dating-sim-love-and-deepspace-surpasses-750m/" rel="nofollow ">surpassed $750 million</a> in gross player spending within two years of release.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Love and Deepspace?</h2><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace is a free-to-play otome game available on mobile devices. In case you are new to the genre, the term "otome" refers to narrative-heavy games in which players can romance characters in the game. The game's main story features a sci-fi scenario where the protagonist, known in the game as a hunter, joins an organization that protects the planet from malicious aliens. As you play, the game flits between date scenarios with its swoony men, 3D-action combat challenges, and its overarching story, revealing a depth and wealth of gameplay options.</p><p dir="ltr">At the heart of Love and Deepspace are its five romanceable men: Xavier, Rafayel, Zayne, Sylus, and Caleb. Each has their own personality and fulfills their own archetype. Rayafel is youthful and goofy, whereas Zayne is withholding, but mature. Xavier is protective and calm, whereas Sylus has an almost threatening aura. Depending on how dominant, soft, practical, or creative you like your man, players can spend time with the romantic interest (or interests) that best fit their preferences.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625557" data-ratio="0.56306677658697" data-width="1213" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625557"></a><figcaption>Love in Deepspace.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because Love and Deepspace is a live-service game, its developers are constantly giving players new ways to interact with its cast; this leads to there being loads of minigames and different features contained within it. In the main menus, you can interact with the boys almost as if they're little Tamagotchi pets. It's both easy and encouraged for you to use your phone to poke and prod at them, or even breathe on them by using the microphone. All this, and other features like one that plays AMSR-esque audio of a boy breathily talking to you, create a sense of intimacy and connection with the characters in this world--one that has ultimately helped establish it as the go-to otome game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Why is Love and Deepspace so popular?</h2><p dir="ltr">As is the case with most hit games, a combination of cultural factors and specific qualities about Love and Deepspace have helped contribute to its success. On a practical level, the game is easy to begin playing. All an interested player needs is a smart phone with enough empty storage space and they can get started for free. This low entry barrier ensures that the game can accrue players easily. However, there's more to it than that.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past five or so years, gacha games like Love and Deepspace have grown in popularity stateside thanks to the success of Genshin Impact and similar titles. Growing familiarity with the model of gacha games--and other elements like industry reports that show <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/2024/how-can-gaming-industry-get-more-female-gamers.html" rel="nofollow ">live-service games aimed at women and femmes</a> are an underserved market --have buoyed its overall popularity. Then, you need to think about the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">With Love and Deepspace, Papergames has proven it is possible to pack AAA-level, hyper-realistic graphics into a mobile game. That, paired with its first-person perspective, help the game avoid any kind of uncanny valley sensation, and endear its boys with a sense of genuine liveliness as players interact with them. It makes sense, then, that Love and Deepspace skyrocketed past other similar titles and became the most profitable otome game in the <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/2024-q2-ios-top-5-otome%20games-revenue-us-60789073241bc16eb88c6e7f" rel="nofollow ">United States within a year of its release</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">So are all Love and Deepspace players just really horny for fake men?</h2><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace has plenty of racy outfits and spicy moments, but it doesn't portray sex or nudity. When situations do intensify,NSFW content is largely implied rather than explicitly shown, with the game instead highlighting the romantic elements at play rather than any exposed skin. For example, the excitement might come from Xavier taking and kissing the player's hand gently rather than from any implied sex.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm a sucker for a good romance, so having this game is like having a fun, sort of corny, very dramatic romance novel that I can appreciate and enjoy from a million different scenarios," Lon, a Rafayel fan who started playing in the spring of 2025, said. "It's a romance novel that writes its own fanfiction--<em>and </em>I can write my own fanfiction as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the romantic elements, those unfamiliar with the audience might assume Love and Deepspace is all about people using fictional men to live out their fantasies. This might be true for some players, but the relationship with these virtual men isn't so two-dimensional.</p><p dir="ltr">Rowan, a Love and Deepspace devotee who started playing in early 2025 after hearing about the game from friends, likened the boys to "court jesters" or "lab specimens." If they get bored, they can use the game to play a card game with one of the boys or watch them "fail at a claw machine."</p><p dir="ltr">"Something I think a lot of people misunderstand is that fans of [Love and Deepspace] generally don't <em>actually </em>think the guys are real or our boyfriends. It really is more like we are all fans of the game, and while we have our--to use Kpop terminology, 'biases'--at the end of the day, we are all just having fun. And yes, there is combat in this game. Really. It can get very hard sometimes,," Rowan laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">Rowan emphasized that it's not just about connecting with the boys on screen, but others who enjoy the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I talk to my friends who play the game every day, and I interact with other fans on TikTok and Bluesky," Rowan said. "We talk about the guys and their habits and voice lines; events that are going on, or levels we are trying to clear. It's a lot like being a fan of a boy band: Part of what makes it popular is being popular, in a way."</p>

			<p>Lords of the Fallen, the soulslike created by CI Games and Hexworks, is among the many hardcore action RPGs released in the past few years. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Even with some critical flaws</a></strong>, the game managed to capture the attention of fans of the genre with a unique dual world setup and a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"player first"</em> approach which became evident following the game's launch in September 2023. This approach led to the launch of multiple updates that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>addressed many of the game's launch flaws and added a significant amount of new features.</strong></a></p>



<p>The development of <a href="https://www.lordsofthefallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lords of the Fallen II</strong></a> seems to be anchored to a similar respect. While adding new features on top of the foundation led by its predecessor, the new game will respect player's time by providing an overall better experience right from launch.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">Following the gameplay reveal at this year's The Game Awards</a></strong>, we sat down with James Lowe, Game Director of Lords of the Fallen II, to discuss the sequel’s more brutal combat, the evolution of the Umbral realm, and the core philosophy guiding development this time around.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-brutality-of-dismemberment">The Brutality of Dismemberment</h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new feature that seems to define the game is the dismemberment system, which is a rare mechanic for a Soulslike. How did the idea for this system originally come about? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The dismemberment system grew out of a desire to make combat feel more physical, more brutal, and more reactive to the player’s actions. We wanted enemies to visibly reflect the damage they’ve taken, rather than simply falling to the floor when dispatched. When we were exploring ways to push the game’s darker tone while also reinforcing combat viscerality, dismemberment felt like a natural extension. We want players to finish encounters, look back and see the limbs of their foes scattered across the landscape.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-more-invasive-umbral-realm"><strong>A More Invasive Umbral Realm</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new Umbral realm has been defined as "more sinister," and that it will "step into you." What does this thematically and mechanically mean for the player? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Thematically, Umbral represents a much more invasive force this time around. It’s not simply a parallel world you observe, it’s something that actively intrudes on the player’s experience, reinforcing the sense that the world itself is hostile.</p>



<p>On the mechanical front, Umbral applies more constant pressure. It reacts more aggressively to player presence, influences combat and exploration more directly, and creates a heightened sense of tension the longer you remain within it. Visually, we’ve also pushed to ensure that Umbral feels distinct from Axiom in every region, with greater variation in mood, structure, and environmental storytelling.</p>



<h3 id="h-addressing-enemy-density-and-world-navigation"><strong>Addressing Enemy Density and World Navigation</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: One major piece of feedback from the original was that high enemy density often felt frustrating rather than challenging. How have you re-evaluated enemy placement and spawn logic? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The feedback around enemy density was taken very seriously. Difficulty should come from intentional encounter design, not from overwhelming the player with sheer numbers or unavoidable ranged pressure. In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em>, enemy placement and spawn logic have been reworked to emphasize clarity, spacing, and purpose. Encounters are designed around specific combat challenges... the result is difficulty that feels demanding but fair, and far less arbitrary.</p>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">: How has world design evolved to address concerns about confusing map layouts and navigation?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> World readability was a key focus for the sequel. Environmental landmarks, improved flow between areas, and more intuitive spatial logic all contribute to a world that still feels dense and mysterious, but far less confusing to navigate. And as a last resort if players are truly lost, we’re bringing back the Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic... which directs players to the next vestige.</p>

<h3 id="h-narrative-and-player-progression"><strong>Narrative and Player Progression</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: It has been said that the sequel will feature a "more accessible and character-driven" approach. How are you achieving this without sacrificing the deep lore the genre is known for? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The narrative approach is more mission driven this time, which helps ground the story emotionally and provide clearer motivations for the player. However, we’ve been careful not to sacrifice the genre’s strengths. The aim is clarity without over-explanation, giving players stronger narrative anchors while still rewarding curiosity and interpretation.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The original was criticized for upgrade mechanics that disincentivized experimentation. How does the sequel tackle this? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A</strong>: In the sequel, we’ve taken steps to reduce friction around upgrades and progression so that trying something new feels exciting rather than risky. The goal is to maintain meaningful choices while removing unnecessary barriers.</p>



<h3 id="h-technical-stability-and-post-launch-support"><strong>Technical Stability and Post-Launch Support</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">: Given the stuttering issues with some Unreal Engine 5 titles, what has been implemented to guarantee a smooth day one experience?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Our experience launching one of the earliest UE5 titles gave us valuable insight... these learnings have informed how we approach optimisations in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> from day one of production. We’re also working very closely with our partner, Epic, to proactively design around known constraints.</p>



<p><strong>Q: If you could distill all the learning from the community's feedback into one key principle that defines the development of Lords of the Fallen II, what would it be?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Respect the player’s time. That means clearer systems, stronger onboarding, great performance, and an overall experience that challenges as opposed to frustrates. Everything we’ve built in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> is guided by that idea.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Thank yo</strong><strong>u</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> for your time!</strong></p>

<h2>Comfortable, stylish headphones with fantastic audio</h2>
<p>Immediately upon trying on the Beats Solo 4, you’ll recognize how comfortable they feel due to their lightweight design and soft padded ear cups.

The Bass is deep and punches, the Midrange is clear and defined and the Treble remains bright and crisp even when turned up high.

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Virtual Reality Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/game-of-the-year-2025-best-virtual-reality-game/</link>
            <guid>1393639</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we come up on a decade since virtual reality gaming launched to the masses, it’s hard to say that it’s really managed to burst out of its niche. Sure, there’s been hits like Beat Saber that have entered into the mainstream consciousness, and everybody know that Meta, PlayStation, Apple and others have headsets ready and waiting for them to buy, but VR gaming remains more of a passion project.</p>
<p>But passion projects are the ones that bring the greatest leaps ahead. It’s these games that continue to pioneer new ways to think about existing genres, where teams dedicate themselves to finding those little</p>



<p>On the surface, Reach looks like many other VR games with fairly generic visuals, but you really have to play it to appreciate what Dreams Elevation have done.&nbsp; A subset of nDreams, the team were set up to explore new ways of moving and interacting in VR, inventing subtle features and tricks that make traversing a VR world as smooth as butter.</p>
<p>“Reach raises the bar for VR gaming, and it’s a great reason to dust off your headset,” we said in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/reach-review-a-leap-ahead-for-vr-action-games/"> review&nbsp;</a>and that remains true, Reach is a VR game where you can parkour through vast caverns and fling yourself around like an acrobat without any motion sickness. Chaining together moves, including throwing your Captain America style shield,&nbsp; quickly becomes second nature and makes other VR games feel stilted and robotic.&nbsp; There were a few glitches at launch but these have been patched out, so you really should add Reach to your wishlist.</p>

<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h3>The Midnight Walk – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The first and most immediately noticeable thing about The Midnight Walk is its beautifully terrifying art style. It’s hard not to be impressed by the artistry, using actual, real-life clay to make a stop-motion video game is already quite the achievement, but to have it look so damn good and work well in VR is remarkable. You might be a little too busy to marvel at how impressive things are though, as it’s absolutely bloody terrifying. From the dark, dingy environments to the truly horrifying monsters that are stalking you, it’s an incredibly creepy and unsettling aesthetic that the music and sound design matches, as well.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re desperately trying to stay away from unspeakable abominations, you’re also trying to bring warmth back into the world with the help of Potboy, an adorable – in a Tim Burton kind of way – lantern who can help light things up a little for you. It involves a lot of walking, but in VR and in this world that’s plenty to keep you entertained, especially since there are horrifying monsters stalking you. Some of the puzzles are particularly creative as well, sometimes even unique, as you’re wrapped up in a wordless narrative that builds up to its emotional conclusion. The Midnight Walk is&nbsp;a game that really demonstrates how much of a difference playing in VR can make.</p>
<p><em>– Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Lumines Arise – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Tetsuya <span>Mizuguchi</span> has completed the circle of his synaesthetic gaming journey, reviving the block-dropping puzzle game of Lumines for a new generation. The PSP original was already an experimental blend of game, music and visuals, as your actions and progress fed new sounds and added layers to the ambient soundtrack, and Mizuguchi-san was able to explore them once more with Tetris Effect in 2018, able to take everything so much further thanks to the dawn of VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a> takes the lessons learned from Tetris Effect and folds them back into Lumines’ framework, expanding on the series’ formula, bringing new life and energy with it, and in the process, crafting another genre-defining puzzle game. As with Tetris Effect, it’s a game that you really want to experience in VR if you possibly can.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/rainbow-six-siege-hack-online-telegram-india/</link>

		<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is now back online after the servers were shut down for over two days while Ubisoft dealt with a massive security breach.&nbsp; In the evening of 26th December players began to notice billions of in-game currency being added to their accounts and super rare skins being dropping into their inventories. Other players were banned, and some were unbanned.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have now rolled back all the data so players should have the correct amount of in-game credit, known as Renown. They state that players may find themselves in a queue to get back in to the game.</p>


<p>The event has kicked off a war of words between various hacking groups who are claiming they are responsible, and also that one groups have stolen the source code for every Ubisoft game. These claims seem to be an exaggeration and probably not true.</p>
<p>However, there is evidence to suggest that Ubisoft were not hacked at all. It is reported that Ubisoft had outsourced helpdesk support to a company in India and that an employee there was bribed to give “Panel Access” to a third party. This then gave the third party access to user accounts, ban functions and other facilities. If this is true then Ubisoft were not hacked, it was bribery and human corruption that caused the issues.</p>
<p>It is also reported that another group is contacting people on Telegram claiming they have their personal details from hacking Ubisoft, and they are demanding money. This appears to be a scam and they have no connection to the group that breached the Rainbow Six servers. Ubisoft have, so far, not stated that any user data was breached.</p>

<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:195261,183040 @ 1767024063 -->
<hr>
<p>We've had our eyes on this long-lost GBA-looking adventure ever since we first discovered it at Gamescom <a href="https://x.com/ZionDood/status/1826268852617126059">back in 2024</a>. The combat, movement, and visuals instantly reminded us of the handheld Zelda entries, but instead of a sword, the main protagonist uses a yoyo to dispatch foes and solve loads of puzzles. You've also got a spunky, blue bat protagonist that looks like they jumped straight out of the SNES era. What's not to love here?!</p>
<p>Pocket Trap's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> comes to Switch this week, and to celebrate we linked up with the Game Director and Lead Programmer <strong>Henrique Lorenzi</strong> to ask some questions about his love for yoyos, Nintendo's games, and Yoko Shimomura.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:179410 @ 1767023654 -->

<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: We played through the free demo you have on the Switch eShop, and we loved how</strong> <strong>versatile an item the yoyo is for Pippit! Do you remember when you had that lightbulb</strong> <strong>moment, when you knew you wanted to build a game around a yoyo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Henrique Lorenzi:</strong> As game designers, we’ve found that one of the best ways to create enjoyable experiences is to take objects that the player is familiar with in the real world and transform them into gameplay mechanics. We’ve made it a habit to set up a board at the beginning of every project, where the entire team can participate by throwing in ideas. So we had a board full of images of ordinary objects like a hammer, a slingshot, a baseball bat, a hand saw, roller skates – you name it! The yoyo was special, though.</p>
<p>Not only could it be considered a 'cool kid’s' item, but the gameplay ideas involving it started pouring in non-stop! At that point, the lightbulb lit up, as you said – we realised this item would allow for a pretty extensive and deep game! We started sketching game screens, thinking about how the various challenges would play out – it was at this point that we also incorporated diagonals to the level design, which are places where the yoyo can bounce off of and help extend your range. Everything felt solid, and we were confident we had some great game-design possibilities in our hands!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8fb113110385"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8fb113110385/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Early development sketches — <em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Did the yoyo start life as anything else originally, or did you always know you wanted the main weapon to be one?</strong></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to make some kind of a 'Zelda-like' game, but try to stray away from medieval fantasy themes. So we were looking for an item that could replace the sword in combat. After we stumbled upon the humble yoyo, we noticed a pretty strong point in its favour: differently to the usual approach of having the player juggle a wide range of items that each enable a certain action – like having weapons for combat, a boomerang for puzzle-solving, and special boots for wall-jumping and platforming –, the yoyo would be able to cover all of these use-cases on its own!</p>
<p>The player’s progression would be tied to the knowledge of particular yoyo tricks, so it perfectly translated the experience someone might have with the real thing. And regarding the game’s setting and themes, the yoyo provided a great opportunity to take everything into the contemporary era! So you’re a radical kid using your favourite toy in a modern-world city with modern-world problems. We had hit the perfect combo for the relatable experience we wanted to create!</p>
<p><strong>From the demo alone, we can see a lot of Nintendo’s DNA in Pipistrello. This really does look and feel like something that would have been released on the GBA! What games in particular do you feel the team drew inspiration from?</strong></p>
<p>I’m so glad you’ve noticed this! We’re longtime Nintendo fans, and everyone on the team has grown up playing Nintendo games. The Game Boy Advance really felt like peak handheld gaming back in the day, so we were excited at the possibility of bringing a nostalgic feeling to players familiar with it. We’ve even added an optional 3D Console mode to the game that simulates the experience of playing on a real GBA, including responsive buttons, an adjustable and rotatable camera, and – get this – even glare from the screen if you hold it at just the right position!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e5f334052a4bc"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5f334052a4bc/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But of course, we didn’t want to just mimic the thing, but also modernise the gaming experience and make it appealing to new players as well: the physics engine has lots of quality-of-life improvements – such as coyote-time, corner-sliding, landing assist, and magnetic edges – and if you get a Game Over you can restart from the same screen without any downtime. One of our aspirations was perhaps to create a new source of joy that could be passed down through generations, just like Nintendo has.</p>
<p>Speaking of games that have inspired us, I’d say the most direct have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, but we also took a page from older and newer games alike – from the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> on the NES, to the latest entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the world map and exploration? Will there be interconnected areas like in a Metroidvania, or will there be sections that have a start and a finish, much like a Zelda dungeon?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a bit of everything in Pipistrello! The navigation around the city is completely interconnected, with branching and merging paths. The city map is fully filled in and massive, so you can bet there will be something interesting no matter what direction you go in, and on top of everything, it’s teeming with secrets! Did I mention we also have a second layer to the entire city? Players can drop below to the sewers level and explore even more sprawling environments – something akin to the Dark World or the Depths!</p>
<p>Beyond that, once you reach a dungeon or mini-dungeon, the experience becomes more like a classic Zelda – strongly thematic and narrative-driven experiences which emphasise one or more specific game mechanics. Remember we kept our themes contemporary, so our dungeons take place in a police department, a shopping mall, a skyscraper mid-construction, a pop-culture convention, a sports stadium, and more! I think players will have a blast unravelling each location’s lore and secrets.</p>

<p><strong>We had a blast with the demo, but we found the Don Mauretti boss fight particularly challenging! We liked how theoretically you could defeat him with simple yoyo strikes, but you could deal more damage by bouncing the yoyo off walls. Will the game have any sort of difficulty options, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how tough do you think he is in comparison to other bosses in the game?</strong></p>
<p>It does feel way more challenging in the demo! That fight has been tailored for players with many hours of experience in the game, and we didn’t want to nerf the boss for the demo and risk losing the interesting bits. We offer three scenarios in the demo so that players can have a taste of different parts of the game, but these scenarios aren’t consecutive in the full game at all. At the point you go against Don Mauretti in the full game, the player will have access to many Badges and Upgrades, not to mention Charged and Special Moves such as the Parry and the Flurry Attack – all things that the full game introduces at an appropriate pace, providing detailed explanations and training areas to practice – so we’re confident the player will have the ability and the tools necessary to overcome these fights! The game’s progression is not linear, so a player can even explore other city districts and fight other bosses before going into Don Mauretti’s turf.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game also offers several difficulty settings, which allow the player to fine-tune the gameplay experience to suit their tastes, both to the easier side as well as the harder side. We’d say Don Mauretti is about a 7 or 8 on the difficulty scale, and the four main bosses have all been designed to display a similar level of challenge. These four main bosses serve as the final trial on the player’s mastery journey throughout each city district and dungeon, so each one offers something different in terms of required skills and fight dynamics. But don’t forget there are still other bosses and mini-bosses (and secret bosses!) for the player to track down and fight!</p>
<p><strong>We also noticed some issues with the frame rate dropping pretty substantially in the final section of the Don boss fight (we were playing in handheld mode.) Do you hope to have those issues worked out for the full launch on Switch?</strong></p>
<p>After the demo launched, we’ve gone through extensive optimisation passes on the Nintendo Switch. We’re so sorry about your previous experience! Now I can say that all areas of the game run perfectly smoothly, including the boss fight you mentioned, no matter if you’re playing it docked or handheld! The Nintendo Switch is a priority of ours, and we’ve put a lot of work into it, with things like HD Rumble support tailored for each action Pippit can take. We believe it’s one of the best platforms to enjoy the game on! The updated demo should be available shortly on the Nintendo eShop, so you don’t have to just take my word for it.</p>

<p><strong>We took a look through the developer credits and we noticed you have Yoko Shimomura on the team composing the soundtrack! Whoa! Can you talk about the process of pitching the game to her and what it’s been like working with her?</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up with Nintendo games, we’ve naturally grown up attached to Yoko Shimomura’s work as well! With our idea to develop a GBA-inspired game, who else would be most suited to bring on board if not her? We felt that, taking into account her work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> and the <strong>Mario &amp; Luigi</strong> series, and especially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> on the GBA, she could bring unmatched authenticity to Pipistrello’s retro design aesthetic, and it could result in the game being elevated even more towards that Nintendo standard we were seeking. Naturally, it was kind of nerve-wracking contacting a world-class composer like her for the first time! We didn’t know if she’d even agree to working with us.</p>
<p>We knew she could have a very tight schedule, so we made sure to pitch this to her very early on – we sent out the first email one whole year before production actually started! (Maybe that was an excessively long time? But it pays to think in advance!) Much to our surprise, she was very open to the idea! We sent her full documents describing the game and the setting, along with screenshots and videos of the areas she’d be composing for, as well as some musical references (some of them her own songs!)</p>
<p>I imagine it must have been quite a surprise to her that we weren’t looking for a full orchestral sound, but we actually asked for the production to take a step back and embrace the GBA era! So she employed some of those vintage Roland Sound Canvas synthesisers used back in the day, for a real throwback. We were extremely happy with the experience, and will most definitely be looking to repeat this partnership in the future! I hope players will keep an ear out while playing the game!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we have to know...does anyone on the development team know any rad, real-world yoyo tricks? Bonus points if they can prove it!</strong></p>
<p>As kids, we had a lot of contact with toy yoyos, and companies were even packaging them with snacks and soda. But that’s hardly anything that allows us to be considered enthusiasts, let alone professionals at the yoyo.</p>

<p>That said, we did actually go deep into research while developing Pipistrello, watching yoyo competition videos, learning the theory behind a multitude of tricks, and speaking with people who know this topic way better than us!</p>
<p>Some people on the team obtained professional yoyos during development to aid in the creative process (and played around with them for a bit), and one of us actually has more experience with the diabolo, a related apparatus. All in all, though, I think becoming a yoyo champion is a fantasy best left to Pippit at this point, haha!</p>

			<p>While opinions may vary on how Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series' signature formula and gameplay, there's no denying that the game's performance on PC and consoles isn't where it should be. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4 is a step in the right direction for sure</strong></a>, but more work is needed besides&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the over 100 performance improvements introduced</strong></a>&nbsp;to finally address what is, sti</span>ll today, one of the game's biggest issues, if not the biggest.</p>



<p>Besides working on improving Monster Hunter Wilds' performance, however, some datamined information suggests that CAPCOM could be working on something else as well: <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game.</strong></p>



<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/"><strong>Monster Hunter Leaks subreddit</strong></a>, some dedicated users took a good look at the aforementioned Title Update 4, discovering some information on the potential arrival of <strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong> and additional content in the future. The most interesting discovery, however, is the addition of some platform information mentioning a <strong>"nsw2UpgradeEdition"</strong>, possibly referencing a Nintendo Switch 2 release for the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Considering how Monster Hunter Wilds runs on PC and consoles, the community's reaction didn't disappoint. <span><em>"Game barely runs on PC properly, and they expect it to port to Switch 2?"</em>&nbsp;said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxx67z/comment/nwe8ta9/"><strong>Ayyzeee</strong></a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, echoing what most of the community thinks about this port, which looks more impossible than the solid <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</strong></a> Nintendo Switch 2 ports.</span> </p>



<p><em>"The Steam Deck can barely run this as is, and now we have a SW2 port? </em><span><em>Good luck,"</em>&nbsp;said <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415472">Kindekuma on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, further highlighting how the community doesn't think bringing Monster Hunter Wilds to Nintendo Switch 2 is the b</span>est idea.</p>



<p>Other users didn't miss the chance to joke on what could be expected out of this Nintendo Switch 2 port. <em>"Now at a blistering 480p/20fps"</em>, <em>"Are they going to upscale 160 × 144px to 1080p?"</em> said ResetERA users <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149414158">Mars People</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415184"><strong>Melhadf.</strong></a> <em>"Potato Mode"</em> is also a recurring joke, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149419351"><strong>Dale Copper's image</strong></a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Nintendo-Switch-2-potato-mode.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This is the level of visual fidelity the community expects in the potential Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jokes aside, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how possible is a Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong> As the Nintendo console already proved to be a more than capable system with some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">excellent multiplatform ports</a></strong>, there's no denying that getting the latest entry in the series to run properly on the system can be a challenge. </p>



<p>Currently, the Steam Deck struggles to run the game properly, even with aggressive upscaling, so the game would require significant optimization for the system to achieve a stable 30 FPS. Still, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-impress-rog-ally-x-comparison/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS</strong></a>, this port could be surprisingly good, especially if performance continues to improve on other platforms as well.</p>



<p>Besides performance, which continues to remain a significant issue, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffered from a very low challenge level. This issue, thankfully, was addressed by the game's post-launch updates, <span>to the extent that the game's director, Yuya Takuda, hopes&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/" target="_blank"><strong>lapsed players will return to the game</strong></a>, which, in my opinion,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank"><strong>still deserves to be played</strong></a>, despite</span> its issues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Was 2025 The Year of The Extraction Shooter?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2025-year-of-the-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1393624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the wide world of gaming, few genres embody the risk and reward loop as starkly as the extraction shooter. It’s a genre constructed around the concepts of triumph and devastation, with these games demanding mechanical skill and psychological resilience. In 2025, extraction shooters blew up all over again, but can we honestly say that the genre <strong>took over </strong>this year?</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the stock of extraction shooters released in 2025 and determine if this really was the year of the extraction genre.</p>











<p>Typically, extraction shooters are unwelcoming titles that thrive on punishing mechanics. The likes of Escape from Tarkov have kept the genre from entering the mainstream too much, boasting complex mechanics, no guidance systems, and combat that can see you gunned down by a single shot.</p>



<p>But in 2025, extraction shooters became <strong>much more accessible</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite launched on Steam and allowed players to access a free Tarkov alternative with some more forgiving mechanics. Escape from Duckov emerged as a single-player, satirical take on Tarkov, and it was equal parts adorable and relatively easy.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget the breakout extraction adventure of 2025, ARC Raiders. Embark Studios’ second title was praised for its organic community-driven growth rather than corporate hype and punishing gameplay loops.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-surge-of-shooters">A Surge of Shooters</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2025, a sheer surge of extraction titles was released or updated with fresh content and upgrades. Everything from Gray Zone Warfare to Zero Sievert, and from The Forever Winter to Escape from Tarkov had a limelight moment in 2025, allowing for untold exposure across the industry to these challenging titles.</p>



<p>And we’re not done yet, as there are more to hit the market, such as Bungie’s Marathon.</p>



<p>This abundance of extraction shooter goodness created something of a paradox. The slew of extraction shooters meant that fans had more than ever to enjoy, but the saturation came thick and fast, potentially running the risk of diluting what it means to be this tougher-than-average title feeding a niche market.</p>



<p>It seemed that every developer was at least <strong>considering </strong>the extraction shooter model in some way.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters in 2025 were so much bigger than just <strong>games</strong>. Titles like ARC Raiders proved to be monumental things that got everyone buzzing about something <strong>new</strong> and <strong>energetic</strong>. This year, streamers and content creators <strong>blew up </strong>alongside the biggest extraction titles, and it’s not every genre that can do that.</p>



<p>It was also the year that developers started playing with the concept of the extraction shooter, seeing how far they could push the envelope. That’s partly why Embark Studios made an extraction <strong>adventure </strong>game and not an extraction shooter specifically.</p>







<p>It depends on your perspective, but it’s easy to claim that 2025 <strong>was </strong>the year of the extraction shooter. From the sheer number of releases to the records set and broken by the most popular launches, the extraction vertical was a smash hit in 2025.</p>



<p>Many of the genre’s most capable purists have voiced their concerns about too many casual extraction shooters potentially tuning down the genre, but they’re shouting into the void mostly. If this isn’t the year of the extraction shooter, then it’s certainly the year that the genre evolved.</p>



<p>It’s a transformation that could either strengthen or weaken extraction shooters, depending on how you look at it.</p>



<p>This was a landmark year, either way. In 2025, extraction shooters became household names, and in terms of viewers, creators, and streamers, these games positively soared. </p>
