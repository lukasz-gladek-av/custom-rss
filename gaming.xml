I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.

Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently announced changes to Fortnite Crew</a> have been accompanied by some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4udhl/why_is_no_one_talking_about_the_massive_xp_nerf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">unpopular</a> <a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">changes</a> to XP gains in Chapter 6 Season 1, with progress slowing compared with past seasons--a jarring shift after the just-ended Remix season was overly generous with XP.</p><p>As with every new Fortnite season, players spent Chapter 6's launch day binge-playing the new battle royale map and trying out all the new weapons and items. But a lot of folks noticed something odd after playing all day--they weren't as far along in the new battle pass as they'd normally expect to be. Whereas dedicated players could usually earn 20 or 30 levels just from playing a lot on day 1, this time around, a lot of folks (including myself) found their gains grinding to a halt before they hit double digits.</p><p>This is reportedly the result of some newly implemented major changes to how XP is primarily gained in Fortnite. Season-long milestones for battle royale have been removed entirely, there is now just one set of three daily quests for all modes combined instead of quests for each mode, and XP in other modes (Lego, Reload, OG, Festival, Save the World, and Creative) is now primarily time-based and hard-capped weekly--it only takes a few hours to reach the cap, and after that gains are reduced to a trickle.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to dataminers</a>, Lego, Reload and OG modes all share one pool of weekly playtime XP, capping at 21 levels in total. Creative modes cap out at about 11 levels gained per week, Save the World caps out at nine levels, and Festival actually has a daily cap of just over one, single level. These caps only apply to passive, playtime-based XP, so any quests would provide an additional boost.</p><p>Battle royale and Zero Build, meanwhile, have had their passive XP removed entirely, which is why gains slow down so much once you finish the weekly and kickstart quests.</p><p>This is likely a consequence of the new changes to how Fortnite Crew works. With the new chapter, a Fortnite Crew subscription now includes the Lego Pass, the Music Pass, and the upcoming monthly OG Passes, but the rub is that you can only earn rewards on those passes while subscribed--you no longer get the battle pass for the duration for buying Crew at the start of the season. Since the price of a month of Crew didn't change, some trade-offs were to be expected, and so Epic Games rationing XP on a weekly basis so players progress at a more steady rate makes sense in that context.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a bit of a backlash to theses changes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h573kg/we_have_their_attention/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4x5on/does_epic_just_nerfed_the_daily_xp_of_each_mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reddit</a>, but Epic likely will wait and see how everybody feels in a couple weeks before making any changes. The company made a similar attempt to ration XP over the course of a season when Chapter 4 launched two years ago, with weekly quests that expired instead of staying until the season ended. It took nearly two months for Epic to revert that change, despite a similar response from fans. That said, this is the sort of thing that Epic can hotfix without a big update, so this status quo could change at any time.</p>

                <p>A low-quality video of what appears to be a Nintendo Switch 2 has emerged, prompting fan speculation over the as-yet-unseen console and the validity of this footage.</p><p>The video was posted on Chinese video site <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19GzdYSEhe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bibli</a> and was first spotted by <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/rumor-leaked-images-of-switch-2-joy-cons-surface-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leak-joycon-looks-like-release-date-1851711427?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). The footage appears to show someone removing a joycon from the side of the Switch 2 screen by simply pulling it off. The controllers themselves seem to sport infrared sensors (on both the left and right joycons) and bigger shoulder buttons.

However, the blurry footage could be fake, and feature a version of the console constructed using information from prior leaks.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Edited video by me (since the original video is 5+ minutes long)</p><p>We can also see the man de-attaching the Joy-Cons at the beginning of the video <a href="https://t.co/RtIVDQJOlX" rel="nofollow   ">pic.twitter.com/RtIVDQJOlX</a></p></div>  — Adrien190303 #ThankYouToriyama (@Adrien190303) <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien190303/status/1863624665647792557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> - the spruce-up of the racer once referred to as "objectively loads better" than Mario Kart by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, causing eyebrows to catapult clean off people's faces - is making its way to Game Pass this Wednesday, 4th December.
</p>
<p>
Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is, of course, developer Beenox's effervescent remaster of 1999 PlayStation cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing">Crash Team Racing</a>, which - alongside a significant audio-visual makeover - introduced elements from 2003's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-nitro-kart">Crash Nitro Kart</a> and 2005's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-tag-team-racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>. "[It's] is a gold-standard remaster," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-generous-remaster-of-a-cult-classic">his review</a> back in 2019, "capturing the loveably janky, off-brand spirit of classic CTR - and then some." 
</p>
<p>
"It's just plain, dumb fun, a game completely unashamed of itself even now," he continued. "I think that's probably why, even beyond the enormously generous treatment it's had from Beenox... CTR is still one of the best kart racers ever made." He then slapped it with a Eurogamer Essential, whereupon heads across the world began to explode, Scanners-style.

<p>
Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is the first game to be confirmed for Microsoft's December Game Pass line-up (you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">November's over here</a>). It's also the latest in a slow trickle of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> titles to have hit the subscription service - following on from the likes of Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Diablo 4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the publisher</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
And if you're not already a Game Pass subscriber, you might be interested to hear Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-reinstating-its-11-game-pass-trial-but-only-for-pc">reinstated its previous £1/$1 14-day trial offer</a> - but only for PC.

GOG started it with a list of 100 games, including <em>Diablo </em>and <em>Resident Evil 1-3.</em></p><p><em>Warcraft I </em>and <em>Warcraft II </em>are being delisted from GOG “at the publisher’s request,” the company says. Their publisher, Blizzard, released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295730/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest-1-2-3-reforged-upgrades-windows-mac-blizzard-battle-net">remastered versions</a> of <em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>Warcraft II</em> the same day the preservation program was announced. You can still buy the games before they’re removed, and GOG is offering discount code  MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which shaves a little off the price for those buying a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarcraft_bundle">bundle containing both games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the best deal we've seen on this beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> all year, including its discounted price during Prime Day in October.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Splendor Now for $19.99</h2><div catalogid="0641b3cd-4fd7-4dd4-904b-3f20f273a1e5" id="212898"><div id="212898" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor was released in 2014 and has remained a popular title among board game enthusiasts since. The beauty of Splendor lies in its simplicity: It's a great game to bust out a family gathering for players of all ages and experience levels due to its intuitive ruleset and average 30-minute playtime. Once you get a handle on the basic premise of the game, there's room for plenty of strategy to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an economic engine game designed around the concept that players are working to build an increasingly powerful economy to buy cards that earn them points (dubbed "prestige" in the world of Splendor). In good ol' Renaissance fashion, your currency is none other than gemstones, which are represented by multi-colored tokens. The end goal is to reach 15 prestige points, which you accumulate by purchasing cards worth variable amounts of points with the gems you collect.

                <p>There's a new era for NASCAR games coming in 2025, but fans may want to grab the previous titles while they still can. Motorsport Games, the company that until recently held the rights to make NASCAR racing games, has announced that all of its NASCAR titles and associated DLC will be pulled from digital storefronts on December 31.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>To the NASCAR game community!</p><p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARHeat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARHeat</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARRivals</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/7RyCQXuZUo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7RyCQXuZUo</a></p></div>  — Motorsport Games (@MSportgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The silver lining from that announcement is that titles like NASCAR Heat, NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR: Ignition will be going on sale before the games are delisted. All of the affected games and their physical disc counterparts will remain playable after January 1, 2025, they just won't be directly available for online purchases. </p><p>NASCAR branded games date back to 1991 with Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge, and the license has been utilized by several different gaming publishers over the decades. The current NASCAR rights holder is iRacing, which reportedly plans to release NASCAR '25 across all consoles and PC in Fall 2025. </p><p>Real-life NASCAR racers have previously shown their support for games based on their events. Perhaps most notably, Ross Chastain credited NASCAR 2005 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nascar-driver-uses-video-game-inspired-trick-on-final-lap-and-it-actually-worked/1100-6508780/" data-ref-id="1100-6508780">for his thrilling wallride finish in 2022</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-crossover-for-early-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
There's another Call of Duty collaboration on the way. Following crossovers from the likes of Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and The Boys, Activision has revealed it's teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> to shove the streaming service's hugely popular Squid Game TV series into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone early next year.
</p>
<p>
Squid Game, which follows a group of players attempting to survive a series of deadly children's games in order to win a BIG CASH PRIZE, took the world by storm when it first aired on Netflix back in 2021. It's been a long time coming, but the show is finally set to return for a second series on 26th December, and Netflix's promotional efforts are now in full swing.
</p>
<p>
And so enter Call of Duty. Activision unveiled its impending Squid Game crossover via a thirty second teaser trailer, in which a dashingly behatted Operator discovers a mysterious envelope emblazoned with symbols one 'X' away from a PlayStation copyright claim. It all ends with the Call of Duty logo emerging in a sequence reminiscent of Squid Game's opening titles, after which we're informed the collaboration is set to begin in January 2025.

<p>
Beyond that, specifics are limited to the point of non-existent. We do know the crossover is coming to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone early next year, but whether it'll offer anything more substantial than romper-suit-style premium cosmetics remains to be seen.
</p><p>
Call of Duty's Squid Game collaboration won't be the first digital take on the hit Korean television show to barrel out in conjunction with Netflix's season two promotions, however. The streaming service's own internally developed Squid Game Unleashed - a multiplayer "party royale" for iOS and Android devices - launches for subscribers on 17th December. It's just one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month">more than 80 titles currently in development</a> as part of Netflix's continuing push into the world of gaming, although one of its most intriguing projects - a new AAA game led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">now been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Call of Duty, it seems to be having a strong 2024. Microsoft recently announced Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">managed to set a record</a> for most "Game Pass subscribers adds on launch day" - a record previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> following its launch last year.

                <p>A new report alleges that PC hardware company NZXT's PC rental program is "shady and manipulative." The video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamers Nexus</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) accuses NZXT of changing prices and parts between "purchase" and "rental" versions of prebuilt PCs with the same (or similar) names.</p><p>For context, NZXT's Flex program allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 (though a renter would need to provide a monitor, keyboard, and mouse). Gamers Nexus claims that specs and prices of prebuilt PC models change depending on whether you select "buy" or "rent." The exact prices and specs can change "day to day" according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0pomC1CfpC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For example, the video shows that a "Player: Three Prime" model PC contained an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if a customer was set to buy it, whereas the rental version contained an RTX 4080 Super. However, the performance estimates--showing expected frame rates in certain games--did not change between the two models, despite containing significantly different hardware. These specs allegedly changed multiple times while Gamers Nexus was completing its report.</p><p>The Flex program's alleged issues don't stop there. Gamers Nexus highlights the Flex program's price point. Within nine or so months, the price of renting one of NZXT prebuilds will outstrip the cost of buying the PC (or its component parts) outright, with no rent-to-own option. Additionally, the report calls outs the program's "aggressive" terms of service, which allegedly allow NZXT to sell data created or stored on the rented PC.</p><p>NZXT has released a response on <a href="https://x.com/NZXT/status/1863388904205799769" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter,</a> which states, "We are aware of the recent claims made against us and are actively reviewing the situation. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing this thoroughly and will share an official statement soon. Thank you for your patience as we work to provide clarity."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-friend-and-i-have-finally-finished-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes.1050141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started playing puzzle game <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> shortly after its release back in May, and almost immediately realized it would be <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">much better with a buddy</a>. And it was: it was useful to have a friend to talk over puzzles with, and cool to get to introduce a non-gaming friend to a game. And then it took us six months to actually <em>finish</em> it, because we are both adults with lives.</p><p>My friend and I got together infrequently for play sessions. Sometimes our schedules just couldn’t line up; other times, we’d meet up intending to play but then get distracted catching up on our lives until it got too late. (The main lesson this experience taught us was that we need to hang out more.) When we <em>did</em> play, we had a lot of fun. We both appreciated the game’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzles-logic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logic</a>: how we knew we usually had the tools to solve a puzzle in front of us, and how the game generally makes it clear where to look for which puzzle’s clues. In puzzles that involved navigation, it was helpful to have one person look at a photo of a map or of the clues on their phone while the other steered our character.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for </strong><strong><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></strong><strong> follow.)</strong></p><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Lorelei </em>was a great game to play with someone who doesn’t play games much, given its pared-down controls and emphasis on puzzles rather than technical gaming skills. But it was still sometimes a challenge: your character doesn’t always steer so well, and my friend especially had trouble navigating the confusing perspective of the hotel’s backyard. The bug report puzzles gave us both a bit of trouble: while I haven’t played a lot of older games, I understood what these areas were referencing, but my friend got frustrated with the clunky inverted controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I think our biggest mistake was how long we went between playing, which made it easy to forget what we were doing or what task we'd left off in the middle of. This was particularly a problem this weekend, when we had nothing left but logging into the supercomputer to end the game. We had a general sense of which pieces we needed, but we'd forgotten precisely what to do with them. Eventually, we relented and looked up a guide, only to realize with despair that we would have to go back to the mazes, parts of the game we were <em>totally</em> over. We had to wrack our brains to remember where to find the maze and how to get to its center <em>again</em>, and it definitely made the end of the game feel a little draggy.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of guides, we didn’t use them much, but we did reference them on occasion when we were totally stumped. We had a big debate about it every time before we did it, and we tried our best not to accidentally read ahead. I’ll admit guides were helpful when the solution to a puzzle involved a lot of trekking around, though we did feel a bit disappointed in ourselves when we did it.&nbsp;</p><p>Our running joke with the game was that the reward for every puzzle was going to be <em>another</em> puzzle, and this proved true once we finally got into the supercomputer. I don’t think either of us <em>loved</em> the end, though this might also have been a consequence of how long we went between playing. A lot of the game’s plot was a bit hazy in our memories, and my friend especially was annoyed with one last bit of clunky navigation. But we felt good about finally finishing the game, even if we'd long lost the thread on who was who and why it mattered. And while I can't speak for my friend, I at least had a lot of fun looking up other players' interpretations of the story now that I'd finally seen its conclusion.</p><p>We didn’t 100% the game, which we both feel OK with. There’s an entire map we seem to be missing, even though I can’t find any indication that there’s an area we missed, and some memories we didn’t unlock. While neither of us is motivated to poke around the post-credits game given how bad we've been with our schedules, we’ll see if I can stick to my contentment with where we ended up when I’m alone with my PC.</p><p>I promised to introduce my friend to <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> next, another puzzle game everyone I know loved but which I kind of bounced off all by myself. I have it on my Switch, which means we can play it on my friend’s TV, which means we can sit on her couch instead of my sad PC setup where one of us had to sit on the stepstool that functions as my apartment's only other chair.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah: <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> was a very good game that took us way too long to beat! Games with friends are fun! I can finally talk about it with everyone, long after everyone else is done with it! Come remember a game you surely beat ages ago and talk to me about it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
