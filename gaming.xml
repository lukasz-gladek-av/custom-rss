            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-manga-deals-crunchyroll-store-viz-media-sale-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Last chance to save on Viz Media books. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crunchyroll Store is currently offering a 30% discount on all Viz Media books. Anyone familiar with manga knows Viz is a primary publisher of official English translations, so the sale includes a wide range of individual tankōbon volumes, as well as deluxe editions, art books, and even coloring books. With more than 2,000 volumes of manga on sale, every type of manga reader should be able to find something. While there are plenty of options for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-free-manga-sites-and-apps">reading manga online</a>, there's always something special about flipping through the pages of your favorite series and getting to see it on your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Crunchyroll usually struggles to match Amazon prices, many of the manga deals I've listed here have actually gone lower. Otherwise, you can shop the full sale <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It ends tonight, so if you’re trying to stock up, now’s your chance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">30% Off Viz Manga at Crunchyroll Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale is a great opportunity to try out a new manga or pick up new volumes of something you’ve already been reading (online or otherwise). Highlights include every single volume of Dan Da Dan, which is about to start airing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-da-dan-season-2-announced-and-its-just-a-few-months-away">its second anime season</a>. In general, the sale is a great opportunity to check out the manga that inspired recent anime hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix">Sakamoto Days</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frieren-beyond-journeys-end-premiere-review">Frieren</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if we’re talking about iconic anime, you'll also find discounts on classics like Dragon Ball, One Piece, and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. One series I personally recommend that hasn't gotten an anime adaptation (at least not yet) is Kagurabachi. Otherwise, your best bet is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">scrolling through the full sale</a>, which you can sort by individual series. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Art Books Also Included</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Viz Media also publishes a substantial amount of art books and other physical merchandise. Aside from the standard slate of popular manga, these publications highlight authors like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-junji-ito-manga">Junji Ito</a> and animation giants like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-studio-ghibli-movies">Studio Ghibli</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Do You Need a Crunchyroll Account to Shop the Sale? </strong></h2><div catalogid="ca43b5d5-9f77-4193-8c44-062eab8a5174" id="215876"><div id="215876" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crunchyroll Premium</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Choose from the Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan tiers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope!

Included in its list of festivities are videos that fondly look back at The Witcher 3 as well as special events and unique merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all starts with the trailer, below, celebrating the series’ monster-hunting protagonist, Geralt, highlighting some of his most memorable moments as fans are treated to actor Doug Cockle’s gravelly delivery. It’s not quite a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv"><u>Witcher 4</u></a> update, but it does do a good job of reminding viewers of what made The Witcher 3 so special in the first place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Cockle joined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRkbwmlNsg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the latest installment in CD Projekt Red’s REDstreams</u></a> to reminisce about the 20 years he’s spent providing his voice for the English version of Geralt while sharing how he helped shape the White Wolf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to join in on The Witcher 3’s 10th anniversary celebration, CD Projekt has further outlined its plans to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-announces-concert-tour-for-the-witcher-3-10-year-anniversary"><u>The Witcher concerts</u></a> to fans this summer. The first is in Boston at the Emerson Colonial Theater, come May 31, with the second following in Poland at Poznan's Sala Ziemi. <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/pl/en/concert" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tickets</u></a> for both events, as well as the European leg of an upcoming tour, are available now, and more tour dates will be revealed in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt said more surprises, including art from 10 different Witcher artists, are on the way in the form of a Displate collaboration, T-shirts, and mugs.

More details about what to expect will be revealed in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each item, stream, and event will help die-hard fans celebrate the critically acclaimed 2015 RPG, but it should also help with the wait for The Witcher 4. Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-debut-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms-single-player-open-world-action-rpg-the-game-awards-2024"><u>pulling back the curtain</u></a> on the Ciri-focused follow-up at The Game Awards 2024, CD Projekt has (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-issues-psa-after-the-witcher-4-beta-test-rumors-catch-fire"><u>mostly</u></a>) kept its head down when it comes to its progress.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> creative director Neil Druckmann has announced that he is currently working on another Naughty Dog title in addition to the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Though we've known for some time that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">currently working on multiple projects</a>--and that's excluding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/#:~:text=The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Online%20was%20one%20of%20those%20games,who%20got%20to%20play%20it." data-ref-id="1100-6529585">recently canceled</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-online/" data-ref-id="5000-565972">The Last of Us Online</a>, to be clear--this is our first confirmation that Druckmann is involved in a game other than Intergalactic. Considering Druckmann has confirmed that he does have a concept for The Last of Us III and felt like there would probably be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">one more chapter to the story</a>," it seems entirely plausible that the second game could be a new entry in The Last of Us series.</p><p>Druckmann shared the big news on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08x7kb5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press X to Continue podcast</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), stating: "There's another game that's being worked on at Naughty Dog where I'm in more of a producer role and I get to mentor, watch this other team, and give feedback and be the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump from one to the next makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I’m never bored."</p><p>The creative director also clarified that he is currently working on Intergalactic alongside two other Naughty Dog directors, Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau, and co-writer Clair Carré. VGC noted this means that Naughty Dog still has two other prominent game directors who are currently unattached to any of its announced projects: Shaun Escayg (Uncharted: The Lost Legacy) and Anthony Newman (The Last of Us: Part II).</p><p>Though it is possible that the studio could be hard at work on a new IP, all signs point to Druckmann's unannounced game being The Last of Us Part III. After all, Naughty Dog has stated it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">no plans to continue the Uncharted series</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/85465867?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prominent video game leakers</a> have hinted that the game is in development for quite some time now.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">recent remarks</a> from HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin have only fueled these rumors. Following the show being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">renewed for a third season</a>, Mazin stated that a fourth season will "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">be essential,</a>" which is curious considering the current pacing of the television series and how much source material remains. This paired with the fact that Mazin <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">previously said</a> he will not take the HBO show "past the game" make it seem like it's only a matter of time until The Last of Us Part III is announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-spawns-unfair-labor-practice-charge-from-voice-union/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>For voice actors who previously portrayed Darth Vader in video games, the Fortnite feature starkly illustrates how AI voice synthesis could reshape their profession. While James Earl Jones created the iconic voice for films, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Star-Wars/Darth-Vader/">at least 54 voice actors</a> have performed as Vader in various media games over the years when Jones wasn't available—work that could vanish if AI replicas become the industry standard.</p>
<h2>The union strikes back</h2>
<p>SAG-AFTRA's labor complaint (which can be read online <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">here</a>) doesn't focus on the AI feature's technical problems or on permission from the Jones estate, which <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">explicitly authorized</a> the use of a synthesized version of his voice for the character in Fortnite. The late actor, who died in 2024, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">signed over</a> his Darth Vader voice rights before his death.</p>
<p>Instead, the union's grievance centers on labor rights and collective bargaining. In the NLRB filing, SAG-AFTRA alleges that Llama Productions "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite."</p>
<p>The action comes amid SAG-AFTRA's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/interactive-media-video-game-strike">ongoing interactive media strike</a>, which began in July 2024 after negotiations with video game producers stalled primarily over AI protections. The strike continues, with more than 100 games signing interim agreements, while others, including those from major publishers like Epic, remain in dispute.</p>

It feels like we've only just been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">introduced to Naughty Dog's sci-fi action-adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, but studio boss Neil Druckmann has now confirmed there's a second game in development at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann shared the news in <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8721579-the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-talks-to-press-x">conversation with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, explaining that alongside Intergalactic - where's he's serving as writer and creative director - "there's another game that's being worked on at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> where I am more of a producer role."
</p>
<p>
"And I get to mentor and watch this other team, and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room," he continued. "I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored."

<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard multiple games are in development at Naughty Dog; the studio said it had "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game" in the works back in 2023, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>. Druckmann's latest statement is, however, the first confirmation since then that multiple projects are still underway.
</p>
<p>
As to what this second project might be, Druckmann offered no hints, but it's possible it's being helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-the-lost-legacy">Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</a> director Shaun Escayg - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-creative-director-moves-back-to-naughty-dog">rejoined Naughty Dog back in 2021</a> after serving as creative director on Crystal Dynamics' Marvel Avengers.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">teasing a third The Last of Us game</a> in recent years, but he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">seemingly backtracked on that in March</a>, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more." For now, his main focus appears to be Intergalactic, which is currently expected to arrive in 2027. And while details on the game are currently limited, Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-actor-lands-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-role-after-impressing-neil-druckmann-on-set">named another actor who's been cast in Intergalactic</a> after their appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">The Last of Us' television show</a>.

These include a wrap, a pickaxe, a back bling, and the full outfit. However, these specific items are locked behind XP benchmarks, which players can earn in any Fortnite mode. To unlock the ability to buy all of the items, you'll need to amass 1,280,000 XP. Depending on how committed to grinding out XP you are and the modes you play, this will likely take at least several hours of gameplay to earn.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-shonen-anime-fights-toxic-masculinity.1193478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a love/hate relationship with shonen anime. On the one hand, I love the fights and the action. On the other hand, I feel like so much focus on fights and action can breed toxic ideas about masculinity, with few shows examining what it really means to be “the strongest” beyond physical strength and power scaling debates. <em>Wind Breaker</em> restored my faith in the genre by showing that strength can be&nbsp;something more than just physical prowess.</p><p><em>Wind Breaker</em>, created by Satoru Nii and animated by CloverWorks, is basically what would happen if the <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-hawaii-yakuza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yakuza </em>games</a> were made into an anime. The series follows a group of rival gangs whose diverse archetypes of delinquent boys beef over turf, where the only adults appear to be the local business owners in the fictional Tokyo shopping district of Makochi.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wind Breaker</em>’s story follows the new kid on the block, Haruka Sakura, who quickly gets involved in the gangsta life after enrolling in Furin High School and joining up with its titular gang, Bofurin. Each high school gang has its captains, lieutenants, and foot soldiers, but rather than shake down neighborhoods for money, Bofurin acts as its town’s protectors from rival gangs running amok — basically how <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma</a> fashions himself as the stalwart protector of Kamurocho. The show’s secret sauce isn’t its action, though the action is <em>incredible</em>. It's how the show redefines masculinity through brotherhood and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THIS is How You Introduce an MC 😤 | WIND BREAKER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q7iAdbi684?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While the “power of friendship” anime trope has often been reduced to the usually half-baked and understated emotional fuel for fights, <em>Wind Breaker</em> flips the script. Instead of feeling obligatory or stale, its portrayal of brotherhood is earnest, nuanced, and genuinely impactful, seamlessly woven into both the action and development of its characters.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, Sakura is a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tsundere</a> — a character who has difficulty expressing his feelings. Much of his emotionally restrained disposition stems from him being bullied in the past for having dual hair colors and bright eyes, which folks assumed he did as a cry for attention instead of being his natural color. So instead of talking through matters, he settles disagreements by throwing hands — making him a division one draft pick to join the ranks of Bofurin’s kick ass gang. However, folks around the town, most notably, Bofurin gang’s resident big sis, Kotoha Tachibana, clock the soft boi nature not so subtly hiding under Sakura’s tough-guy demeanor, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwv8rTN9r00&amp;pp=ygUZY3J1bmNoeXJvbGwgd2luZCBicmVha2Vycw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely tease him</a>, causing him to blush tomato red whenever they catch him in the act of pushing down his feelings. However, their teasing isn’t to discourage him but to get the kid to stop bottling up his emotions and loosen up around his bros and throw punches at his toxic masculinity as hard as his foes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sakura's Heart Grew 3 Sizes That Day | WIND BREAKER Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwv8rTN9r00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Rather than use the power of friendship as a tepid story beat to ferry viewers to the next high-octane fight scene, <em>Wind Breaker</em> challenges the traditional ideas of masculinity by enriching its narrative with an emotional depth that speaks to the power of friendship, acceptance, and community as story’s lifeblood. Learning how to express your feelings is what keeps the story pumping, not just leaving rival gangs in a bloody heap. This is all too refreshing considering that anime, like gaming, has become an unchecked playground for the male loneliness epidemic that leads folks to dive headfirst into red-pill manosphere ideologies for the answer to why they don’t feel accepted in society.&nbsp;</p><p>While season one’s climactic fight, a turf war brawl between Bofurin and a rival gang, KEEL, culminated in a beautiful display of “just talk” among the rival gang about their brotherly drifting apart, episode 18 (“A Place I Belong”) hit the ground running by toning down the action and letting genuine comradery serve as the antidote to toxic masculinity. Off the heels of a gang battle, Sakura is in the dumps, feeling he could’ve done more to help his friends. Adding to his man pain is his being sick and not wanting his friends and fellow gang members to come check up on him. His friends inevitably break down his walls and get him to be embarrassed about his feelings and accept them head-on.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sakura Laughs??? | WIND BREAKER Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubvfZeF2IK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2><em>Wind Breaker </em>also has that good queer representation</h2><p>“A Place I Belong” and its follow-up episode, “Hidden Feelings,” perfectly dovetail into the show’s continued combating of toxic masculinity by segueing into the official introduction of the show’s best character, <a href="https://wind-breaker.fandom.com/wiki/Tasuku_Tsubakino" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsubaki-chan</a>, the anime’s gender nonconforming character and one of <a href="https://wind-breaker.fandom.com/wiki/The_Four_Kings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bofurin’s four kings</a>. When Tsubaki (whose official pronouns are he/him) first meets Sakura, he’s taken aback by Sakura complimenting him on his style. Given Bofurin’s full-throated acceptance of Tsubaki-chan, the compliment isn’t rare. But it’s wholesome to see it, given that Sakura just went through the lesson of accepting himself, insecurities and all.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>After going through the anime hijinks of being stunned by Tsubaki presenting as a girl in the otherwise macho group of teenagers, where other anime would embellish in misgendering for low-hanging fruit jokes, <em>Wind Breaker</em> takes an earnest and no-big-deal approach by having the whole gang treat Tsubaki-chan as an inalienable part of their crew. They even poke fun at him for having an obvious crush on their leader, Hajime Umemiya — a crush he’s also aware of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Hidden Feelings” acts as a backstory for Tsubaki-chan learning to accept his love for cute things in middle school and dressing more femininely with the encouragement of a senior couple (one of the rare instances adults rear their heads in the show). It is also a prescient vibe check for the series in terms of how far it is willing to go to represent these themes of self acceptance. Where other shows would make you read between the lines, <em>Wind Breaker</em> makes this subtext textual by having its senior characters outwardly state gender affirming remarks while applying Tsubaki-chan’s makeup, as he accepts himself as a person who likes cute things over the traditionally masculine.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Why <em>Wind Breaker</em> is necessary in today’s shonen anime landscape&nbsp;</h2><p>Much like gaming, the anime fandom struggles with a vocal minority that perpetuates toxic masculinity. These voices often elevate shonen anime solely for its fanservice and action sequences, treating them as the ultimate markers of quality, or “peak” anime. In their obsession with power fantasies, they sideline deeper narratives, reducing complex stories to flashy battles. This narrow perspective dismisses the emotional depth and thematic richness of anime and reinforces a rigid, exclusionary view of what the medium should be.&nbsp;</p><p>This issue is compounded by how legacy media’s anime coverage often reduces the medium to shonen as its defining genre, presenting it as the only thing worth engaging with in guides and recommendations. But shonen is only the tip of the iceberg of what anime offers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-fantasy-anime-frieren-review-madhouse-1850884841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</a> is a shonen that explores the survivor's guilt of a virtually immortal elf as she learns to appreciate the beauty in the mundanity of human life. <em>Nana</em> and its spiritual successor, <em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn't A Guy At All,</em> are girls’ comics (also known as shojo) that follow two women's journey of <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-discovery and love</a> through their shared love of music.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trope of “might equals right” frequently overshadows more meaningful themes, like the power of friendship, which, rather than serving as a rich emotional core, is often reduced to a generic connective tissue for its fights — something fans either overlook or rush past to clip bombastic fights that follow emotional breakthroughs. This narrow lens limits the engagement with anime’s depth and fuels a strange cultural phenomenon in online spaces that misses the plot entirely.</p><p>Platforms like the born-again right-wing cesspool Twitter have emboldened the very anime avatar crowd people used to avoid like the plague—the ones who twist media discourse into reactionary grifts, rallying against “wokeness” while paradoxically claiming deep allegiance to shonen staples like <a href="https://x.com/you_are_gay6969/status/1896294141996544373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/altades_art/status/1906847391837229155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Trigun</em></a>. The irony of their vitriolic rhetoric is striking because these series embody ideals of justice, compassion, and defiance against oppression—the principles they seem to reject. In their hands, shonen anime isn’t a medium to appreciate but a weaponized tool in a larger, dumber, ideological battle antithetical to the causes its heroes champion.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bon-chan! | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_K63IovR2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It doesn’t help that prominent anime content creators, such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/1j2sb3r/connor_talks_about_the_trash_taste_episode_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trash Taste crew</a>, often avoid taking a stance when confronted with their fan base’s hostility toward discussions about the inherent political themes in anime. Case in point, their announcement that they’d no longer feature Twitch streamer <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-twitch-ban-rick-scott-medicare-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasan “Hasanabi” Piker</a> on the podcast on March 3, after they <a href="https://x.com/HasPause/status/1896453220572221539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received backlash</a> over him correctly calling <a href="https://kotaku.com/hasan-piker-one-piece-socialist-twitch-youtube-politics-1850295738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em> correctly socialist</a>. By choosing neutrality, they reinforce the misconception that anime lacks political intent, allowing reactionary voices to dominate the conversation and reshape anime discourse in their image (ironically for right-wing ends).&nbsp;</p><p>By refusing to engage with what Piker was saying, these content creators further obfuscate the rich, intentional storytelling of series like One Piece. This distorts the medium into a matter of debate over <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mistranslations”</a> when fans point out its political messaging and gender-affirming themes. <em>Wind Breaker</em> bucks every opportunity for misconceptions by laying its stance on toxic masculinity and acceptance bare for all to see. That’s so fucking refreshing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>Wind Breaker </em>is sweet, endearing, and quietly revolutionary. It proves that masculinity isn’t about rigid roles as a stoic protector. It’s about genuine connection, unwavering acceptance, and fighting for (and alongside) the people you cherish. I hope that <em>Wind Breaker</em>’s Sakura and Tsubaki will serve as a gateway for anime fans who mainline shonen to try out shows from other genres like seinen and shojo that also explore gender expression to greater depths — anime like <em>Paradise Kiss</em>, <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Skip and Loafer</em>, and manga like <em>Boys Run the Riot</em>. If a shonen anime can pull off that feat, I think the kids will be alright.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk"><h3>The Hundred Line’s Darumi Amemiya Is Mortifying And I Will Defend Her With My Life</h3></a><p>Never before has a character been as embarrassing to be around and while being so relatable</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The anticipated collection based on the beloved RPG (my personal 2023 GOTY) launched in April, and some buyers noticed that the characters look nothing — and I mean <em>nothing </em>— like how they were advertised. These cursed recreations of Shadowheart, Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Wyll, and Lae’zel look like unlicensed knockoffs when they are, in fact, officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast. And, it costs $50 for the set!</p><p>Anyone who has played the game, or at least seen its cover art numerous times, knows what these characters should look like.

It’s a beautiful moment that is ripped right out of the <em>Last of Us Part II</em> video game, and the show does it justice. But fans who have played the game will know that this segment had a bit more to it originally. It’s only natural that the TV show, with its shorter run time, would have to cut some scenes down, but the wild thing is that it looks like HBO actually shot the rest of the segment and just didn’t use it in the final edit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This section of the game depicts Ellie’s 16th birthday. Joel knows she has a fixation on space and dinosaurs, so what better way to make her big day one to remember than by taking her to a museum that spotlights both? In the game you find a huge dinosaur exhibit on the bottom floor, and after you’ve explored that one, there’s another section dedicated to space travel waiting for you upstairs. Ellie is ecstatic exploring both floors, with the highlight being when she enters a spacecraft and listens to a recording of a pre-apocalyptic NASA launch so she can imagine what it might’ve been like to get off this ruined rock. It’s an incredibly sweet moment sandwiched between a lot of violence and heartache.</p><p>The show, meanwhile, only has one of these floors. We see Joel and Ellie mess around with a solar system diorama and pretend to be astronauts, but we miss the section where Ellie spouts off cool dinosaur facts and puts a hat on their skeletons. Ultimately, if you have to pick one or the other, the spaceship is the more important moment and the one worth showing the TV audience. But, wildly enough, it looks like Pascal and Ramsey shot scenes on a recreation of the dinosaur floor that never made their way into the episode. In the behind-the-scenes featurette for the episode, we can see footage of the actors and crew on the dinosaur floor, complete with all the overgrowth, grit, and grime you’d expect in a place that has been mostly abandoned for decades.</p><p>Fans are sad to see the set but none of the scenes that took place in it. Maybe we’ll see some deleted scenes in the special features whenever the season two box set is released. Who among us doesn’t want to see Ramsey putting a cowboy hat on Pascal as he grimaces and lightly protests? Don’t deny me this, HBO.</p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>has one more episode this season, but it won’t be the end of the show’s take on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story, as HBO is stretching it out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Company is taking complaints "seriously."</p>

            <p>
Board game company WizKids has apologised for its recent line of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> miniatures, acknowledging the melty faced monstrosities "missed the mark" and offering full refunds.
</p>
<p>
WizKids announced the range - officially known as Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Icons Of The Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 - at the end of last year, and US customers began receiving their £50/$49.99, seven-character sets earlier this month. However, rather than the crisply detailed renditions of Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Lae'zel and Withers featured in WizKids' promotional material, customers instead received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1ko1rb6/apparently_bg3_miniatures_from_wizkids_started_to/">pre-painted miniatures that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Borja church fresco</a> - and complaints were swift.
</p>
<p>
And now, with more and more images of the squishy faced disappointments being shared online, WizKids has been forced to concede that, yes, its Baldur's Gate 3 miniatures are in fact rubbish. "As a company, WizKids seeks to create products that enhance and add to the enjoyment of game play," it wrote <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">on its website</a>. "We want our customers to build long-lasting, fond memories around game nights with friends and family using our products."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with the D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 Character Boxed Set," it continued. "If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set... We're aware of the recent reports and complaints and are taking them seriously. Our team is currently investigating these issues and taking action to make this right for those whose purchases were negatively affected and to ensure these issues do not recur in future products and reprints."
</p>
<p>
WizKids notes anyone who purchased the box set from a third-party retailer should contact them directly for a refund, while those wishing for a replacement - one that "meets the standards expected" - can do so <a href="https://win.wizkids.com/replacements/">via its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers," WizKids concluded. "We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner. Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this. We appreciate your patience as we focus on getting back to those affected and helping them with their refunds in a timely manner."
</p>
<p>
It's hardly a fitting celebration of developer Larian's acclaimed 2023 RPG, but with the studio's work on the game now largely at an end following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">April's massive Patch 8</a>, Astarion, Karlach, and friends are now entirely at Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Hasbro's mercy. And if that means licensing them out to be turned into unrecgonsisable bits of plastic, then so be. Hasbro has, of course, already confirmed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">keen to find a studio to make Baldur's Gate 4</a>, but with Larian now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-says-studio-didnt-do-dlc-because-it-was-the-boring-option">working on its own mysterious projects</a>, it's unclear how far off that may be.

The complaint stems from the company’s recent introduction of an AI programmed to sound like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader that can respond to a player’s actions and questions</a>.</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement that it understands its members and members’ estates wish to use AI technology in any way they choose. “However,” SAG-AFTRA’s statement continued, “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>While the AI “revolution” slowly replaces human workers with oftentimes inferior products, and despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">some members’ distaste for the practice</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23962349/sag-aftra-tentative-agreement-generative-artificial-intelligence-vote">SAG-AFTRA has embraced the idea of using AI</a> trained to replicate an actor’s performance. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283240/sag-aftra-has-announced-an-agreement-with-ethovox-which-is-building-a-foundational-ai-model-for-voic">established contracts and partnerships with several AI companies</a> with the idea being members can use this technology with specific contract-guaranteed protections. So the act of using an AI to replace Darth Vader’s voice performers (both the late James Earl Jones and those brought in after his death to match his performance) isn’t what SAG-AFTRA is objecting to. Rather, it’s the fact that this was done without Epic Games sitting down with SAG-AFTRA at the bargaining table to hash out the specifics. </p><p>“<em>Fortnite</em>’s signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with AI technology,” SAG-AFTRA wrote. “Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">AI and its use in video game voice and motion performance</a> is the main stumbling block in the ongoing video game voice actor strike. Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the signatory companies of its interactive media agreement broke down last year, and performers have been on strike since July — a length of time that eclipses both the actors and writers strikes of 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In this video, we also get our closest look yet at Switch 2 game cards. While they look pretty similar in size and shape to original Switch cards, they are almost entirely bright red--making them immediately visually distinct from the slate-gray cards of the previous console.

<p>The carrying case, which <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-123697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes for $40 on Nintendo's store</a>, has a flip-down flap that appears to have snug slots to hold up to six games. It also has a zipper pocket, which is shown storing Joy-Con wrist straps.</p><p>Nintendo has been steadily rolling out additional details about the upcoming console on the Nintendo Today app. Last week, for instance, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-controllers-gl-gr-buttons-are-more-customizable-than-we-thought/1100-6531549/" data-ref-id="1100-6531549">Switch 2's new GL/GR buttons will be mappable on a per-game basis</a>, providing players additional control customization in comparison to the original Switch. In addition, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/" data-ref-id="1100-6531631">a number of helpful accessibility features</a> coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">the new GameChat functionality</a>.</p><p>Switch 2 launches on June 5, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders quickly sold out</a> and have since been widely unavailable in the US. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">Nintendo has said that its higher price point</a> may suppress early adoption, although it is still expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 consoles in the 2026 fiscal year</a>.</p>

It's not the first time that we've seen a pretty stacked lineup of games for the brand, and if you're on PC, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+8+Xbox+Game+Studios+Hits+For+Only+%2410+This+Week&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6531624&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fxbox-games-studio-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-xbox-game-studios-hits-for-only-10-this-week%2F1100-6531624%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab eight Xbox Game Studios PC games for only $10</a></strong> from Humble Bundle right now. You'll want to be quick, though, because <strong>this deal expires on May 24</strong>. Each game here will be provided as a key that can be redeemed on your Steam account.</p><p>The Xbox Games Studio bundle includes several blockbusters with a few titles that might have escaped your notice. You've got Remedy's fascinating blend of scripted TV and time-bending action in Quantum Break alongside the interactive drama As Dusk Falls, as an example. Another highlight here is Sunset Overdrive, a cheeky response to the deluge of cover-based shooters doing the rounds back in the early 2010s and developed by Insomniac Games, a studio that has since gone on to establish itself as the developer behind the best Spider-Man games.</p><p>Strategy game fans can also pick up Age of Empires: Definitive Edition for an impressively upgraded tour of history, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a tightly constructed metroidvania with soul-stirring art, and Broken Age is a puzzle-filled adventure game from Brutal Legend developer Double Fine. You can grab the Battletoads remake as well for a surprisingly solid action-adventure featuring a trio of weird heroes named after terrible skin conditions. Up to three players can battle it out, and the game has a lovely hand-crafted art direction.</p><p>Like other Humble Bundle deals, proceeds will go toward charity. Humble partnered with Gameheads for this bundle. Gameheads is a tech training organization focused on teaching game development skills to people from all walks of life.</p><h2>More Humble Bundle deals</h2><p>A few other bundle deals are also available right now.

Less refined but also more linear than its successor, the second game in the trilogy still tells a gripping story of magic fables and grim politicking across a much less overwhelming map. You can get in and out in just 25 hours if you want, with smaller zones to explore and fewer RPG systems to tinker with, but still tons of great story scenes and character writing. </p><p><em>The Witcher 1</em> is also decent in its own way, though it’s much <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-first-witcher-game-has-not-aged-well-1840835219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-witcher-game-has-not-aged-well-1840835219">more of an acquired taste</a></span>. Some still swear by it but I’ve found the fiddly menus, archaic controls, and opaque directions a chore to muddle through, even if the storytelling lays necessary groundwork for the sequels and goes to places you only ever hear about in the latest game. At just $1.50, though, there’s really no reason not to scoop it up with the rest.

With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> coming in hot, many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-9">Black and White</a>-era cards are suddenly on every collector’s radar again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing massive jumps on cards that have sat stable for years, all because Gen V is back in style. If you're looking to trade, cash in, or just gawk at how weird card prices can get, I’ve got you covered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are five cards that are flying and five that are faceplanting. Some of these are smart buys. Others? Let’s say I wouldn’t want to be the one who paid full price three weeks ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t121910-653-1747567332953.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1XAY?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex from Prismatic Evolutions</a> dropped 21% since mid-April, from $467.85 to $369.96. Still expensive, sure, but that's a big chunk of change to evaporate in just a few weeks. If you bought high, I’m sorry. If not, maybe give it a few more dips before you pounce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJw3Y?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex</a>, also from Prismatic. Down 28%, now sitting at $172 after peaking above $240. Honestly, I think Eeveelution fatigue is real. There are just so many of them floating around that even good cards are struggling to keep their value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3O8W?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Clefairy ex from Journey Together</a> has slid 26% this month, from $212 to $158. I still like this card a lot, but the dip is noticeable. Early adopters probably paid more than they should have, and now the market's correcting like it just remembered what money is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg5oM?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> is rough. It's down a staggering 63% since late March, from $242 to $90.50. That’s not a correction, that’s a full-on crash landing. I wouldn’t be shocked if it dips further. Might be worth watching, but I wouldn’t touch it yet unless you’re in it for the art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, we’ve got <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgM8w?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex from Prismatic</a>, down 19% just this month. It was sitting around $84 and is now at $67.75. That’s not terrible, but it’s still part of a clear trend. The set had a big debut and now the shine is fading fast.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t122002-296-1747567351556.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll start with <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4wAW?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reshiram from Black &amp; White</a>, which has absolutely rocketed. It was sitting at a modest $33.92 in mid-March, and now you’re lucky to find one under $240. That’s a 150% leap for a card that’s over a decade old. I’ve seen faster elevators, but not many. With all 156 Unova Pokémon getting fresh prints soon, I think Reshiram’s still got room to climb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwLO3?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom EX from Next Destinies</a>, which has gone from $34.63 to nearly $392 since March. It’s another reminder that Full Art cards from the EX era aren’t just collectible, they’re volatile. In a good way, if you got in early. I’d still grab this if it fits your binder, because it's only going to get more attention once White Flare drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also watching <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKvjX?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sprigatito from Paldea Evolved</a>. The IR version has quietly crept up from $17.98 in January to $21.95 today. It’s not a moonshot, but compared to the general slump of modern IRs, it’s doing surprisingly well. Plus, it’s a smug little cat and people love smug cats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbdJe?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dialga-GX from Forbidden Light</a>. This one was hanging out around $14 just two months ago, and it’s shot up to $74.99. I wouldn’t call it graceful, but it’s definitely gaining traction. GX-era cards are getting more attention lately, and Dialga's age plus playable nostalgia make it a solid hold in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t laugh, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJgO1?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vileplume-GX from Cosmic Eclipse</a> is up too. It was stuck at $6.83 for what felt like forever, and now it’s over $10. It’s not exactly a gold rush, but it’s one of those oddball rares that sneaks up when no one’s looking. You’ll thank yourself later if you pull it out of a bulk box and it suddenly pays for lunch.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><div catalogid="0fe4ac08-2aeb-4f0f-834e-a41eccfc1ee1" id="221171"><div id="221171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>151 Booster Pack</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Dropped by 8% since beginning of May</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unless you're dead set on grabbing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAwMx?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">promo cards and poster in the 151 poster bundle</a>, grabbing booster packs from TCG Player is where it's at (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJwZV?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Or just the poster and promos seperately</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently sitting at $10.33 a pack, it's obvious that Amazon is now going above MSRP and secondary market value.

                <p>It wasn't that long ago that Xbox Series X|S owners could only use official Microsoft controllers for wireless play. Outside of modded options from brands like Scuf, the Xbox Wireless Controller and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2 Controllers</a> were the only choices. And while Microsoft's official controllers are quite good, it's always nice to have different models to choose from. So it was a great development when Microsoft opened its wireless protocol to licensed manufacturers. Over the past two years, the market for wireless third-party Xbox controllers has actually become a bit crowded. The latest notable Elite Series 2 challenger to enter the pro-style controller ring is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited</a>.</p><div title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3531" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox &amp; PC Wireless Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><p>The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited has a bevy of premium features, including numerous physical modifications and input customization options.

Though the latest member of the Revolution lineup has some familiar features--the interchangeable weights, for instance--the Revolution X Unlimited does have components not found on Revolution 5 Pro. Most notably, the Xbox edition adds a built-in LCD display and has two swappable D-pads--the Revolution 5 Pro has a custom fighting game-centric D-pad.</p><p>The built-in customization screen is a handy feature that we've seen in a few other controllers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach's Stealth Ultra</a>. It works well, allowing you to remap inputs and create custom profiles. If you plug a wired headset into the 3.5mm audio jack, you can tinker with the EQ settings and game/chat balance directly on the controller. I found the onboard controls helpful since the Revolution X Unlimited software app for Xbox and PC is a bit buggy at the moment, especially on Xbox, where the app crashed while trying to adjust settings. On the flip side, I didn't run into any problems while using the built-in screen.</p><p>In terms of feel, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited accomplishes the task of <em>feeling </em>like a high-end controller. The Hall Effect sticks have a smooth, precise range of motion, and the microswitch face buttons are quick and deliver satisfying feedback. The weighting system is one of the coolest features, especially since part of the reason why Microsoft's Elite Series 2 feels so good is because of its weight distribution. The Revolution X Unlimited's textured grips on the back of the handles can be popped off to switch between the three different weight sets, allowing users to find their preferred "heftiness."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318"></a><figcaption>Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Controller for Xbox/PC/Android</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png"></figure><p>The only aspect of the Revolution X Unlimited that I've found very difficult to get accustomed to is the unique shape and placement of the remappable back buttons. The lower pair of back buttons are shaped like right triangles and positioned near the bottom of the handles. The upper pair of buttons are quadrilateral with irregular sides.</p><p>The shapes are peculiar, but the low placement is what makes them feel quite different compared to many pro-style controllers with back buttons. Typically, my middle and ring fingers naturally rest on the back buttons of similar controllers, including the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro for Xbox/PC</a></strong>. With the Revolution X Unlimited, my normal hand placement set my ring and pinky fingers on the back buttons, which felt awkward. As such, I had to shift my grip downward slightly. If you're used to other pro-style controllers with four back buttons, the Revolution X Unlimited likely won't be easy to use at first. Even after testing it for a few weeks, I still find the layout to be disorienting.</p><p>Outside of the back button placement--which could <i>maybe </i>be more comfortable for players with larger hands--the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited's feature set and components are solid. Along with the adjustable weights, it comes with six rubberized stick caps, two pairs of resistance rings for the sticks, two metal D-pads, a charging stand, and a nice hardshell carrying case to hold everything. It also benefits from adjustable trigger locks, two extra shoulder buttons, and immersive rumble thanks to motors located in both the handles and triggers.</p><p>If the back buttons were more conventional, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited might have eclipsed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/" data-ref-id="1100-6526158">Wolverine V3 Pro as my favorite Elite Series 2 alternative</a>. If you think the back buttons on the Elite Series 2 and other controllers are too close together or located too high, the Revolution X Unlimited might work out well for you. That said, if you're anything like me, you may wind up viewing it as a controller with only two back buttons--I have abandoned the bottom two buttons and only sparingly use the other two. Considering back buttons are arguably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about pro-style controllers, this potential concession is a big one.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited is available now for $200</a>, the same MSRP as the Wolverine V3 Pro and the Elite Series 2 following Microsoft's recent price increase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Some characters torment you simply with their presence. Often this is because they are irritating or embarrassing. Darumi Amemiya from <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a masterclass in being annoying: a creature so debased and overflowing with cringe that I want to shoot her out of a cannon, yet so endearingly true that I will defend her with every fiber of my being. I loathe and love my cringe daughter.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a collaboration between <em>Danganronpa</em> creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape</em> creator Kotaro Uchikoshi. Both series are visual novel adventure games, and both games feature a labyrinthine, twisting narrative with a bunch of idiosyncratic anime characters trapped in a deadly space by a mysterious creature or person.</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the game. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Kotaro Uchikoshi’s storytelling tends towards the existential. He peppers his narratives with heavy handed philosophical, sci-fi and game theory ideas while making aggressive use of branching ergodic narrative structure. Kazutaka Kodaka is far more lurid, gleefully leaning heavily into the debased, violent nature of <em>Danganronpa’s</em> “killing game” premise. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, somehow, represents the perfect synthesis of these tones, a “Dueling Banjos” of two of the most distinct narrative voices in Japanese game development that understands and anticipates the player’s expectations from these two authors.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Though still very much a visual novel, <em>The Hundred Line </em>is also a tactical game in the vein of <em>Fire Emblem</em>. Humanity has been living in some kind of protected bunker when it’s invaded by malicious creatures. After a brief fight the main character, Takumi Sukimo, wakes up in The Last Defense Academy at the behest of a strange, mascot-like entity named Sirei, who looks as if a ghost had legs, a hat, a little bow tie and a visible brain. They are told that their blood is special, compatible with a substance called “Hemoanima” that allows them to self-harm henshin <em>Persona</em>-style by plunging a special knife into their chest and unlocking heretofore unknown powers. They also are told they are functionally immortal on school grounds, allowed to be revived should they fall in battle. I’m still working through the game, and it’s reported that there are 100 distinct endings, although I don’t know if anybody has gotten all of them.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop talking about her favorite niche porno games. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the students in <em>The Hundred Line</em> is a nasty little freak in a distinct and unique way that interacts with how they behave on the battlefield. For example there’s Takemaru, the aggressive, Bōsōzoku-style biker, who becomes a cavalry unit on the battlefield that benefits from distance traveled. Tsubasa the pretty mechanic has a stress reaction that makes her vomit; Shouma is a tiny meek child who looks like a turtle; the Tsukomos can only be described as “the incest twins.” And while each cast member has their foibles, none compare to the queen: Darumi Amemiya.</p><figure><figcaption>Here she Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>When you meet Darumi, she is so aggressively off-putting you are not quite sure what to make of her. Her hair looks like if Hatsune Miku let her roots grow out for several months because she was depressed, and she’s wearing edgelord Heath Ledger Joker makeup. Her outfit looks like a car crash of ‘00s American emo culture and trashy Japanese street fashion: a striped fuku covered in punk patches and gargantuan safety pins. She is annoyingly morbid, a self-loathing Yandere goth who canonically has <a href="https://x.com/Jabberwocky2469/status/1912858379867079009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bipolar disorder</a> according to co-director Akihiro Togawa.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop doing the puppygirl bit. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Darumi constantly rants about doing harm to herself and others, and is obsessed with gory media and eroge. Darumi will frequently name drop her favorite erotic games, forcing your character to play them should you interact with her, often in ways that foreshadow narrative events in the game. It gives me no pleasure to admit that she has frankly fantastic taste in the genre.</p><p>Her obsession with “killing games” is by far the funniest aspect of her character. She is clearly a stand-in for the audience and is probably the most well-adjusted <em>Danganronpa </em>fan in history. On some level you can hear Kodaka lovingly shoving her in your face and saying “See this? This is what you guys all sound like.” If you fall into that category, it’s quite clear that he got your ass.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi is prone to sudden mood swings. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Even outside of the meta context of the game, it is impossible for the intended audience of the work to not experience regular bouts of mortification from everything that she says. In Japanese she is voiced by Fairouz Ai (better known as the voice of Jolyene in <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>) while Sarah Pritard voices her English. Both do a fantastic job at rendering her character in ways distinct to their context, although Pritard’s performance is particularly brutal for anybody who came of age during the aughts. Because her character is almost eternal at this point, it is hard not for me to project my own millennial context on her.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Cut that out Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>In Darumi, I see both myself and the many cringe women and gay men I knew in middle and high school. She is an emo scenester, insecure, the kind of girl who would get way too into <em>Johnny The Homicidal Maniac</em> and have full zip up <em>Invader Zim</em> GIR pajamas. She is a walking Hot Topic despite thinking herself above that, someone who I could see owning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi_paddle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoi paddle</a>. I knew, and on some level was, a person like this: full of self-loathing and overly effusive, swinging between the far ends of depression and uncontrollable excitement, burying myself in extreme and transgressive fiction and externalizing pain as a means of hiding it. And though the cast of <em>The Hundred Line </em>is initially abrasive, the game does its best to sell even the most depraved and cartoonish student, attempting and often succeeding at giving them depth and pathos. After the initial shock, it is hard not to care for Darumi like a good friend, a sibling or child.</p><figure><figcaption>I know this is the localization but I still think it's appropriate. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Darumi is a walking disaster, an aggressively insistent indoor kid who continues to grow on you, and though she may be cringe, she is also a funhouse mirror into the soul of the intended audience of this game. To be annoyed with her when she pretends to be a weird puppy girl is to be annoyed with your younger self, and to embrace her is to embrace that same. Thank you Darumi; you’re one of my favorite characters in recent memory. I will defend your honor in spite of (and often because of) the fact that you simply won’t shut the fuck up.</p><figure><figcaption>I have indeed been Darumi'd.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite.1193367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Llama Productions, an Epic Games subsidiary, over how it went about Fortnite's AI-voiced Darth Vader. The charge isn't being laid simply because Llama Productions and Epic used AI. Prior to his passing, James Earl Jones, the original voice for Darth Vader and a litany of other iconic roles, signed a deal with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23372640/star-wars-james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-retired-ai">Respeecher</a> to allow his archived voice-over work to be used in cases like this.</p>
<p>The charge from SAG-AFTRA comes from how Llama Productions went about using an AI version of Jones' voice. SAG-AFTRA is placing the charge because Llama Productions went the AI route "<em>without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms</em>," the organization says in a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games,</em>" SAG-AFTRA writes in its statement.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf"> actual filing</a>, the basis of the charge reads "<em>Within the past six months, the Employer [Llama Productions], by its agents and representatives, failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite</em>."</p>
<p>So it's not that generative AI was used to voice Darth Vader in Fortnite that SAG-AFTRA has a problem with, it's the fact that Llama Productions, by SAG's claims, completely went around SAG-AFTRA when working with Respeecher to bring the AI-version of James Earl Jones' voice to Fortnite.</p>
<p>As far as Jones' family is concerned, when AI Darth Vader was first showcased, his family released the following statement through Epic, saying "<em>James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character</em>."</p>
<p>Hours into AI Darth Vader being in Fortnite, players had been able to make him <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-epic-games-star-wars-james-earl-jones-2000603304">swear</a> and say <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/star-wars-ai-darth-vader-racial-slurs-774932-20250519">offensive slurs</a>.</p>
<p>The strike that SAG-AFTRA actors under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) called <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">last year</a> is still ongoing, and while it wouldn't have impacted games coming out in 2025 and even games in 2026, it will begin to impact future titles if a deal cannot be reached soon. SAG-AFTRA recently published a<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftras-interactive-media-agreement-negotiating-committee-responds-video-game-employers"> rebuttal</a> to the offer put forth by game studios, which, if SAG-AFTRA had signed, would have provided no generative AI protections for any performance that came before this new deal.</p>

			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a week ago, Sony has <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the action game Stellar Blade will debut on PC on June 11. However, it immediately became clear that even though the game did not require users to register for a PlayStation Network account, Stellar Blade was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unavailable for purchase in approximately 130 countries</a>.</p>
<p>South Korean developer Shift Up has commented on that issue and others, such as the criticized addition of the Denuvo DRM software, in a post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>. Regarding the region lock, they are working with Sony to remedy the situation; when it comes to Denuvo, they posted a table showing that the DRM software doesn't actually decrease frame rates when playing the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.</em></li>
<li><em>As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases. Mods are fully supported without any restrictions.</em></li>
<li><em>PSN connecting is entirely optional and NEVER required.</em></li>
<li><em>Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, many PC users are still doubtful&nbsp;<span>about the inclusion of Denuvo in Stellar Blade. In the past, the DRM software was involved in claims that it negatively affected performance, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-7-denuvo-drm-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Tekken 7</a>&nbsp;and, more recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-pc-stutters-go-away-with-the-crack-digital-foundry-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Resident Evil Village</a>. Other times, it turned out that </span>the anti-tamper software <a href="https://wccftech.com/denuvo-drm-doesnt-impact-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not responsible</a> for any performance decrease.</p>
<p>With only three weeks left before the launch, we won't have to wait long before learning how well Stellar Blade is optimized. The developer has made bold claims, though:</p>
<p><em>After extensive testing and relentless optimization, the game delivers high frame rates on a variety of setups. Even on the Steam Deck, you can reach 45–50 FPS with the right settings.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the game has climbed the best-selling chart on Steam with its pre-orders, making Shift Up very happy. Check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Stellar Blade PS5 review</a> to learn what we thought of the game when it first launched on Sony's console.</p>
