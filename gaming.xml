<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that it’s testing a new matchmaking system as a major quality-of-life improvement in Escape from Tarkov – and EFT: Arena. This testing is taking place on the ETS server, which is an early-access test environment restricted to a specific user base.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been made clear when these changes will hit the wider audience, but they sound solid at first blush.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-much-needed-changes">Much Needed Changes</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s matchmaking system has long been a thorn in the side of gamers worldwide. For instance, around an Escape from Tarkov wipe, which is the bi-annual global reset event, queues to get into a match can be dragged out monumentally, often hitting ten, fifteen, or more minutes to raid.</p>



<p>Many users have dealt with random disconnects and glitches during the matchmaking process over the years. One issue that surfaced this year was a problem with ‘Scav raids’, with players hitting never-ending loading screens during the matchmaking process.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1856691016960454986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main goal of the new system is to reduce the raid search time in Escape from Tarkov and matchmaking in EFT:Arena, as well as to reduce the number of errors and disconnects during matchmaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond matchmaking, another concern for users is the amount of time it takes to load the map and loot pools and to connect with other players before finally entering a raid. This is one of the reasons why so many people moved to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE ecosystem, as loading into a PvE raid can take as little as 20 or 30 seconds all-in.</p>

<p>Since 2022, PlayStation fans have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of a Horizon multiplayer game – and LEGO Horizon isn’t about to fill that gap anytime soon. It was claimed in September that Horizon’s multiplayer project is the next Guerrilla Games deliverable, <strong>not </strong>a ‘Horizon 3’.</p>



<p>Per a recent job listing, it looks as though the team will be preparing to release this live-service Horizon title in at least some form next year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-wild">Into the Wild</h2>



<p>It has been at least two years since the first reports of ‘Horizon Online’ surfaced. Since then, almost nothing has been divulged by either Guerrilla Games or insiders close to the project. In March 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-has-not-been-canceled-by-playstation/">Jason Schreier suggested</a> that the game hadn’t been shelved amid a restructuring effort at PlayStation, and in September, he outright claimed that Guerrilla’s next game is this multiplayer title.</p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/">leaks revealed</a> alpha footage from a multiplayer-based Horizon title, along with a little key concept art. This content revealed a unique direction for the game, which many claimed ‘looked like Fortnite’.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed users recently <a href="https://x.com/Jorraptor/status/1856757437006827810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up a job listing</a> for a ‘Release QA Intern’ at Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>In this listing, it’s mentioned that the successful candidate will be working on an ‘online project’ and that they’ll need to be available in ‘the first half of 2025’. In the listing’s description, it’s stated that they’ll help ‘to ensure the game is prepared for launch’.</p>



<p>If we assume that the QA period takes a fair bit of time to complete, we could be looking at a release window – or at least an early access window – of H2 2025. We almost know that this is a live-service multiplayer title, and it’s not uncommon that they’re released in an ‘unfinished’ or beta state.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a potential Horizon multiplayer game? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Embracer Group continues the restructuring efforts that have unravelled over the last year or two, divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a consideration of $1.2 billion. Per a press release, the ‘transaction has a strong strategic and financial rationale’.</p>



<p>Easybrain has been developing mobile apps for almost a decade, and since 2016, the developer has seen more than 1.5 billion downloads across its portfolio. Miniclip, on the other hand, is a mobile publisher founded more than 20 years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-changes">Making Changes</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-easybrain-to-miniclip-for-a-consideration-of-usd-1-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published today by Embracer Group, it was revealed that the firm is divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a tidy sum of £$1.2 billion.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lars Wingefors, the CEO of Embracer, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>This transaction transforms Embracer’s financial position and puts us in a stronger position to drive value. Easybrain has been an important part of the Embracer family for over three years, contributing to strong value creation during this time. As Easybrain’s market is transforming, Miniclip is the right strategic buyer to enable the company to stay at the forefront of the ad-driven mobile game industry.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saad Choudri, the CEO of Miniclip, echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We are delighted to welcome Easybrain to Miniclip. We have long admired Easybrain’s ability to build loyal and engaged puzzle game communities. The addition of evergreen franchises like Sudoku.com further reinforces our vision to engage a broad audience of players.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Easybrain’s CEO spoke of the future of the brand and starting a new chapter that will allow them to ‘deliver even more enriching experiences for players’. It’s expected that the transaction will close in the early months of 2025, with Miniclip securing the Easybrain label on a cash and debt-free basis.</p>

With plenty of potential allies to recruit around Hawaii and Madlantis, you’ll need to assemble your very own crew of misifts and raise them into legendary pirates!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Like-a-Dragon-Pirate-Yakuza-in-Hawaii_2024_11-14-24_024.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The Pirates’ Coliseum</strong></p><p>The Pirates’ Coliseum in Madlantis is an arena like no other.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-best-personality-for-the-hero-and-all-classes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, much like the original NES release and every other remake released over the years, features some very unique gameplay mechanics that have a rather big impact on character progression for every playable character. Among these is the Personality system, which the game uses to assign a personality to a character that determines stat growth on top of a class's natural growth.</p>
<p>You will be acquainted with this Personality system right at the beginning of the adventure. A mysterious voice will ask for your real name and birth date first before submitting you to a personality quiz, which involves a few questions picked at random among 43 possible questions. Depending on how you answer, you will be brought into an imaginary scenario where you will have to deal with one between eight different choices that will end up determining the personality of the Hero.</p>
<p>Given the huge number of possibilities and how the questions are picked out at random, it is difficult to aim for a certain personality. Depending on the questions and the final scenario, the Hero can belong to one of the 32 starting personalities. 13 other personalities are reserved for the companions.&nbsp; 28 of the 45 personalities can be assigned to any character using special items to give players more control over this unique gameplay system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241113123149_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for how the best personality in the entirety of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, the one that has the most benefits is the Vamp personality, formerly known as Sexy. This female-exclusive personality has a +70% stat bonus, allowing for great well-rounded characters that can be great at doing several different things and can take better advantage of the Vocation system that allows every character, with the exception of the Hero, to change classes once at Level 20 after having reached Alltrades Abbey a few hours into the adventure. Upon a class change, the level of the character is reset to 1 with all stats halved, but once a character that changed class levels up again, they will be more powerful than they were before the class change.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more specific builds that can take advantage of a class' unique abilities, there are some personalities that work better than others for all character types. For the Hero, who's made to be highly versatile, the Paragon personality works best for a physical attacker, Though Cookie for a tank with high physical defense, Wit for a spellcaster. Paragon and Tough Cookie work great for Warriors, while Lone Wolf, alongside Though Cookie, works great for the Martial Artist who wants to hit hard and fast. Mages, Priests, and Gadabouts that will turn into Sages benefit the most from Genius, although this personality could lead to a durability issue. Wit is a more balanced personality that provides good Wisdom growth without sacrificing durability too much. Thieves work well with Paragon for attack power and Tough Cookie for defense, depending on how you want to use them, although a physical attacker build works slightly better given their high agility growth that allows them to often attack before anyone else. Merchants leave a lot to be desired no matter their personality, so you could go with any and still have to deal with an average class that doesn't do anything particularly well. Learning a variety of different abilities, the new Monster Wrangler class is just as versatile as the Hero class, so the best personality depends on how you want to use the class. Paragon remains the best for a physically oriented build, and Wit for a spellcasting-oriented build.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241112185955_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While wrapping your head around the Personality system in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake can feel complicated at the start of the game, keep in mind that you can complete the adventure at any difficulty level using any party composition and with any personality. The system has been devised to give players almost complete control over their characters' growth and should be considered as a bonus mechanic rather than a fundamental one that has to be fully understood to complete the game. So, if you're not aiming to min-maxing, you can go with any personality or class and still have a great time.</p>

It’s a message that thanks fans for trying out Pokémon TCG Pocket since its launch a few weeks ago, and more importantly, it tells players what they can expect if they stick around. Update plans not only include new cards but even new, mysterious features that have yet to be announced.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone! Today, I'd like to share a brief statement by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team about more immediate updates coming to the game in the next few months.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more details with everyone as they become available! <a href="https://t.co/eaN35vRpSw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eaN35vRpSw</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket will receive at least one “major update” in the near future, with the team saying that the plans is to release new booster packs before the end of the year. Those who have picked up the Pokémon mobile game so far have been treated to three packs – Genetic Apex Mewtwo, Charizard, and Pikachu – with three pools of cards to choose from. It’s unclear exactly how many more packs will release in the next few months or which creatures they will feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How and when the card roster will grow remains a mystery, but one feature that has been on everyone’s minds is currently slated to arrive early next year: trading. The ability to trade cards with other players is a Social Hub menu option that’s been grayed out since launch, and in January, Pokémon TCG Pocket will finally make it available to use. It’s worth noting that today’s message clarifies that only “certain cards” will be available to trade at release, with the team promising to “expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the message keeps more than a few details hidden, rest assured that more features will come to Pokémon TCG Pocket down the line. “Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here,” the message says. “We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it.”</p><div id="best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3><h3>Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This mobile version of everyone’s favorite pocket monster trading card game has taken the world by storm since it launched late last month.

I’m Runhao Yao, producer of the <em>Nikki</em> series. I want to personally thank each of you for your continued support and patience. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that <em>Infinity Nikki</em> will officially release across multiple platforms on December 5—a date that holds special meaning for us. Twelve years ago, on this very day, we released our first game in the beloved <em>Nikki</em> series, <em>Nikki Up2U: A Dressing Story</em>. Now, our fifth <em>Nikki</em> game is finally ready to meet you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The first <em>Nikki</em> game was created by just a few of us, but today, the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> team has grown to more than one thousand people. Bringing this “one-of-a-kind” project to life has been challenging, with far more complexity in development and <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> than we ever anticipated. It’s been tough, but our determination carried us through. Our team has always believed in taking on the impossible, and because this was a <em>Nikki</em> project, we were even more motivated and inspired to pursue “infinity” with everything we had.</p><p>These last 12 years have been a long but precious journey for both the <em>Nikki</em> series and our team. Thank you to everyone who has played Nikki in the past, those who enjoy it now, and those who will join us in the future. If you’re planning to try <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, we hope it brings you joy.</p><p>—Runhao Yao, Producer</p></blockquote><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Infold Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> is the fifth installment in the beloved <em>Nikki</em> series developed by Infold Games. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5, this multi-platform, open-world dress-up adventure seamlessly blends the series’ core dress-up mechanics with open-world exploration elements. It also offers platforming, puzzle-solving, and many other gameplay elements to create a unique and rich experience.</p><p>In this game, Nikki and Momo embark on a new adventure to travel across the fantastical nations of Miraland, each with its own unique culture and environment. Players will encounter many characters and whimsical creatures while collecting stunning outfits of various styles. Some of these outfits possess magical abilities that are crucial for exploration.</p><p><strong>Whimsical Adventure with Endless Fun</strong></p><p>Harnessing the power of Whim that’s hidden within outfits, Nikki has the tools to help her overcome difficult trials. Her courage and determination know no bounds.</p><p>The Floating Outfit allows Nikki to hover gracefully, the Gliding Outfit summons a giant flower for high-altitude flights, and the Shrinking Outfit lets her sit on Momo’s head as he navigates through small spaces. These Ability Outfits open up many possibilities for adventure and thus offer an endless amount of fun!</p><p>In this vast, fantastical world, master techniques such as floating, running, and plunging to freely explore the land as well as tackle cleverly designed puzzles and levels. The joy of 3D platforming is interwoven throughout the game’s open-world exploration. Each unique scenery is vibrant and charming. Soaring paper cranes, speeding wine cellar minecarts, mysterious ghost trains—new mysteries are waiting to be unraveled!</p><p><strong>Wonderful Moments with Endless Immersion</strong></p><p>Miraland is also a fantastic place for you to relax and appreciate life.</p><p>With sunrises, sunsets, and the ever-changing weather, the creatures of Miraland have their own lives. Remember their daily routines and try to find them! Wear outfits with special abilities to fish by the river or catch bugs with a net. The game features an in-depth gathering system where the items Nikki collects become great clothing materials.</p><p>Stroll through flower fields and meadows, walk along mountain streams, and encounter merchants offering special outfits. Let your inspiration rise with the paper cranes on the streets. Use Momo’s Camera and dress Nikki up in your favorite outfits. You can choose the perfect backgrounds and frames to take pictures of her, capturing every heartwarming moment of your journey anytime, anywhere.</p><p><strong>It’s Glam Time Any Time!</strong></p><p>Thank you for being interested in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. We look forward to meeting you in Miraland!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer and interview with theme song singer Jessie J below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4dbzntYMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="インフィニティニキ グローバルリリース決定 記念PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyt8yKhZyC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《無限暖暖》全球公測定檔12月5日！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6DLW7obwIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Theme Song: “Together Till Infinity” Interview with Jessie J</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Infinity Nikki Theme Song Together Till Infinity | Exclusive Interview with Jessie J" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaWNdwimZHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="インフィニティニキテーマソング「Together Till Infinity」歌手Jessie Jスペシャルインタビュー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH3FANSECEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="《無限暖暖》主題曲《Together Till Infinity》－歌手Jessie J特別訪談公開！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7-8wTjBxz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We're coming up to a year since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-long-awaited-private-servers-arrive-next-week">launched its long-requested private servers</a>, and with that first anniversary looming, Rare has announced it's making some welcome changes, finally allowing players to earn full rewards while sailing in Safer Seas mode.
</p>
<p>
Safer Seas, if you're unfamiliar, provides a means for a single crew of up to four pirates to sail Sea of Thieves' entire open-world map without the ever-looming PvP threat of High Seas mode. While the absence of other crews means a good chunk of PvP focussed content is unavailable in Safer Seas, players <em>can</em> still tackle emergent PvE events, complete Trading Company voyages, and embark on narrative-driven Tall Tales.
</p>
<p>
Crucially too, it's possible to earn gold to spend on cosmetics and to increase Trading Company standing by earning reputation in Safer Seas - but both of these have been capped at 30 percent of the amount you'd ordinarily earn in High Seas until now, making things a bit of a drag for pirates who just want to, say, have a chill time raising funds for a shiny new figurehead away from the hubbub of Sea of Thieves' main mode.

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pzdHh1ALXc">new developer update</a>, however, Rare has acknowledged Safer Seas' "punishingly restrictive rewards", admitting they're working against its intention of providing an "onboarding ramp for new players". As such, it'll be increasing the current gold and reputation payout rate all the way up to 100 percent, matching the rewards earned in High Seas. There's a trade-off, though; the studio is dropping Safer Seas' level cap down from 40 to 25.
</p><p>
Essentially, that means players wanting to work their way up to Pirate Legend status and gain access to the various Trading Company cosmetics unlocked along the way will now need to hop over to High Seas much sooner. On the flip side, players looking for a safe environment to learn the ropes, or for a more relaxed space to amass gold or Seasonal Renown (which continues to be awarded at a 100 percent rate in Safer Seas) can now do so completely unhindered. It is, admittedly, a shame the Hunter's Call faction has been slapped with a lower level cap given how perfect Safer Seas mode is for a evening of quietly contemplative fishing (and given the Trading Company's already glacial reward payouts), but perhaps that'll be something - alongside the use of Captaincy ships, pretty please Rare - revisted as a Christmas treat <em>next</em> year.
</p>
<p>
In other Sea of Thieves news, players will soon get their hands on a number of features originally promised for the start of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-stealthy-season-14-grapple-guns-toward-an-october-release-date">current stealth-focused Season 14</a>, but which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-temporarily-yanks-nearly-all-its-big-new-stealth-features-following-significant-issues">pulled en masse</a> as part of "drastic steps" following a disastrous launch in October. Once Rare releases its next patch this Thursday, 14th November, players can finally lay traps, hang from ledges while sneaking, and wear disguises. Rare is also promising a number of "high impact" fixes, putting a stop to players using crouch to gain a firing speed advantage, and preventing pirates grabbing supplies from barrels after moving out of range. Additionally, measures have been introduced to stop players swiping treasure from the Fort of the Damned's vault by swimming underneath.
</p>
<p>
The studio notes this week's update has gained "additional [testing] time internally and with insiders", and that the team has also been trialling a new process enabling it to address critical experience issues as it locks down each build. "There's been a concerted effort across the team to improve on quality control", says Rare, and plans are also now in motion for "broader improvements for quality at the studio", with more details to come.
</p>
<p>
And finally, players sailing the Sea of Thieves within the first week of tomorrow's update will earn bonus gold and doubloons, alongside a Lucrative Voyage of Luck or Legendary Voyage of Luck for Pirate Legends. These bonuses will now be offered with every monthly update.

<p>When making a list of items to get people who love to game, many different thoughts come to mind. However, some may end up being a bit pricier, like a new PC or console. Assuming that every one this list is for already has something to play video games on, we are going to make this list dedicated more towards accessories and more.</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas gifts for gamers. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-gift-cards">Gift Cards</h3>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-gaming-headset">Gaming Headset</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Headsets are the perfect gamer Christmas gift. Luckily, there are quite a few on the market that work for both PC and console. Brands such as HyperX, Logitech and Turtle Beach all make extremely affordable headsets that come equipped with decent mics.</p>



<p>Not only do headsets look great as an accessory, but they can really make or break a gamer’s gaming experience. Having a good headset is essential for all gamers.</p>



<p>Headsets can be found online at Amazon, Best Buy and any other major retailer.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-controller-charger">Controller Charger</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is your favorite gaming enthusiast a controller gamer? Well, no one enjoys having to plug in their wireless controller or change the batteries frequently. That is why having a controller charger is a must for a gamer.</p>



<p>In fact, many of these chargers can work as a dock station, charging multiple controllers at once. This allows people to never worry about their battery running out.</p>



<p>Controller chargers are available on almost any major retailer’s website or in-store and make great cheap Christmas gaming gifts.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-gaming-chair">Gaming Chair</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Having a good gaming chair is essential. The truth is, many of those who game up close to a monitor have already begun to develop terrible posture and back issues. Having the right chair to prevent this could really help with any future health issues.</p>



<p>However, good gaming chairs can be quite expensive. While Amazon and Walmart do have some decent ones for cheap, if you are willing to spend a lot of money, then <a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/promotions?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=secretlab&amp;utm_campaign=us-s-brand-exact&amp;stop_redirect=true&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjISSPn-XXGekcKL3Za2Bhr-sR7kap-eGnI8V7m8FztnoYEfcHDvISxoCAgUQAvD_BwE">Secretlabs</a> would be a great purchase.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-mouse-pad">Mouse Pad</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We have already discussed controller accessories, but what about mouse and keyboard accessories? While having a full-desk mouse pad is great for gaming on a PC, it is also fun to have one with a unique design.</p>



<p>Whether it’s anime or other fantasy worlds, shops like <a href="https://higround.co/?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=645614658202&amp;tw_campaign=20950847950&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjPiGrbC5QxGYaDGGAZm4CDm-ZRYFwE-xc3PgODY-c5phDlKumWeBlxoCaWEQAvD_BwE">Higround</a> have some of the most unique and impressive mouse pad designs on the market. </p>



<p>Help deck your favorite gamer’s setup by getting him one of these top-of-the-market mouse pads.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-lighting">Lighting</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>RGB lighting is huge within the gaming world. Whether you are getting strips to put around your favorite gamer’s desk or buying Philips Hue lights to put behind their TV, lighting helps really immerse a gamer into the gaming experience.</p>



<p>Every major retailer sells lighting and you can even find special smart lights at stores like Home Depot and Lowes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-what-are-you-doing-signed-nathan-grayson-eight-years-old.1035297/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blizzard-warcraft-remaster-graphics-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today Blizzard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZ2jiW95qo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced remasters</a> of its classic fantasy real-time strategy hits <em>Warcraft I </em>and <em>II</em>, the games that put it on the map in the distant, functional past of the ‘90s. I should be celebrating; the second <em>Warcraft </em>was unequivocally my favorite game as a young child. I spent God only knows how many hundreds of hours playing it, and even He eventually got bored of watching me make my own horrible little maps and walked away. These remasters, though? They ain’t it.</p><p>I’ll preface this by saying that I’m very glad these classics remain playable. I’m sure Blizzard’s making a pretty penny off doing so, but at least it’s keeping its history alive. That said, I will be playing these re-releases with the new graphics turned off, because just look at them:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The art looks basic and generic where the original pixels inspired imagination, letting your mind fill in the gaps of these units’ physical features. Some, like Ogres and Ogre Magi, appeared almost photorealistic to young me, who sought to recreate them (over and over and over) in drawings and other, larger-scale art projects. In trying to more fully inhabit this universe whose collection of <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Guys</a> inspired me to dare to dream, I constructed life-sized (relative to an eight-year-old) paper dolls of nearly every unit in the game. It was my Everest, entirely because – again – the original game left room for interpretation.</p><p>Now admittedly, I’m no longer a small child fueled entirely by starry-eyed wonder, and that’s definitely part of the problem. But <em>Warcraft</em>’s original look was a product of its limitations, and trying to pave over that with plastic-y sheen is a mistake. I don’t know who the new graphics are for – I doubt these old games are going to lure in many new players, especially with art that looks like it belongs in a vastly less-intricate game than <em>Warcraft </em>– but it’s certainly not me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Impressive stuff! What’s not so impressive is a moment in the movie in which Hugh Grant’s character does a brief impersonation of Jar-Jar Binks. </p><p>On November 12, <em>IGN </em>posted a clip from Heretic showing Grant’s character talking about how, in the future, people will worship Jar-Jar Binks as a religious figure. The clip was later “borrowed” and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/discussingfilm/status/1856757930714173477?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/discussingfilm/status/1856757930714173477?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reposted by DiscussingFilm</a></span> on Twitter, where it blew up.</p><p>Jar-Jar first appeared in <em>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em> in 1999 and people hated him. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-star-wars-jedi-beq-jarjar-actor-ahmed-best-1850257681?_gl=1*1n90v1m*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUzMTQ0Ni4xMTIuMC4xNzMxNTMxNDQ4LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-star-wars-jedi-beq-jarjar-actor-ahmed-best-1850257681?_gl=1*1n90v1m*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUzMTQ0Ni4xMTIuMC4xNzMxNTMxNDQ4LjU4LjAuMA..">The negative reaction and abuse pushed Jar-Jar’s actor, Ahmed Best, to nearly kill himself</a></span>. But since then, he’s bounced back, has a great family, and has returned to <em>Star Wars</em> as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/themandalorian/status/1638937426357010432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/themandalorian/status/1638937426357010432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a badass Jedi who saved Grogu</a></span>. </p><p>Anyway, I have to imagine that Hugh Grant is aware of who Jar-Jar Binks is and at least looked up one video of the character talking. So I’m going to assume that the horrible impersonation is on purpose and is an example of how the character doesn’t know much about who Jar-Jar is, which might be a clue toward how much you can trust him. </p><p>Or maybe Grant did it, everyone on set was silent, he took that as a sign of success and moved on, and nobody had the heart to say it was bad. Either way, I’d pay money to see Grant impersonate more <em>Star Wars </em>characters. Give me your best Jabba or Yoda, my dude. </p><p><em>Heretic</em> is out now in theaters. Don’t boo the screen when his Jar-Jar impersonation happens. Okay? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-details-complete-update-list-and-how-its-handling-bots<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch has published patch notes for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 ahead of its launch on PC and consoles tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-8-patch-further-nerfs-recon-as-10v10-goes-live">a string of smaller updates</a> delivered throughout the last few weeks, today’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>patch notes</u></a> tease an update that is (unsurprisingly) the biggest yet. It’s got everything from weapon balance adjustments to details on Warzone, and while most of the news focuses on changes to Multiplayer and Zombies, the team made sure to iron out some Campaign wrinkles, too. There’s a laundry list of fixes for players of every shape and size, including those worried about players who want to cheat their way to the top.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/bo6-s1-sevhero-01-1731530923478.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone get Season 1 patch notes targeting cheaters and weapon balancing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One specific area Treyarch took aim at with its Black Ops 6 Season 1 update revolves around what it calls “disruptive behavior.” The team has adjusted ping thresholds to tackle VPN abuse and enhanced AFK detection in hopes of extinguishing boosting in lobbies. These are changes that should help ward off the use of popular exploits like bot lobbies, with additional tweaks to the anti-cheat measures sure to come as more updates arrive. Players will also be required to win 50 match-made Multiplayer matches before they’re allowed to dive into Ranked mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all about making every aspect of the Black Ops 6 experience authentic, so it’s not shocking to see a bevy of weapon tweaks coming to Multiplayer in Season 1, too. While assault rifles like the XM4, GPR 91, and AMES 85 received general damage buffs across the board, their headshot multipliers have also been reduced. Shotguns users were handed some changes, too, including increased damage multipliers and even more general damage improvements for the Marine SP and ASG-89.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Omnimovement comes to Warzone</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Season 1 alone comes with a long list of additions that will surely only change more as more content rolls out. Warzone, meanwhile, is an entirely different beast, but the team as Raven Software made sure to go over all of the details in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own post on the Call of Duty website</a>. While things like Area 99 and omnimovement are sure to give fans of the long-running battle royale mode an entirely new hill to climb, there are plenty of other smaller changes here to help iron out the mode, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those same Ricochet anti-cheat measures from Multiplayer will be carried into Warzone, for example. Warzone UI is also getting a massive facelift, which includes a legacy tab for previously unlocked Modern Warfare 2 and 3 customization options, an option to change your mini-map type, and a legacy content filtering system. Treyarch says it also brough back some original Warzone elements, such as equipment icons and armor plate shape.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More Multiplayer maps, modes, skins, and much, much more are coming with Season 1 when it arrives tomorrow.

As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reminder: We're using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible.

The Swat 5.56 has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively. We are also significantly reducing the power of the AEK-973 Rapid Fire, which was too strong not to take. </em></p><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We have been monitoring feedback on Sniper Rifles and are making some changes to promote more build diversity and improve the sniping experience before gaining access to a complete attachment set. We are lowering the baseline flinch on all Snipers and reducing the Flinch Resistance given by stock attachments. The resulting received flinch values are much lower up front and just a bit lower overall after equipping the stocks. We are also increasing Aim Walking Movement Speed bonuses on stock attachments to make those choices more valuable.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lastly, we are improving the ADS Idle Sway delay by default on all Snipers, meaning that on average there will be less deviation from your point of aim when entering ADS. Our goal is to support the various sniping playstyles you all enjoy through several viable weapon builds. We will continue to monitor weapon and attachment data as well as your feedback to ensure that all sniping playstyles are fun and rewarding in Black Ops 6. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Rifle Class Adjustments</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>All snipers now have 1 second of 50% Idle Sway scaling at the beginning of Aim Down Sight </li><li>All snipers have had base Flinch Resistance improved by 17% </li></ul><strong>Gunsmith  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Various updates to weapon descriptions. </li><li>Addressed an issue where stickers would appear in the Decal slot. </li></ul><strong>Perks</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li> Slight reduction to Ninja footstep volume.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Additionally we’ve made a slight reduction to default footstep volume.</li></ul></li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented Gearhead from being able to booby-trap enemy Care Packages.</li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented Equipment from replenishing with the Scavenger Perk.</li></ul><strong>Scorestreaks </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Archangel </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where the rocket would sometimes explode immediately when firing near a wall. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Challenges </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some Daily Challenges were not tracking properly. </li></ul><strong>Movement Updates </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed a bug causing player to be slowed when shot while mantling. </li></ul><strong>Theater </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Nuketown and Private Match recordings. </li><li>Addressed various stability issues when viewing matches. </li></ul><strong>UI </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to equip Operators they had not unlocked. </li><li>Addressed an issue where the AAR could close when entering the Scoreboard tab. </li><li>Addressed an issue earned and unearned medals would not display correctly in Collections. </li><li>Addressed an issue where the option to select an attachment skin would not be visible for some players. </li></ul><strong>Graphics </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some weapon effects would persist on the character after changing weapons. </li></ul><strong>Stability </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added numerous stability fixes. </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>ZOMBIES</strong></h3><strong>Maps </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Terminus </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step. </li><li>Addressed an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them. </li><li>Addressed an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision. </li><li>Addressed an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines. </li><li>Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Liberty Falls </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns. </li><li>Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Weapon Adjustments </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass.

Dive into Warzone with these powerful additions, now available alongside fan favorites from previous titles.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, Black Ops 6 weapons in Warzone will share similar values to their Multiplayer counterparts such as ADS speed, sprint to fire, and recoil. However, damage profiles for a number of weapons have been modified to establish a baseline for Warzone. We encourage new and returning players to study their favorite weapon’s details in the Gunsmith. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the integration of Black Ops 6, we also now have new tuning options for weapons that weren’t previously available, allowing us to adjust aspects like handling (ADS speed and sprint to fire), magazine sizes, recoil, and more. For instance, while the AS VAL has a default magazine size of 20 in Multiplayer, we’ve set it to 30 for Warzone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our goal is to make weapon adjustments faster to keep the available selection dynamic and engaging, without making any weapons feel obsolete. With these new tuning options, we aim to refine each weapon’s identity and role specific to their use in Warzone, such as emphasizing Assault Rifles as strong long-range options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, all bolt-action snipers and pump-action shotguns (while aiming down sights) from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Black Ops 6 will have a one-shot headshot potential within their respective max damage ranges. Additionally, in order to incentivize intentional aim, all shotguns will fire 5 pellets while ADSing versus 4 when fired from the hip. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We want players to feel that weapons from Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III continue to remain solid, viable choices in Warzone. Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin. We’ll continue to improve legacy weapons and attachments throughout the coming year to further support this vision. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Black Ops 6 Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 weapons have a unique Warzone damage profile, which includes specific base damage, range, and location-based modifiers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve adjusted several Black Ops 6 attachments to function differently in Warzone: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>CHF Barrel </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Assault Rifles, LMGs, DMRs, SMGs, and Pistols: This now grants an increased neck multiplier rather than a head multiplier. </li><li>For Sniper Rifles and Shotguns: This now provides increased leg modifiers instead of arm modifiers. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Flip Magazine </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The magazine capacity penalty from Multiplayer has been removed. In Warzone, flip mags match the base weapon's ammo capacity. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This attachment now applies a base damage penalty in Warzone, along with greater penalties to bullet velocity and range. </li></ul></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Modern Warfare II &amp; III Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A visual recoil reduction pass has been applied to Modern Warfare II weapons, enhancing their feel and control while shooting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrel and stock attachments from Modern Warfare II have also had their penalties reduced. Additionally, a significant balancing pass has been completed for underbarrel and muzzle attachments from both Modern Warfare II and III. All cons have been removed from these attachments, meaning they now only provide stat boosts, with each subcategory of underbarrels and muzzles functioning identically except for cosmetic differences. AMP attachments in these slots, however, retain their unique functionality and balancing. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Muzzle Enhancements </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Suppressors:</strong> Boost velocity and damage range. </li><li><strong>Comps:</strong> Improve recoil control. </li><li><strong>Flash Hiders:</strong> Increase damage range and firing aim stability. </li><li><strong>Breacher: </strong>Enhance melee damage and recoil control. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Underbarrel Enhancements </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Angled Grip:</strong> Increases hipfire and tacstance accuracy and aim walking steadiness. </li><li><strong>Handstop:</strong> Improves sprint-to-fire and ADS speed. </li><li><strong>Vert Grip:</strong> Enhances recoil control and firing aim stability. </li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Modern Warfare II and III weapons now have corner-slicing functionality, adding an extra tactical edge.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Global Weapon Builds</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Seamlessly access a custom weapon build you've created across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This time-saving feature lets you adjust any Build or Blueprint in one game, with changes automatically applied wherever that weapon is equipped. To create a build, select a base weapon or Blueprint, add attachments and cosmetics in the Gunsmith, and return to the Custom Loadout screen to save it. The build, with all selected customizations, will then appear in other modes under the same weapon type.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>New Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">These weapons are new to Season 01 and were not part of the original launch of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer in October 2024. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Krig C </strong><em>Assault Rifle </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>Full-auto assault rifle.

These summaries cover key objectives, mechanics, and rewards, making it easier for players to jump in and engage with contracts confidently.</p><strong>Bounty </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">When you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level "threat indicator." Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a "poached" outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract. </p><strong>Big Game Bounty </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract works similarly to the base Bounty but with a few twists. It only spawns after Circle 2 closes and prioritizes teams with the highest cumulative kills, provided they’re not already bounty targets. If you complete this contract by eliminating the target, you’ll earn an immediate advanced UAV ping along with extra cash and XP, offering greater rewards than a standard Bounty. </p><strong>Scavenger</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract. </p><strong>Intel</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">When you accept an Intel contract, a nearby upload station will be marked for your team to upload sensitive intel. Reaching the station and interacting with it initiates an "upload" phase where one team member must remain near the station until the upload is complete. If multiple players are in this radius, the upload speed can increase by up to 200%. Completing the upload rewards cash, XP, and a peek at the next circle’s location. Failure occurs if the timer expires or if your team is wiped. </p><strong>Most Wanted </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">By picking up the Most Wanted contract, you or the team member who picked it up becomes visible on the map for all players. Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a "VIP reward crate" appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash. </p><strong>Signals Intelligence</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract directs your team to hack nearby contracts for rewards. The nearest contract will be marked for hacking, although you can hack any contract. The number of contracts required depends on team size: solos and duos hack one, while trios and quads hack two. Hacking all required contracts completes the mission, rewarding your team with XP and ten periodic cash payments. Letting time run out or losing your team results in failure.</p><strong>Spy Drone</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract spawns multiple drones in a circle formation near your team. The number of drones varies with team size—solos face five, duos six, trios seven, and quads eight. Destroy all drones to complete the contract and earn cash, XP, a UAV, and redeploy drone beacon from the last drone. Failure results if time expires or your team is wiped out. </p><strong>Elite Contracts</strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">These are tougher versions of existing contracts, offering higher rewards. Elite Contracts reduce the contract time by 45% and reward an additional 1,500 cash on completion. Completing an Elite Contract also drops a reward crate with items, including an ammo pile, armor plate, ultra-rare weapon, and one of several rare items such as a UAV, redeploy drone beacon, deployable kiosk, or, with low probability, a Specialist or Foresight. Note that Most Wanted contracts cannot become Elite, although other contracts might turn Elite as the match progresses. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Contract Adjustments</strong></u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bounty </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Completing the contract now includes finishing downed targets you didn’t down yourself. </li><li>Bounty contracts should no longer start without a valid target. </li><li>"Poached" end state now counts as a contract failure for challenge tracking. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Most Wanted </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Removed the redeploy token from the Most Wanted reward crate in solos. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Scavenger </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The primary reward in Battle Royale and Resurgence is now an armor plate carrier. </li></ul></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PUBLIC EVENTS</strong></h2><strong>Battle Royale &amp; Resurgence </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Firesale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All items in the buy station are discounted at 50% for a limited time. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Restock  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All Supply Boxes close and are refilled with items. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Jailbreak  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All operators in gulag and eliminated operators are redeployed at the end of a timer. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Fly Buy  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A series of drones drop a number of deployable buy stations across the warzone. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Recon Flyover  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Avoid the detection of overhead drones to prevent your location from being broadcast. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Squad Loadout Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Loadout drops that are only accessible by their assigned team.</li></ul></li></ul><strong>Battle Royale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Contested Loadout Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Limited number of loadout drops that are accessible by any team. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Cash Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A number of crates are dropped across the field that, when captured, drop a bounty of cash. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Contractor  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All contracts pay out more when completed within a timer. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rogue Signal  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All teams compete on a random task -- the top teams get access to a reward with exclusive loot. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Resurgence </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bounty Royale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All teams are automatically assigned a Bounty contract. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>High Stakes </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A number of crates are dropped across the warzone that, when captured, double the XP earn in the current match for the team while also drop high tier loot.</li></ul></li></ul><strong>Plunder </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Blood Money </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>For the duration of the event, operators that are eliminated drop significantly more money.</li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Attack Choppers </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Once the match enters overtime, attack choppers enter the warzone.

Modiphius Entertainment has announced special box sets to help lower the bar to entry for the newest edition of its licensed Star Trek TTRPG, letting players live out their Starfleet fantasies.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Star Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> starter sets contain everything players need to begin their journey in the sci-fi universe created by Gene Roddenberry.</p>

These missions are designed to challenge a crew of 3-7 player characters. Those missions may involve sending aid to colonies in need, navigating complex issues on the borders of galactic powers, or exploring strange new worlds.</p>

<p>A single S<em>tar Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> starter set contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>A 48-page rules booklet providing an overview of Modiphius' 2d20 system.</li>
	<li>A 60-page campaign booklet containing the adventure "Infinite Combinations"</li>
	<li>A stat sheet for the Constitution-class U.S.S. Challenger and seven player character sheets. Each one has rules references on the back</li>
	<li>Four double-sided rules reference sheets.</li>
	<li>Five uniquely colored d20s.</li>
	<li>A series of tokens. 36 Momenum tokens, 36 Threat tokens, and 9 Determination tokens</li>
</ul><p><em>Star Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-adventures-second-edition-sets-course-for-strange-new-worlds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in February</a>. Alongside streamlined rules, the latest edition will include rules and resources for Klingon and Romulan player characters, expanding potential stories beyond Starfleet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of our key goals for second edition was to make the game accessible to new players, not just of <em>Star Trek Adventures</em> but of RPGs in general. I challenged the Starter Set campaign writers to think about what new gamemasters and new players might need to know as they play the game, and we wrote as much of that advice as possible into the campaign booklet. I hope you’ll be able to pick up the box, open it up, hand out characters, and then jump right into the first adventure and cooperatively tell a fun, evocative Star Trek story together. This one’s got it all–a dramatic rescue of citizens in peril, alien life-forms to investigate, and a science-fiction mystery to dig into and solve."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The starter sets are available for pre-order right now on Modiphius' store page. Pre-ordered sets are expected to ship in December. The sets will appear at retail stories in January.</p>

First, there is just a ton of white space in this game. Loading animations and default backgrounds all look like they’re made out of pearl. The result is like facing an oncoming car with nauseatingly bright LED high beams that never actually drives past. Second, because of all this light being output, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> absolutely destroys my phone’s battery life. A five-minute match ticks multiple percentage points off my meter. Before I know it, the whole thing is shutting down just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181?_gl=1*6cqpk0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUyMTM4Ni4xMTEuMS4xNzMxNTI2MjM5LjQxLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181?_gl=1*6cqpk0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTUyMTM4Ni4xMTEuMS4xNzMxNTI2MjM5LjQxLjAuMA..">my Charizard</a></span> has hit four energy. </p><p>  <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> needs a lot of things at the moment. Card trading for one, a feature that is missing but listed as coming soon. Also emotes, or any other way of communicating with opponents during matches. How else can I troll people when they make a mistake or their turn-one Misty immediately flips a tails? But more than any of those things, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>needs a dark mode. I let my premium pass free trial lapse today. If it came with a dark mode, I can promise you I would have re-upped. My family’s uninterrupted sleep and my corneas depend on it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
