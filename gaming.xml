            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming-as-dev-signs-new-partnership.1246311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>developer Dragami Games has announced it's signed an agreement with Taiwanese "IP investment and development" company Nada Holdings to develop new projects based on the aforementioned hack-and-slash property.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/nada-holdings-and-dragami-games-launch-new-ip-development-for-lollipop-chainsaw/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Nada Holdings website, the company says "multiple new projects" based on&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>&nbsp;will be launched as a collaboration between Nada and Dragami, although the company stops short of saying exactly what those projects will be.</p>

<p>Nada does, however, say that "cumulative sales" of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>have reached 1.5 million. That figure presumably includes both the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">last year's remaster</a>, since the company makes reference to "13 years of continued fan support".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=tjF6mMgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=uSgYR-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nada, the new collaboration between itself and Dragami aims to expand <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>through "multifaceted projects and cross-industry collaborations", so presumably, it's not just new games the two are working on.</p>

<p>Dragami CEO Shohei Sato says the new projects will "carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise", while Nada Holdings chairman Joe Teng says his company will "devote itself wholeheartedly to preserving the spirit of the original work and meeting the expectations of its fans".</p>

<p>Teng also says the collaboration will result in a "wide range of new projects", which, again, indicates that we're not just in for a&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>sequel. I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of anime series or streaming show in the works, as well as a spinoff or two.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game that was originally released way back in the mists of 2012 for seventh-gen machines. The original game was the result of a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>'s Suda51 and James Gunn, who's currently helming the latest&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>In 2022, a remake of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, but following requests from fans, the remake was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">scaled back to a remaster</a>, likely to stick to the developers' intentions of making the new version "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</i>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9ntpb0c2028v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;(as well as Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve’s Steam Deck has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">dominated the handheld gaming PC space</a> since its 2022 debut. But even as more powerful Windows handhelds arrived to keep up with more demanding games, none have beaten the Steam Deck’s combination of ease-of-use, ergonomics, power, and battery life at an affordable price.</p><p>That still hasn’t changed. The Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS is not the Steam Deck killer that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-review">some headlines</a> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">would</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lenovos-legion-go-s-with-steamos-is-the-only-real-alternative-to-a-steam-deck-2000621525">have</a> you believe.</p><div><p>This was supposed to be <em>a moment</em> for handhelds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">When the Legion Go S was revealed as the first authorized third-party handheld to run SteamOS</a>, with a $499 starting price, it looked like a true Steam Deck competitor was finally on the way. It even had the blessing and support of the Steam Deck’s creators — something we’d never seen before.</p></div><p>With an actual price of $599 and tradeoffs galore, the base Legion Go S with SteamOS is not a match for the $550 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>. The more powerful AMD Z1 Extreme model is not half bad, but it’s far more expensive at $829.</p><p>But within the disappointment, there is some good news: it’s better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the $730 Windows version with the same hardware</a> that came out last February, and SteamOS is definitely a better experience than Windows.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Z2 Go performance only on par with Steam Deck</li><li>Battery life falls behind Steam Deck</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->830</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Good performance</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Battery falls behind top Windows handhelds</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">I couldn’t believe just how poor the Windows gaming experience was</a> on this handheld’s AMD Z2 Go chip. A $550 Steam Deck ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> faster <em>on battery</em> than a $730 Lenovo did while plugged in at maximum boost! And as usual, Windows was a pig: the less you know about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=I%20spent%20nearly%2045%20minutes">the Windows out-of-box experience</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=it%20does%20not%20reliably%20go%20to%20sleep%20and%20wake%20up%20again">wake / sleep issues</a>, the better.</p></div><p>Thankfully, SteamOS washes away the Windows stains. Imagine <em>just pressing a power button</em> to pause a game, then seamlessly resuming the next time you press it! Imagine simply picking a language and scanning a Steam Guard QR code to log into your handheld for the first time, instead of spending 45 minutes batting away upsells for Microsoft 365 Copilot and kin.</p><p>And even though the Windows version has also (slightly) improved since I first tested it, the Legion Go S is<em> so much faster</em> with SteamOS: roughly 17 percent faster, in my tests.</p><div><h2>Windows vs. SteamOS with the Legion Go S</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (spring ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go SteamOS (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Windows improvement since spring</h3></th><th><h3>SteamOS improvement over Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>4.55%</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>69</td><td>0.00%</td><td>25.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>0.00%</td><td>21.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>64</td><td>76</td><td>3.23%</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>68</td><td>77</td><td>4.62%</td><td>13.24%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>39</td><td>50</td><td>8.33%</td><td>28.21%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>46</td><td>59</td><td>12.20%</td><td>28.26%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>50</td><td>63</td><td>11.11%</td><td>26.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>13.04%</td><td>26.92%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>14.29%</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>58</td><td>67</td><td>3.57%</td><td>15.52%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>6.35%</td><td>10.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>71</td><td>77</td><td>7.58%</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>72</td><td>78</td><td>7.46%</td><td>8.33%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>73</td><td>79</td><td>4.29%</td><td>8.22%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>21</td><td>4.17%</td><td>-16.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>15.38%</td><td>-20.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>26</td><td>6.90%</td><td>-16.13%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>33</td><td>27</td><td>10.00%</td><td>-18.18%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>35</td><td>27</td><td>9.38%</td><td>-22.86%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>48</td><td>54</td><td>-9.43%</td><td>12.50%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>56</td><td>59</td><td>5.66%</td><td>5.36%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>61</td><td>9.09%</td><td>1.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>62</td><td>-3.13%</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>71</td><td>0.00%</td><td>9.23%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>30</td><td>0.00%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>32</td><td>-4.76%</td><td>60.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>33</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>57.14%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>34</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>61.90%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>39</td><td>4.17%</td><td>56.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All values are average framerates at 720p and low settings, save Cyberpunk at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>SteamOS’s performance increase can translate to better battery life, too. On the Windows model, playing 2020’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla </em>at 720p resolution and 60fps at low settings required an average of 36 watts — enough to drain the Legion Go S’s 55 watt-hour battery in 1.5 hours. But with SteamOS, the same 60fps gameplay requires just 22 watts, giving you an entire extra hour of gameplay (55 watt-hours divided by 22 watts = 2.5 hours) <em>just by installing a different OS. </em></p><p>Not all games see as dramatic a boost, but the same is true of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>: if you play at 50fps, you get up to an extra hour of battery life from SteamOS.</p><p>SteamOS also makes it so much easier to change those power modes, map out new control schemes, and monitor your performance and battery life. You can simply hold down a button and flick a joystick to change your screen brightness or summon a virtual mouse, so there’s no need to dive into menus. You can even install <a href="https://decky.xyz/">Decky</a>, the unofficial SteamOS plugin loader, on a Legion Go S, to flesh out your Steam Library with game art or more easily install Epic Game Store titles.</p><p>But all that is also true of the Steam Deck, which costs less, excels at games that don’t require the horsepower of <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, and makes it easier to play decades of PC titles that <em>weren’t</em> built for gamepad controls.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck OLED next to the Legion Go S. Tap through my gallery for more hardware images.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The Steam Deck has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955238/valve-steam-controller-trackpad-deck-pc-gaming-controller-mouse-button">two large, responsive touchpads</a> that can emulate a trackball, pull up a radial menu, or each act as an extra set of four buttons to map your keyboard commands. The Legion Go S has a single ultra-tiny touchpad that puts up such a fight whenever I try to use it that I’ve already given up. The Steam Deck has four back buttons, enough so you can bind ABXY and never have to take your thumb off the right analog stick; the Legion Go S only has two.</p><p>More importantly to me: perhaps because of these differences in controls, the Legion Go S is missing the mountain of community controller layouts that Steam Deck, PlayStation, and Xbox controller users have been creating for years. Those layouts, which map the games’ commands to the controllers’ buttons and joysticks, make it a cinch to play mouse-and-keyboard games on a handheld without the tedious work of figuring out a control scheme from scratch. On a Steam Deck, or on any PC with a common controller plugged in, those layout options show up automatically if you go looking. With the Legion Go S, the repository of custom controller profiles is totally empty. The Legion Go S’s layout is nearly identical to Xbox, so why doesn’t it pull up Xbox controller profiles at least? This honestly feels like an oversight, and I hope it’ll be fixed.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Community Layouts section is just… empty.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As I explained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">my review of the Windows Legion Go S</a>, though, this hardware does feel great. It’s solid, reassuringly well-built, with my second-favorite screen on a handheld after the Steam Deck OLED. While it doesn’t have the true HDR or deep blacks of Valve’s OLED, the 8-inch IPS touchscreen makes the Steam Deck’s 7.4-inch screen seem cramped by comparison, to say nothing of the 7-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">ROG Ally X</a>. And like the Ally, Lenovo’s 120Hz variable refresh rate can make for smoother gameplay, particularly on the model with AMD’s Z1 Extreme chip.</p><p>The Steam Deck’s one notable disadvantage is that its performance has only slightly improved in three and a half years as games continue to get more demanding. Big hits like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> have pushed it out of its comfort zone, and where rivals like the Legion Go S can unlock better performance when plugged into the wall or draining their batteries at very high rates, the Steam Deck can’t.</p><p>The Legion Go S officially brings those “turbo” modes to SteamOS, as well. But if that’s why you’re buying, don’t get the $599 Z2 Go model.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z1 Extreme FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Deck OLED FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z2G battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Deck battery drain</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>50</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>22W (~2.5h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>73</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>79</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>82</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>44.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>61</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>22W (~2.2h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>74</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>77</td><td>99</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>100</td><td>N/A</td><td>41.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>30W (~1.8h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>62</td><td>57</td><td>23W (~2.4h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>31.5W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>61</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>23.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>32</td><td>47</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>50</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>34</td><td>52</td><td>N/A</td><td>43W (~1.3h)</td><td>44W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, 3 to 5-watt TDP, 60fps cap</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>8.1W (~6.8h)</td><td>8.2W (~6.7h)</td><td>6.9W (~7.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, lowest playable wattage and brightness, 30-40fps</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>7.6W (~7.2w)</td><td>8.0 (~6.9h)</td><td>5.2W (~9.4h)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not that the Z2 Go is slower than the Steam Deck overall. At max boost on wall power, the base Legion Go S can offer <em>up to</em> 35 percent better framerates. But the Z1 Extreme model offered up to 72 percent faster framerates than the Steam Deck and was 29 percent faster on average than the Z2 Go model. That’s enough to make a game feel smooth that was barely playable — like <em>Expedition 33</em> at the lowest settings — or comfortably go up an entire graphics preset in most games when you’re plugged into the wall.</p><p>(If you do plan to plug the Legion Go S into the wall, you may want to turn on fast charging in the BIOS — hold down Power + Volume Up when booting, then change Charging Speed Selection — and get yourself a 100W power adapter, because Lenovo’s stock 65W adapter isn’t enough to keep the battery from draining while you’re playing full bore.)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’ve been playing a lot of Expedition 33 on handhelds. Anecdotally, the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus runs it best and with the longest battery life; the Legion Go S Z1 Extreme is good for shorter sessions</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>The Steam Deck OLED can’t do turbo at all, but its custom chip can hold its own against the Z2 Go in unplugged “balanced” power modes. When I capped both at the same 15 watt power draw, the Steam Deck won in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em> and tied in <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, even as it lost in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon Zero Dawn, </em>and <em>Returnal</em>.</p><p>Another surprise in the Steam Deck’s favor: I played a <em>lot</em> of fiendish mansion-building mystery <em>Blue Prince </em>while testing the Legion Go S, and it’s far choppier on Lenovo’s handhelds. I don’t know if it’s had Steam Deck-specific optimizations, but I found I needed turbo mode on the Z1 Extreme for it to run as smoothly as it does on the Steam Deck.</p><p>If you do find yourself choosing between the two Lenovo Legion Go models, you won’t sacrifice much battery life by picking the beefier chip. In my tests, the Z1 Extreme model only drew 1 to 3 watts more than the Z2 Go on battery power — we’re talking about five minutes shorter battery life in the most intensive games and 15 minutes in less intensive ones.</p><p>But in those less intensive games like <em>Dirt Rally</em> or <em>Balatro</em>, the Steam Deck OLED is still the champ. Despite having a smaller 49Wh battery, it lasted over 50 minutes longer than either Legion Go S in my <em>Dirt Rally</em> battery drain test (where I set each handheld’s screen to the same brightness using a calibration tool) and managed two extra hours of magic poker game <em>Balatro </em>with battery-saving tweaks: 9 hours for Steam Deck vs. 7 hours for the Legion Go S.</p><p>I have to hand it to Lenovo and Valve: after tangling with the Windows model, I thought the entire Legion Go S lineup was going to be dead on arrival. But that’s not the case. Even the Z2 Go runs faster and more efficiently than it did on Windows, and the Z1 Extreme version is a legitimately good handheld if you get it with SteamOS. (You can technically install SteamOS on the Windows-based Legion Go S, but Valve tells me that’s not officially supported, and I ran into several issues when I tried it in early June.)</p><p>Valve and Lenovo have also moved swiftly to address some of the bugs the SteamOS version launched with. In the month and change since release, it’s fixed wonkiness around the power modes and the variable refresh rate screen, and how both the tiny touchpad and joystick LEDs can sometimes stop working when the handheld goes to sleep. (We’re still waiting on a way to control those RGB joystick LEDs in SteamOS, though.)</p><p>But while you might be happy with the $829 Z1 Extreme model around your home or otherwise close to an outlet, it’s not the best handheld you can buy. The Steam Deck OLED has it beat on price vs. performance and battery life for less intensive games, plus those community controller profiles and twin trackpads. It’s the pick if you don’t need beefy turbo modes or a big screen.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Legion Go S</em> <em>flanked by the MSI Claw 8 (top) and Asus ROG Ally X (bottom), both of which have far larger 80Wh batteries.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You might also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">try installing Bazzite on an Asus ROG Ally X</a>: I find it slightly less comfortable to hold, but with the same Z1 Extreme chip and a far larger 80Wh battery, it’s a better option than the Legion Go S for intensive games away from a plug.</p><p>Truthfully, though, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/editorial/688415/state-of-handheld-gaming-editorial-switch-2-deck-oled-sold-out">I wouldn’t buy <em>any</em> PC handheld</a> at this particular moment. Lenovo’s greatest achievement with the Legion Go S was to prove the superiority of SteamOS over Windows for handhelds, but prices are unusually high right now and Microsoft is about to fire back.</p><p>Even if you have no interest in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">an Xbox Ally or Xbox Ally X</a> this holiday season, it seems like Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">finally trying to fix handheld Windows</a>. I, for one, would want to know how the updated OS fares, and which devices will get it, before I buy a new handheld.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">the <em>New York Times</em> acquired <em>Wordle</em></a> and went all-in on games, there’s been something of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">a slow-brewing arms race in the space</a>. The <em>Times</em> continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips">release new games</a>, and it’s now up against intriguing competitors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687721/the-atlantic-games-hub-bracket-city"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a>, while established games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle"><em>Words With Friends</em></a> have adjusted their offerings in response. Also in that mix is Apple News Plus, which just launched a game that’s a bit like <em>Wordle</em> crossed with emoji.</p></div><p>It’s called simply <em>Emoji Game</em>, and each day you’re presented with three phrases, which have some letters filled in, but are mostly blank. There’s a partial hint as to what the word or phrase is that you’re trying to complete, and then a whole bunch of emoji at the bottom. The idea is to take the words or sounds the emoji represent and use them to fill in the blanks. So — and this is just an example I made up, so it’s not a spoiler — you might be presented with SH_ _ _, and an emoji of an elf. Stick it in there and you have a “shelf.”</p><p>It’s a novel twist on word games, which have become ubiquitous online over the last three years. It’s really forced me to use my brain in a different way, though I’m not sure if I enjoy it just yet. Maybe once it becomes a routine. That said, it’s nice that there doesn’t appear to be a fail state; when you guess wrong there’s no real punishment, though the game does count the number of moves it takes you to complete each puzzle, so there is a competitive element. The most recent few puzzles are also free to play, so you can get a feel for it even if you don’t currently have an Apple News Plus subscription. (It’s currently available only in the US and Canada.)</p><p>The <em>Emoji Game</em> is a small daily diversion, and one that points to the fascinating innovation and experimentation happening in the word game space. After <em>Wordle</em> and the subsequent rush of clones, there hasn’t really been a word game that has gone viral in the same way, and so designers are crafting interesting new twists on the formula to stand out. The idea is that you don’t necessarily need one blockbuster hit, but instead a varied collection that will keep folks coming back daily. Puzzmo, for instance, has steadily grown since it launched, with everything from an accessible crossword to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">a weather-based take on sudoku</a>. It just launched an experimental word game called <em>Missing Link</em> that’s like an elevated take on word search puzzles.</p><p>As subscriptions continue to become an established part of modern life — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss">no shade</a> — these sorts of daily games have proven to be a successful retention tactic. Habits are hard to break, and that’s especially true when they provide a brief, welcome respite in the form of clever word play. Or emoji.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708935/apple-news-plus-emoji-game-wordle]]></content:encoded>

                <p>“Come on now, if we all pull together, we can lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders.”</p><p dir="ltr">This is a line from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1N6aaKWiw&amp;pp=ygUZZnJhbmsgdHVybmVyIGdsb3Jpb3VzIHlvddIHCQnNCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the song "Glorious You"</a> by one of my favorite musical artists, Frank Turner, and it’s a lyric that constantly comes to mind as I play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.</a></p><p dir="ltr">For those who haven’t played either of the games, you are, regardless, likely already familiar with the series' core concept: You play as a porter who delivers packages between outposts in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Ahead of the first entry's launch in 2019, game director Hideo Kojima stated that Death Stranding was to kickstart a new “Strand” genre. “By incorporating the concept of connection(strand), it's [a] totally brand-new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system),” tweeted Kojima earlier that summer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">As I'm getting similar questions so I shall re-post. DS is not a stealth game. Could move subjectively but not a FPS shooting game either. By incorporating with the concept of connection(strand), it's totally brand new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system). <a href="https://t.co/1KaQUVH9zL" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/1KaQUVH9zL</a></p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2019</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">What that nonsense translates to in terms of gameplay is actually something quite unique. In order to help quickly and safely deliver all of your packages, you can fabricate a variety of tools and infrastructure: something as simple as a climbing anchor to swiftly rappel down the side of a cliff face, or something as extravagant as a long stretch of road between two outposts.</p><p dir="ltr">As you advance through the world and story, your constructs begin to seep into other players' experiences, aiding them as they progress through their own games. At the same time, the structures others build transform your world, too. You might approach a perilous edge and a climbing anchor is already there, having been placed by another player in their own game world. You could bring a slew of resources to a road-constructing terminal, only to find that you don’t need as many supplies as you thought you did because other players have already contributed a nice chunk of the required materials.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only does this save you a ton of time and help you get a leg up on your deliveries, but it incentivizes you into also paying into the system, knowing that when, for example, you place a zipline to rapidly descend down a mountain, that very same zipline will likely appear in another player’s game, ready for them to use.</p><p>The first game already expanded the tools and infrastructure on offer with the release of its Director’s Cut, which meant, of course, that Death Stranding 2 needed to develop those systems even further. However, this has resulted in numerous players feeling that the sequel is lacking a lot of the “friction” that made Death Stranding what it is. Some feel that, whereas the first game had a nice balance of systems in place to help you along the way, Death Stranding 2 literally paves over its cracks with too many apparatuses that overtly streamline the process of making deliveries.</p><p dir="ltr">I don’t disagree with this analysis. In Death Stranding, I absolutely was transporting--more often than not by foot--far fewer packages and materials, and had fewer options for helpful tools and infrastructure. In On The Beach, I’ve pretty much just driven around in my truck that not only can store a lot more stuff than my backpack can carry, but also protects said stuff from the environmental hazards and Timefall, the name for rain and snow in the game that rapidly degrades whatever it touches. And yes, that truck is battery powered, leading to <em>some </em>tension if I’m unable to locate a charging station while out and about. But fortunately, I’m usually never too far from a charging pole someone else has constructed.</p><p dir="ltr">The game tries to add some friction back into the experience with heightened dangers. You are more frequently asked to face off against enemies who now also have more tools and infrastructure of their own to confront you with, and the environment itself has become deadlier, with natural disasters like flooding and landslides. However, it still feels as if the additions to and changes from the first game greatly favor the player in the second.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the saying goes: more money, more problems. Just substitute chiral chrystals for dollar bills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732"></a><figcaption>The road more travelled.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the original Death Stranding, every task seemed monumental, especially as the game progressed and deliveries started to require you to transport a package within a limited time frame or without crossing over a certain damage threshold. The “strand” aspect of the game, in which you help other players and in turn they help you, became far less of a priority. When I placed a ladder down somewhere, it was because <em>I</em> needed a ladder there--and if that helped someone else out, great. I’d contribute to the creation of certain roads because I needed the last leg of my journey to go as smoothly as possible. If my actions helped complete a larger section of highway, fantastic, but that wasn't my objective.</p><p dir="ltr">In On The Beach, however, because I have so much potential to move more materials with greater ease, I’m finding myself compelled to complete the game’s highway and monorail systems for the sake of completing them. I’m finding myself more strategically deciding where to place a shelter in the wild that provides the most optimal point in the region to take a breather not only for myself and to mitigate any immediate "friction," but for every other player who might have that shelter pop into their game.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this was seemingly on the mind of the developers at Kojima Productions during production of the game, as Death Stranding 2 has an entirely new branch of side missions known as Aid Requests. While these include the familiar side cargo deliveries and pickup requests of the first game, they also include asks such as building a specific kind of infrastructure or placing a certain kind of tool in a particular location. The game doesn’t just want you to do deliveries; it wants you to fix the world. And in this there’s a new kind of friction to be found--one that takes the micro decision making of the first game and blows it up to a macro scale.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know you’ve been working, as hard as you can. To preempt the question, the expectation, and I understand.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738"></a><figcaption>Every little bit helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This overarching mission further incentivizes you to make additional deliveries, as doing so improves your standing with the various recipients, who will in turn allow you to take greater amounts of materials from their supplies. The game's new mining facilities and monorail tracks, which allow you to fabricate a large amount of materials and then deliver them via rail, also contribute this new goal, as they give you the ability to multitask and more quickly generate the means to help others.</p><p dir="ltr">But these stakes and transporting larger quantities of deliveries and materials come with inherent dangers too, as you are placing all your proverbial eggs in one basket. The terrain featured in the game feels even more dynamic than that of the first, requiring you to smartly navigate its, at points, treacherous paths. I have, on more than one occasion, been so reckless while trying to get somewhere quickly that my truck sustained enough bumps to severely damage my cargo, or in some cases, completely destroy it.</p><p dir="ltr">And when I <em>do</em> lose those materials, the sting is even greater, because now, I’ve not only let myself down, but myriad other players as well. It’s a feeling that resonates even harder thanks to the times we live in, where the institutions meant to help and protect us are either weaponized against us or being stripped for parts. It’s clear to me that the only path to a brighter future is one forged by individuals coming together to protect their loved ones and having empathy for complete strangers who are just trying to do the same. Death Stranding 2 brings that mission front and center, and when I fail it, I can’t help but be reminded of what happens if we fail in the same way in our own lives where, to me, failure is not an option.</p><p dir="ltr">“So don’t you worry. All things must end. There are sunlit uplands around the riverbend.”</p><p dir="ltr">While I agree that there might be less asked of the player in each individual delivery, I personally appreciate how the game has expanded on the foundation of the first Death Stranding. It pushes its various systems in appropriate directions that feel like a natural progression, placing additional emphasis and importance on its collaborative gameplay. I imagine that expansion felt like an expectation to the game’s development team, but I wonder if they expected that direction to stir up such feelings. Given Kojima’s track record of prescience regarding societal progression and understanding of the human condition, striking that chord of emotion was likely also a natural side effect of this destined gameplay evolution. In the narrative, even more responsibility to save the world is placed on the shoulders of its protagonist, which is then mirrored in the literal placement of even more objects on Sam’s back. But Death Stranding 2 makes it clear that if we all pull together, that weight can be lifted.</p>

It's not magic brain science to suggest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is going to be big, but one investment firm has suggested it's going to be big to the tune of $7.6bn in just two months, while also securing the accolade of "largest gaming release of all time." 
</p>
<p>
That's according to Josh Chapman, managing partner at "thesis driven investment firm" Konvoy Ventures (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/">GameSpot</a>). Chapman shared his predictions <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/">over on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting GTA 6 will be the "largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Chapman believes Grand Theft Auto 6 will generate $7.6bn USD in revenue in the first 60 days of its launch, and that it'll recoup its development costs in under a month. It's worth noting, however, all this is based on certain unconfirmed assumptions. Chapman's maths assumes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">base version of GTA 6 will cost $80</a> (neither Rockstar nor publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> have announced a price yet, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">certainly</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">precedent</a>), and his predictions are also based on a speculative development budget of $2bn - a figure that's long been rumoured, but never actually confirmed.

<p>
Things then veer away from the financial to the perhaps a little fanciful, with Chapman calling GTA 6 the 'next user-generated platform'. More specifically, he predicts it'll "have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>] and Roblox)", alongside "200-person lobbies [with] higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily."
</p>
<p>
None of that's particularly far-fetched, of course, but neither is it supported by any real evidence, but given Chapman notes, "In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released", there's maybe a bit of room for some enthusiastic wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May next year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay in May</a>. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as Take-Two confirmed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.

			<p>An Assassin's Creed live-action TV series has been officially greenlit by Netflix, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4tiTYS8oDJ3ygEoJHIyrdQ/netflix-greenlights-assassins-creed-liveaction-series">confirmed</a> today.</p>



<p>The show, which will follow characters across pivotal historical events as they get involved in the sceret war between two faction, one determined to shape humanity's future through control, the other fighting to preserve free will, essentially running with the same premise of the video game series focused on the long way between the Assassins and the Templars, is the first series to be developed under the agreement signed back in 2020 between Ubisoft and Netflix to produce content based on the popular series. Emmy nominees Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing) are set as creators, showrunners, and executive producers of the newly announced show.</p>



<p><em>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us,"</em> said David Wiener and Rober Patino in a statement. <em>"Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</em></p>



<p>The latest entry in the Ubisoft series is Assassin's Creed Shadows.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-reportedly-trying-%E2%80%9Chail-mary%E2%80%9D-tactics-to-make-its-lawsuit-against-palworld-makers-stick.1246233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">confirmed it would be suing Pocketpair</a>, the studio behind last year's massive hit Palworld, many saw this as an inevitable outcome considering how litigious Nintendo is on a good day.</p>



<p>While the suit is still ongoing, and Pocketpair has already been forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">make changes to Palworld</a> based on the patents Nintendo is claiming Pocketpair is infringing on, a new report from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/">Gamefrays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nintendo-is-taking-desperate-measures-in-patent-infringement-case-against-palworld-and-its-looking-a-little-weird">Windows Central</a>) seems to show that Nintendo is doing everything and anything to make its suit against Pocketpair stick, even going so far as to change the patents it claims Pocketpair is infringing on, mid-suit. </p>



<p>Gamefrays does stipulate that changing a patent in the middle of an infringement suit isn't entirely unheard of, though it's usually done when the patent owner is concerned that its original patent will be found to have been invalid in the first place. It also doesn't necessarily mean that Nintendo is on the back foot or that it'll lose the case. Though, Gamefrays does point out that Nintendo's new language for the patent is awkward at best, which makes the change all the more weird.</p>



<p>Gamefrays calls out Nintendo's use of the phrases "<em>even when</em>" and "<em>even if</em>," neither of which is common when writing patents, nor are they clear to define in patent law. According to its report, Gamefrays calls the use of the word "<em>even</em>" and Nintendo's changes to the patents a "<em>Hail Mary</em>" move to try and secure a win for its suit in Japan. </p>



<p>Another unfortunate update on the lawsuit for Nintendo, is that it doesn't seem like it'll be able to bring a suit against Pocketpair in the US. The changes Pocketpair has already made, and the evidence Pocketpair is presenting around games with similar mechanics to Palworld that Nintendo has not gone after, all seem to be the immovable objects blocking Nintendo's path to suing Pocketpair in the US. Not that it won't keep trying, of course. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-finally-moving-ahead.1246227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is finally moving forward at Netflix, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the series, which will be helmed by showrunners and co-creators Roberto Patino and David Wiener, has been given the green light, although there's no word of a release date or even a release window yet.</p>

<p>Patino says the goal with the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is to create "something undeniable for fans all over the planet", promising to highlight the franchise's focus on "people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith" underneath the "scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=BwAgjaLi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=So66-Csq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't yet know who the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>live-action series will focus on, but my money's on Ezio.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix scripted series VP Peter Friedlander, meanwhile, says the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is an "epic adventure" that will honor the franchise's legacy while also inviting "longtime fans and newcomers alike to experience the thrill of the Brotherhood as never before".</p>

<p>It isn't yet clear which of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s many time periods the show will focus on. According to its official logline, the show "follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny", so it's very possible we'll be seeing multiple historical periods, which would be interesting.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series focuses on just one period, though, my money's on Renaissance-era Italy and the story of Ezio, since he's probably the franchise's most popular protagonist.</p>

<p>Of course, given that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count" rel="nofollow">set a new Steam record for the franchise</a>&nbsp;and that sales for the modern action-RPG titles are strong across the board, we could well see&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow"><em>Origins</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a></em>,&nbsp;adapted instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=g5ER1Gok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=Fv7O9PNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla&nbsp;</em>serve as the basis for the upcoming live-action series?</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix series was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-in-development" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>, so presumably, it's essentially been stuck in something akin to development hell since then, although the series has obviously clawed its way out of that blighted land now.</p>

<p>It will find a landscape newly receptive towards streaming adaptations of gaming properties, with shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow">various other properties</a>&nbsp;making their way to streaming services in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether the series turns out better than the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassins-creed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">somewhat ambivalently-received</a> movie remains to be seen, and since we don't know when the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix show will air, it might be a while before we find out.

Except the most important 30 milliseconds.” He goes on to say that remake developer Vicarious Visions “completely botched how jumping works.” That’s fighting words where I come from (Hillcrest, represent). But he’s got some numbers to back him up. Here’s his explanation of the difference between how jumping works in <em>Crash </em>1996 and the recent remakes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons–pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input [...] So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we’d subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input.</p></blockquote><p>He sums this up by saying “Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. [The game] intercepted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.”</p><p>This is the difference. But I’m kinda skeptical this morning, the 17th of July in the year of our lady 2025. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Andy Gavin for more details.</p><p>After some quick testing, I’m either missing some delicate nuance that I’d go so far as to say is negligible, or, Andy, I have to wonder if we’re playing the same remake? Check your LinkedIn messages, I’m curious about the specific differences in actual gameplay instances. </p><p>Granted, I tested things out on a PC with a Bluetooth Xbox controller using a backup of the original game’s image running in RetroArch with a Beetle PSX core. I then timed my jumps in each game to a metronome and jumped every “whole note” (I’m a musician, that’s how you’re going to get accurate timing from me). Some of you are probably freaking out: This is a horribly inaccurate way to drill down into the specifics of a 30-60 millisecond. Until I can devise a <em>Mythbusters</em>-grade testing unit complete with a robot that times a button press at an exact specified time (and then something that blows it all up), I can’t say for certain, but the jumps feel more similar than Gavin’s assertion that the remake only contains “maximum height” jumps. I mean, here’s another gif showing smaller jumps in motion on both games: </p><figure id="" data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Left: Remake.

But also, as my colleague and <em>Kotaku</em> senior reporter Ethan Gach mentioned in our work Slack, <em>Mario</em> had different jump heights based on how long you held the button, so how unique is the <em>Crash </em>jump anyway? I also recently replayed these remakes. I and many other long-time <em>Crash</em> fans typically admit, this collection feels very accurate to the original 1990s-era experience.</p><p>I’ll get back to you if and when I learn more about <em>Crash</em>’s attempts to defy gravity.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482]]></content:encoded>

A crowdfunding campaign goes live next week, but a hands-on demo in the meantime shows just how bonkers this Android device is. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A first-look at the OneXSugar Sugar 1 was shared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/708283/toying-with-the-onexsugar-sugar-1-transforming-gaming-handheld&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/708283/toying-with-the-onexsugar-sugar-1-transforming-gaming-handheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with Sean Hollister at <em>The Verge</em></a></span>, who flipped it around at his garage work station like he was solving a portable gaming Rubik’s cube. There are two controller side panels, similar to a Nintendo Switch, but there’s also a second screen, similar to a Nintendo DS, and you can reconfigure them to achieve your preferred ergonomic layout and overload your multi-tasking gamer brain. Finally, you can scroll TikTok AND play games at the same time. </p><p>The Sugar 1 sports a 6.01-inch screen and a smaller 3.92-inch display and uses a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor for Android, cloud, and “retro gaming” (read: emulation). In addition to multitasking, the device is clearly aiming at players nostalgic for the days of the DS and 3DS, whose second-screen mechanics should be easily replicated given the form factor. It’ll be a pricey way to revisit, say, <em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em>, however. The Sugar 1 crowdfunding campaign goes live July 21, and Hollister suggests the device will cost north of $600. </p><p>That pushes the transforming handheld into PC gaming handheld territory. For instance, Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox Rog Ally device <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lzdtp2/rog_xbox_ally_prices_have_been_leaked_by_mistake/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lzdtp2/rog_xbox_ally_prices_have_been_leaked_by_mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is rumored</a></span> to start at $600, with the beefier Rog Ally X model coming in at closer to $1,000.

That one is just a screen with handles, though. No fancy hinges, sliders, or second screen. </p><p>The Sugar 1 might not end up being anywhere near the most practical gaming device when it finally comes to market, but it’ll no doubt be the most fun to fidget with. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/onexsugar-android-switch-ds-handheld-snapdragon-gen-3-1851786481]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, July 17, 2025. Below, we examine the ways the Paper Mario series has changed over the years, and how Origami King tried to recapture its early magic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Though Mario's platforming adventures are universally adored, the Paper Mario series has a much more mixed reputation. Its first two installments, Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64 and its GameCube sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, are widely regarded as Mario's finest role-playing outings, enchanting players with their imaginative storybook worlds and irreverent humor. As the series progressed, however, it gradually deviated from its RPG roots, shedding many of the elements that had made the first two games so beloved. While the series has never quite been the same since, its Switch installment, Paper Mario: The Origami King, is the only one that has come close to matching the heights of the original titles.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's identity crisis can be traced all the way back to 2007's Super Paper Mario. Originally announced for the Nintendo GameCube, this particular entry effectively began life as an offshoot of an offshoot--one last hurrah for the aging purple console spun out of repurposed assets and ideas from The Thousand-Year Door. By that point, however, GameCube sales had flatlined and a new generation was on the horizon, prompting Nintendo to move the title to the Wii, where it became many new players' introduction to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">As its moniker suggested, Super Paper Mario took a considerably different approach than its predecessors. Whereas previous games were turn-based RPGs with some platforming elements sprinkled in, Super Paper Mario inverted this formula; this entry was predominantly a platformer with some light RPG elements. Mario and company could still gain experience points for defeating enemies, which in turn increased their health, strength, and other attributes. But environments were largely laid out as side-scrolling stages, and the strategic, turn-based battle system of old Paper Mario games was gone; instead, players defeated foes by stomping on them in real time, a la the classic Super Mario Bros. games.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a stark departure from previous titles, though ultimately still an enjoyable one. Taken on its own, Super Paper Mario was a charming romp that retained the series' signature humor while contorting its gameplay in interesting ways. But it also signaled a shift in direction for the franchise, one that downplayed its role-playing qualities in favor of simpler stories and more immediate gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">This was borne out in the next installment, Paper Mario: Sticker Star for the 3DS. Although the game brought back turn-based combat, it removed party members entirely; this time, Mario faced off against foes solo, which completely changed the dynamic of battles. Moreover, many of the series' hallmark RPG elements were either streamlined or excised. Coins effectively doubled as currency and experience, while badges and Flower Points were replaced with stickers that were consumed upon use. It was a novel attempt at deconstructing RPG mechanics, but it further strayed from the elements that endeared the series to so many in the first place, and it would be largely dismissed by fans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665"></a><figcaption>Yes you are, little fella.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Part of this displeasure also owes to the game's unconventional structure. In an effort to tailor the adventure for a handheld system, Sticker Star divided up the interconnected world of previous Paper Mario games into a series of compact "levels," which were laid out across a world map like a traditional Mario platformer. These were generally roomier and more puzzle-oriented than the platforming stages of Super Paper Mario, but they made the world feel less convincing. Early Paper Mario games were so memorable because they whisked players through whimsical locales populated by unusual characters, which imbued each area with a distinct sense of place--something that Sticker Star's disjointed levels could never achieve.</p><p dir="ltr">Sticker Star's eventual followup, Paper Mario: Color Splash for the Wii U, refined some of its more divisive elements, making for an overall stronger game that was better received by fans. But it also retained a few of its predecessor's controversial qualities, namely its level-based structure and resource-centric battle system. The game was ultimately a step in the right direction, but it was nonetheless a vastly different experience from the series' earliest titles, which reinforced the perception that Paper Mario had changed permanently.</p><p dir="ltr">It's for these reasons that many fans greeted the announcement of Paper Mario: The Origami King with a mix of excitement and trepidation. As promising as the game initially appeared to be, the question of whether it would return to the series' roots or continue the divisive experiments of more recent Paper Mario games loomed over every marketing beat. The end result ultimately falls somewhere in the middle. While The Origami King still follows the action-adventure direction of its immediate predecessors, it also channels the spirit of earlier games with its vast setting and quirky cast, making it the series' best installment in over a decade--and a promising sign for Paper Mario's future.</p><p dir="ltr">This shift is immediately obvious in the game world. The Origami King eschews the level-based structure of Sticker Star and Color Splash for a large, interconnected setting--one that's much closer in scale and imagination to the first two Paper Mario games. Amid his travels, Mario visits a range of stunning and memorable environments, from the brilliant, red-and-orange papercraft foliage of Autumn Mountain to the opulent Shroom City--a gaudy oasis shining in the middle of a sprawling desert. Each area of the world is richly detailed and home to some hilarious denizens, which makes them feel much more like proper locales than the discrete stages of Sticker Star and Color Splash.</p><p dir="ltr">Crucially, Mario is also no longer traveling alone. The Origami King pairs the plumber up with a rotating cast of partner characters. While none of these companions quite match up to the beloved party members of the series' earliest titles (and are much more limited in battle), they add color to the world and a heartfelt touch to the story. The adorable Origami sprite Olivia is one of the series' more charming companions, playing a pivotal role in both combat and in moving the plot forward. Mario is also joined by several other characters at different points in the adventure, including an excitable Toad archeologist and even longtime nemesis Bowser, who spends much of the game helplessly folded up like a greeting card.</p><p dir="ltr">But most notable is Bobby, an amnesic Bob-omb who joins you during the game's second major chapter. Despite his nondescript appearance (unlike Bombette and Captain Bobbery from earlier titles, Bobby is just a standard-issue Bob-omb minion, albeit one curiously missing his fuse), Bobby quickly becomes one of the most memorable companions in the entire series thanks to his poignant character arc, which culminates in a genuinely shocking and moving scene. It's unexpected territory for a game about paper characters and office stationery to explore, which makes it all the more impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system, too, has once again been reimagined, and for the better. Moving away from the resource management of its two predecessors, The Origami King introduces a new panel-sliding system, which challenges players to rotate sections of the battle arena against a time limit and line up enemies for optimal damage. This makes every encounter feel like a rapid-fire micro-puzzle, and outside of the original turn-based battle system undergirding the first two Paper Mario games, it's the most thrilling battle system the series has yet devised.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain aspects of The Origami King still fall short of the series' best, but it's thanks to these elements that the game comes closer to recapturing Paper Mario's early magic than other recent installments. It remains to be seen if the series' next eventual title will follow in Origami King's footsteps or take inspiration from The Thousand-Year Door, which was also released on the Switch, in a lavishly remade form, in 2024. Whatever the future may hold, Paper Mario is in better shape than it's been in many years.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before Tony Hawk's Pro Skater shredded on to the video game scene in 1999, the man himself "had given up" on making a skateboarding game. Hawk revealed in a new interview that talks with various developers and console manufacturers about the concept were going nowhere in the mid- to late 1990s.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/07/17/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-remake-olympics/85205239007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, Hawk talked about how "it was kind of an uphill battle convincing anyone" to create a skateboarding game. He cited growing up on the medium as a reason for pursuing the idea, noting the Intellivision was the first console he owned. Later, Hawk had a Commodore 64, SNES, and then a PlayStation, and he also briefly did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTcDO0Ab2A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video-editing work for the TurboGrafx 16</a> in the early '90s. But with multiple companies passing on his idea, Hawk noted in 1997 that he basically had thrown in the towel.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Activision, however, was working on a skateboarding game and reportedly heard about Hawk's desire to make such a title. "And so I went to Activision," said Hawk. "I saw a very early build of what became THPS (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater), and immediately, I knew this was the game. I could tell instinctively that this would be the most fun, that this would be the best one to be involved with, and with my connections and resources and experience, we could make this something truly authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">The pairing ultimately led to one of the most beloved video game franchises of all time--one that just saw the remake launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. The series has spanned over two decades and a dozen games, with Hawk admitting that THPS games are what fans want to talk about when he meets them in public.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Hawk, he usually plays as himself in the games, though he does test out other skaters to check out their tricks. If he had to choose someone other than himself, "then I'm playing my son Riley," Hawk said.</p><p>Hawk is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-is-auctioning-his-gear-and-board-he-used-when-he-did-an-iconic-trick/1100-6532828/">auctioning off his skateboard that he rode for the first-ever officially recorded 900</a> performed, which happened in 1999--the same year the THPS franchise began. You can also see how Hawk has changed over the years in video game form with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-comparing-all-original-skaters-to-their-2000s-versions/2900-6761/#1">comparison of the skaters in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> from the original games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">which was first announced in 2020</a> - is finally moving forward.</p>
<p>The long-in-the-works adaptation based on Ubisoft's games is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show.</p>

<p>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007," Wiener and Patino told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a>. "Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith."</p>
<p>Continuing, the duo said Assassin's Creed is "about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance", but above all that "this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time" and "what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break".</p>
<p>Said Wiener and Patino: "We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny". That all sounds suitably Assassin's Creed-y.</p>
<p>In addition to Wiener and Patino, Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill of Ubisoft Film and Television will serve as executive producers for the Assassin's Creed series along with Matt O'Toole.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to work alongside Roberto, David, and our Netflix partners to bring this beloved franchise to series," said Boykin. "We look forward to delivering an experience that speaks to the heart of what fans love about Assassin's Creed, while introducing its unforgettable worlds and timeless themes to new audiences worldwide."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series.

<p>"An all-new design that eliminates the risk of detachment entirely"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Dbrand Reveals &quot;Joy-Lock&quot; System To Deal With Killswitch Joy-Con &quot;Controversy&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585166eb74a62/dbrand-reveals-joy-lock-system-to-deal-with-killswitch-joy-con-controversy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/dbrand">Dbrand</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>A short time ago, Dbrand came under fire for design issues with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-teething-troubles-aside-this-case-is-killer">Killswitch Case for Switch 2</a> – in short, some users were finding that, with the case attached, the magnetic connection between the console and its Joy-Con 2 controllers was weakened, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">leading to them disengaging unintentionally</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Dbrand appeared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ljlvr9/nobody_holds_their_switch_2_like_this_dbrand/">dismiss the issue</a>, only to quickly apologise and promise to issue replacement parts that would solve the problem. It has now contacted its customers to clarify how it is dealing with the fault.</p>
<p>"A few weeks back, you may have seen articles floating around about a Killswitch controversy," says the company in an email seen by Nintendo Life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The extreme tl;dr version of this issue is that, when the Killswitch is held under very specific one-handed conditions, some Switch 2 Joy-Cons are unexpectedly detaching from the main console. This is due to a manufacturing tolerance issue on our original production run. Because the tolerance issue only affected a portion of stock, there’s a good chance you never noticed the issue at all. Whether you’ve experienced the issue or not, there’s no reliable way for us to determine which units were affected. As a result, we’re taking a cautious approach and simply replacing everyone’s Joy-Con Grips for free."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same email, the manufacturer insists it has gone one better by creating an "all-new design that eliminates the risk of detachment entirely" called 'Joy-Lock'.</p>
<p>Dbrand is also taking steps to address complaints levelled at its Dock Adapter, which ships alongside the Killswitch Case for Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In addition to feedback about the Joy-Con Grips, we’ve heard from customers that our Dock Adapter makes it difficult to un-dock the Switch 2 with one hand. As a result, users find themselves needing to hold the dock adapter down with one hand, while un-docking their Switch 2 with the other. To remedy this, all shipments of Joy-Lock Grips will also include a set of friction pads to apply to your Dock Adapter. These friction pads will make the Dock Adapter seat more snugly on the OEM dock, enabling one-handed undocking."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dbrand says it is "currently in the process of mass-producing about half a million sets of the new Joy-Lock Grips and a similar number of Dock Adapter friction pads," and that shipping is expected to take place in early August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Virtuos, the co-development team that is working with Konami to deliver Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the studio that just helped Bethesda develop The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">confirmed</a> what was previously rumored, that the studio has suffered mass layoffs, with nearly 280 staff impacted, or 7% of the company.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-metal-gear-solid-delta-virtuos-mass-layoffs-rumor/">Yesterday</a>, French journalist Gauthier Andres was the first to report the layoffs, along with claims from sources they spoke to about internal troubles at Virtous. Today, Virtuos confirmed the cuts, which, according to Virtuos, are slightly under the 300 number that Andres first reported. Virtuos did not comment on any alleged internal issues, and in its statement claimed that its "<em>immediate focus is on managing this transition with care, transparency, and respect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry</em>," its statement began. "<em>As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This evolution involves a rebalancing of roles across our studios and geographies. Approximately 7% of Virtuos' global workforce was affected, primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts in the industry. This includes about 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe, including</em> <em>fewer than 10 in France, where the core team working on Oblivion Remastered is located</em>."</p>



<p>The statement goes on to explain why so many of the roles impacted are in its studios based in Asia, claiming the studio "<em>need[s] to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development.</em>"</p>



<p>As far as the other projects Virtuos has on the go, the studio says it "<em>remains fully committed to all our partnerships, including ongoing work on announced titles such as Oblivion Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>." </p>



<p> A key element of Andres' report from yesterday was how the studio's leadership is pushing to over-deliver in quality compared to the budget the studio is given. The Oblivion Remastered team was allegedly pushed to work harder despite Virtuos receiving no royalties on the game's sales, so that the studio could have Oblivion Remastered as a showpiece for the kind of work they are capable of.</p>



<p>That's the kind of strategy that can potentially lead to more contracts, but the only sure result a strategy like that can have is burning out the talent you're trying to show the studio has. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> didn’t make the best first impression, though I’m not talking about the game itself. The concept of a gritty reboot of <em>Pac-Man</em> first reared its strange head in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24313309/secret-level-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, an anthology that turned notable video games into animated shorts that mostly felt like extended commercials. And that’s exactly what the episode “Circle,” which reimagined <em>Pac-Man</em> as a blood-soaked survival story, turned out to be. But as off-putting as the episode was, it turns out that the premise actually works for a <em>Metroid</em>-style action game.</p><p>For those who didn’t watch <em>Secret Level</em>, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> puts you in the role of an unnamed, hooded swordmaster, who awakens to find himself inside some sort of dark alien labyrinth. He’s greeted by a floating drone named Puck, who serves as both a guide and a partner to survive in this treacherous world. Puck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICElL6dBsrQ">of course</a>, is Pac-Man.</p><p>For the most part, the game plays a lot like a typical Metroidvania. It’s a side-scrolling game that’s heavy on action, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, and as you defeat bosses and collect gold, you’ll slowly expand your arsenal of skills, which opens up the game further. The twisting, maze-like map is full of dead ends that you can’t explore until you get the right ability, which include staples like a double jump and grappling hook. You can also craft various upgrades, both permanent and temporary, so you can customize the character to your liking. It’s a satisfying loop of exploration, combat, and problem-solving (usually involving some kind of platforming sequence), punctuated by tense, elaborate boss fights that depend a lot on pattern memorization.</p><p>I could be describing a lot of other games here, but there are a few elements that make <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> unique. And it mostly has to do with Puck. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are rails that Puck can ride on, sort of like Pac-Man moving his way through a classic arcade maze. It’s reminiscent of Samus’ morph ball ability, except it’s relegated to predetermined areas of the map. Later on, there are actual <em>Pac-Man</em> mazes to play through, too, complete with pellets and ghosts to eat.</p><p>The game is at its best when you’re quickly swapping between Puck and the swordmaster, either to navigate a tricky platforming sequence or defeat enemies. In one early boss battle, I was able to use a rail on the ceiling to avoid projectiles, and then drop behind the enemy for some quick sneak attacks. Early on, Puck and the swordmaster gain the ability to temporarily fuse together to create a power-up that’s sort of like a mech suit, which you can use to devastate most enemies and even avoid environmental hazards. Oh, and when you’re a mech, you can eat your enemies to gain materials needed for those important unlocks.</p><p>One of the nice things about <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is that, unlike the animated short that preceded it, it doesn’t overdo it with the grim tone. It can get a little bloody when you’re slicing through creatures, but it’s not gratuitous. In fact, much like <em>Dread</em>, the oppressive tone creates an interesting kind of tension, one that makes the rare moments of respite feel especially welcome. That said, the cutscenes are self-serious and convoluted, and there are silly moments where Puck becomes giant and eats the corpses of bosses, but these are mostly easy to ignore if all you want to do is explore a complex map, <em>Metroid</em>-style.</p><p>That’s really what the game offers. The combat is solid, the platforming is challenging, and the bosses are exciting. And thankfully, the tone mostly doesn’t intrude on the experience, while the <em>Pac-Man</em> theme brings <em>just enough</em> new to add an interesting twist for those well-versed in Metroidvanias. <em>Secret Level</em> may have been a commercial, but it was a pretty poor one: it missed what actually makes <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> worth playing.</p><p><sub>Shadow Labyrinth <em>launches on July 18th on the PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/708833/shadow-labyrinth-review-gritty-pac-man]]></content:encoded>
