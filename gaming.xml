			<p>Known leaker 'Midori' has backed a years-long rumor about the existence of a The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Switch port.</p>
<p>For several years, several sources have been claiming that Nintendo is sitting on Switch ports of both The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. Both titles were expected to be announced as part of the 35th anniversary of the Zelda series back in 2021, but unfortunately, the announcement never came. Still, known journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-twilight-princess-wind-waker-switch-2022-metroid-prime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has often expressed</a> that he still expects both games to be released. In addition, VGC owner Andy Robinson <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> in the past that these titles are still coming to Nintendo's platform.</p>
<p>On X, known SEGA/Atlus leaker 'Midori' has now also mentioned the Twilight Princess Switch port while talking about a new project at Nintendo which might very well be related to a new Zelda. "There is a project at Nintendo with the codename Edward", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/mbkksstbhz5/status/1796403495291220346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. "This might be related to the rumors of a new Zelda series title."</p>
<p>When another X user said that this project might be related to Twilight Princess Remastered, 'Midori' basically <a href="https://x.com/mbkksstbhz5/status/1796403495291220346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> the years-long rumor about Nintendo sitting on Switch ports. "I do not know why Nintendo is not releasing it yet".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796378724985913396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> by the leaker on X, 'Edward' was Nintendo's codename for the 2019 Link's Awakening Switch remake from Grezzo.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to learn what Nintendo is cooking with regard to the Zelda franchise, especially with the current Switch now being in the final stage of its console cycle, and Nintendo having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that the Switch successor will be announced before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the Twilight Princess and Wind Waker ports that Nintendo is said to have been sitting on? Will they still be released on the current Switch or will Nintendo release them on the Switch successor as possible launch titles? And what about this rumored new Zelda project? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was initially released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. The game received an HD remaster for the Nintendo Wii U back in 2013. Twilight Princess was released as a cross-gen title for the GameCube and Wii in 2006. A remastered HD version of the game was released for the Wii U in 2016.</p>

  <p id="YRmAp7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is hosting the “<strong>Stadium Sights</strong>” event from <strong>June 1-4</strong> to coincide with the in-person Pokémon Go Fest: Sendai event. The event focuses on fighting- and flying-type Pokémon and brings a few nice bonuses with it.</p>
<p id="UyxDIi">You’ll get <strong>1.5x the candy and Stardust for hatching Pokémon from eggs</strong>. Emolga also makes its shiny debut, so if you ever wanted the slightly brown-tinted flying squirrel, this is your chance to grab it from eggs.</p>

<hr id="95uNG1">

<p id="AOouDH">This Timed Research, “Glide to Victory,” will only show up if you pay $1.99 to access it. Since it’s a Timed Research (as opposed to a Special Research), you will need to complete it before the event ends on June 4 at 8 p.m. in your local time to get all the rewards.</p>
<p id="YcQNdy">Is the “Glied to Victory” paid research worth it? Meh, not really. While you will get 2 Incubators, I’d only recommend buying this ticket if you really love Emolga and are desperate for a shiny one.</p>
<h3 id="yi7zeQ"><strong>‘Glide to Victory’ step 1 of 1</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="UeTMuf">Hatch an egg (1 Incubator)</li>
<li id="XDhT2V">Explore 5 km (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="4nmjMF">Spin 10 PokéStops (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="Oz0yLr">Catch 20 Pokémon (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="RcD4DD">Hatch 3 eggs (Emolga encounter)</li>
</ul>
<p id="QUZbAN"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 1 Super Incubator, an Emolga encounter, 20 Emolga Candy</p>
<hr id="KQ8QBs">
<h2 id="ZG4VHT"><strong>Pokémon Go ‘Stadium Sights’ event Field Research and rewards</strong></h2>
<p id="BoosSq">Spinning a PokéStop during the event period may yield one of these tasks:</p>

<li id="ZJvTaU">Explore 1 km (5 Poké Balls, 2 Great Balls, or 2 Razz Berries)</li>
<li id="uvoZT9">Spin 5 PokéStops (5 Poké Balls, 2 Great Balls, or 2 Razz Berries)</li>
</ul>
<hr id="V5rUuW">
<h2 id="eHKni2"><strong>Pokémon Go ‘Stadium Sights’ event boosted spawns</strong></h2>
<p id="gvDJIb">These Pokémon will spawn more frequently during the event period:</p>
<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-wait-ages-for-a-bus-and-then-two-come-along-at-once<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I<a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-eye-samurai-is-incredible-television" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote about <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> recently</a>. To open that blog, I said that my bar for sitting down with an animated series in 2023, let alone enjoying one, is <em>very </em>high, to the point where I hadn't seen a series as good as <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> in <em>years</em>. I don't know what’s in the water right now, but having gone so long between passions I'm about to write about the second piece of life-changing animation I've seen in the <em>same week</em>.</p><p><strong>UPDATE May 31, 2024</strong>: <em>The show has moved to Netflix this week after being let go by Max, so we've re-upped our 2023 review to help out anyone who hasn't seen it yet! </em></p><p>While I was gushing about <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> online and to friends, I kept getting told, "Yeah dude, but what about <em>Scavenger's Reign</em>, have you seen that?", to which I had to reply "No, but it looks incredible, I will definitely be checking it out after <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>". Well, with Mizu's adventure in the books over the weekend, I finally had the time to check <em>Scavengers Reign</em> out, and <em>holy shit</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scavengers" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TRzemJbUsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Running for seven minutes, this is <em>Scavengers</em>, the 2016 short (from the same creators) that started this whole thing off</figcaption></figure></div><p>This show is unreal. It's everything I've ever wanted from a sci-fi animated series. It's weird, it's wild, it's completely uninterested in doing things by the book. Imagine if Moebius sat down to make a sci-fi castaway series, then collaborated with Miyazaki on designing 117,000 weird little alien guys, and you feel mildly uncomfortable the <em>entire </em>time you're watching it. That's what <em>Scavengers Reign</em> is.</p><p>Set in the future, it tells the story of the survivors of the crew of the Demeter, a deep space colony ship that crashes on Vesta, a remote alien world. For most of the 12 episodes we're only following five people, split across three groups/storylines: Sam (the Demeter's captain) and Ursula (the ship's horticulturist), Azi (a cargo worker) and Levi (a robot) and finally Kamen, a guy who is...having some problems in his life that have not been helped by crash-landing and meeting some local wildlife.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scavengers Reign - Netflix Trailer Edit" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8sVMs8sq9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Things happen to these people. Some of them die, some of them don't, they meet some other people, stuff happens. Each survivor has a story to tell, but for me the highlight of the show wasn't narrative; It was <em>Scavengers Reign's</em> never-ending mission to show us as many weird little alien guys as possible.</p><p>As you can probably tell by glancing at even a single screenshot from this show, it looks <em>incredible</em>. The colours, the designs, this is a visual <em>feast</em>, and I mean no offence here to the writers--the story is fine!--to say that I could have sat down for all 12 episodes with the show on mute, just looking at the backgrounds, and I still would have had a good time.</p><p>Vesta itself is a sight to behold, but the real stars are the countless little freaks that have been designed and brought to life for <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. They're in every shot. The survivors can't take a step, sit down or touch a tree without disturbing some odd little creature that looks and behaves like nothing you have ever seen before.</p><p>They crawl then turn into balloons. They look like a tree but then turn into birds. They're birthed by flowers with lightbulb blooms, they're monkeys with shark teeth that can swim, they're axolotl with jedi mind powers. The creatures of Vesta are all just so weird, and unsettling, and they are absolutely essential to what makes <em>Scavengers Reign</em> so compelling, because this is supposed to be a show about being stranded on an alien planet, and these guys really make the situation feel <em>alien</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>One of my favourites are these disappearing bird things</figcaption></figure><p>I was equal amounts anxious and horrified in almost every damn scene in the entire series, because--as the show will quickly establish--this is an alien world! We don't know shit about it! Every flower can kill you, every cute little guy can kill you, the weather can kill you (spoilers: all three of these things kill loads of people). The situation these survivors are placed in is unknown and utterly terrifying to them, and I felt the exact same way throughout.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond their contextual purpose, though--and<a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/fine-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as someone who spends a lot of time just admiring little details like this</a>--I also just love the aliens from a visual standpoint. I'm in awe at the sheer breadth of variety and uniqueness among them. To sit through <em>Scavengers Reign </em>is to be introduced to dozens of types of animals you could never have previously conceived, and that is its own little joy. Hah, look at this guy. And get a load of this cute little weirdo! And his friend! Little visual thrills, all the way from beginning to end.</p><p>I'm so glad this show got made. It's 2023, I honestly would not have thought, in this age of streaming metrics and focus-tested banality, that a place like HBO would have given money and space for a Moebius-ass animated series about a bunch of colourful little Murder Muppets. Yet here we are!&nbsp;Thank you, everyone involved, however you got this made, you've made a show--and some little guys--who are going to stick with me for a very long time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168156/doctor-who-dot-bubble-review-new-episode-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="egnQvT">At first “Dot and Bubble,” the latest episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152946/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-costume"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>, seems to be borrowing from <em>Black Mirror</em>’s bag of tricks. It’s set on Finetime, a planet where everyone is accompanied by a small spherical AI assistant called a Dot, which projects a “Bubble” around their heads. Within their individual Bubbles, people live their entire lives — group chatting, watching funny videos or performances by pop stars — and they do not seem to leave except to sleep. Even walking is mediated by the Bubble, telling them how many paces to move in each direction, guiding them to the office, back home, and to meals. It’s a very “kids these days and their damn phones!” kind of premise, but again: only <em>at first</em>. </p>
<p id="LxQYg2">The initially blunt metaphor only gets blunter when the monster of the week is introduced: terrifying slug aliens that are eating the denizens of Finetime alive, as they obliviously walk into their gaping maws because they can’t see past their bubbles. Our heroine for the week, the hapless Lindy Pepper-Bean (Callie Cooke), finds her Bubble’s feed intruded on by the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) and Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), who spend the episode trying to remotely lead her to safety, in spite of her skepticism.</p>
<p id="ccQi8y">It’s a clever setup, one that hearkens back to fan-favorite <em>Doctor Who</em> stories like “Blink,” and tropes beloved by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23172599/steven-moffat-tv-doctor-who-sherlock">writers like Steven Moffat</a> (who, surprisingly, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161071/doctor-who-steven-moffat-boom">did not write this episode</a>): horrible things at the edge of one’s perception, a hard limit on the Doctor’s ability to intervene, and a world engineered for conformity, with safety dependent on characters’ ability to escape societal gravity. This canny structure clashes with the painfully patronizing metaphor at the heart of “Dot and Bubble” — which writer Russell T. Davies exploits to obscure what he’s <em>really</em> doing. </p>

<p id="EvrWvi">Because in between the seemingly lazy satire of the terminally online youth and the chilling thrills of its plot, Davies quietly drops pertinent details about Finetime and what is really happening here. Who are these people? What do they do? Why are they there? Each answer, delivered conversationally in an episode packed with a loud, candy-colored palette, louder social commentary, and one of the creepiest monsters of the season, barely registers. So when you finally get to the ending and the truth about Finetime is made clear, it’s like the floor opens out from underneath you, and “Dot and Bubble” immediately becomes one of the grimmest <em>Doctor Who</em> stories told in some time. </p>
<p id="0GeOIE">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This means spoilers<strong> </strong>for the very end of “Dot and Bubble.”]</p>
<p id="Dto4lz">In the end, there is no saving the people of Finetime. The first hint was in Lindy’s rapid dismissal of the Doctor’s warnings at the start of “Dot and Bubble,” and that she only began to listen when Ruby Sunday spoke to her. More hints piled up, leading to the answer of what brought the slug aliens to Finetime in the first place: the Dots. The Dots, in their algorithmic service to their users, learned <em>too much</em> about them, and grew to hate them. And it’s not because of their tech-addled brains blinding them to the real world; it’s because they’re fucking racist. </p>
<p id="k4hbIf">Lindy and the other Finetime survivors refuse to take the Doctor on his offer of safe passage away from Finetime, instead choosing to brave the wilds where they face certain death, just because of who the Doctor looks like. It’s here where the last tidbits fall into place: chilling glimpses of selfishness from Lindy, her lily-white friend group, the fact that Finetime is only inhabited by the young adult children of the 1%.</p>

<p id="faQeqo">Up until now, <em>Doctor Who</em> has been pretty unconcerned with how the Doctor taking on the appearance of a Black man might change the dynamic of the show. On the one hand, this is understandable, desirable even — it would be crass and arguably retrograde to immediately subject the Doctor to racism the moment it became a possible story outcome. It also feels intellectually dishonest to act as if it would <em>never </em>matter. Davies, as the white showrunner who engineered this situation, chose neither trauma porn nor avoidance. Instead he chose specificity: This is how the Doctor’s <em>job</em> is harder now. There are some people who don’t want to be saved by him. There are some problems that cannot be solved by cosmically deep wells of compassion and empathy. There are some people with hearts so mean they will not even save themselves. </p>
<p id="FDridg">“Dot and Bubble” argues that its hero’s role is to stand in the gap and help even in the face of such shocking contempt, because life is precious above all, even hateful little ones — presumably because life can be redeemed, and death is final. It’s hard to accept this, and Gatwa’s performance suggests that maybe such idealism isn’t deserved here. He laughs at the insanity of the situation, and then screams in anguish. Who knows if it’s the right call, but he made one. He tried. </p>

He goes on to say that he can brush off some of the comments, but "when there's a constant barrage of them, it's exhausting." And, when it came to Tales of Kenzera in particular, the situation reached "a fever pitch," especially as the game was roped into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/igda-statement-game-developers-harassment">ongoing harassment campaigns</a> targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts on social media.</p><p>"Don't get me wrong, there's been so much amazing and beautiful support for this game. The fact that it's inspired so many people and touched, you know, so many lives, it was one of our goals from the outset — to have this positive impact, right?" Salim says. "But at the same time, we are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat. From people who look across the vast landscape of modern media and decide that anything that doesn't speak to them or centers around them is unnecessary and inauthentic."</p><p>"And look," he continues, "there's always a reason why diverse stories can't exist. You know, it's always either we're doing it the wrong way or it's just there to tick boxes and it's just beginning to feel like there is no right way. You know, these exclusionary rules continue to stack up and the goalposts continue to shift until, you know, me, my studio, people who look like us, just sit down, be quiet and just accept the fact that you're outsiders. But I won't do that."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat.</p></div><p>"If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that game is still for you," Salim continues. "You know, if the characters are a different race or a different gender or you know, a different ideology or different perspective, that doesn't mean the game isn't for you. It can still be for you."</p><p>It's that philosophy, Salim says, that inspired him to set Tales of Kenzera at a more affordable price than many other games, going for $20 across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. But the harassment, he continues, has spurred him to make the price of the game even lower to try to make it more accessible to a larger audience. </p><p>He announces that, starting today, the price of Tales of Kenzera will be lower than $15 on Switch, giving Nintendo a shoutout for "acting fast on this."</p><p>"I'm working with the team in bringing this discount to all platforms and it's gonna start from now to until the end of June because, you know, it just means so much to me, man," he says.</p><p>"I believe this is just one way that I can show you how serious I am about this," he says. "Games are for everyone. Diverse games, they're not about taking something away from you. They're about adding something new because there's room for all of us."</p><p>Salim's statement comes at a time where the games industry has seen an uptick in harassment on social media, spurring the International Game Developers Association (IDGA) to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/igda-statement-game-developers-harassment">issue a statement on the matter in March</a>. At the time, the organization said it was "deeply concerned about the increased harassment of historically marginalized developers and those advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives."</p><p>Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is a side-scrolling action game that follows a young shaman named Zau as he embarks on capturing spirits of three monsters as offerings to Kalunga, the God of Death, so that he may revive his father. Salim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyzE90U43zw&amp;ab_channel=BBCNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been open about the fact</a> that the game was inspired by the death of his own father, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">in our review</a>, IGN called it a "touching love letter from a grieving son to their deceased father, told in clever and moving allegories about sending restless spirits to the afterlife, that helps it stand out in the pack."</p><p>In his video today, Salim concludes by sending a message to other developers who have told personal stories that "uplift the marginalized and underrepresented."</p><p>"Your work is so important, so important today," he says. "Whether you realize it or not, you are actually setting an example for the next generation of developers, of creators, of artists, just take that in. Keep doing what you're doing. Thank you."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

<p id="w08rCl"><strong>Genre: </strong>Horror<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 59m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Arkasha Stevenson<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Nell Tiger Free, Sônia Braga, Ralph Ineson</p>
<p id="C1vqXt">A prequel to the 1976 <em>Omen</em>, <em>The First Omen</em> is actually surprisingly scary and good. </p>
<p id="X5dL44">From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090384/best-horror-movies-2024-how-scary">best horror movies of the year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="quvcFJ"><em>The First Omen</em> is impressively scary, with dread seeping into every frame of its Catholic conspiracy. Ralph Ineson uses his excellent voice to great effect here as a priest who has been excommunicated after finding out the Church’s secrets, but it’s Free who winds up the standout, as her character slowly spirals as the plot gets thicker and more confounding.</p></blockquote>

<p id="zAPbyG"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dystopian action comedy<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 51m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Moritz Mohr<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Bill Skarsgård, Jessica Rothe, Michelle Dockery</p>
<p id="ugwDco">A young man in a gritty dystopian future who has a love of video games is sent on a mission to destroy the city’s totalitarian ruler. From <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24141885/boy-kills-world-review-video-game-movie-bill-skarsgard">our review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="JBgThF">The film was largely built strictly for a specific brand of video game movie fans: It’s a checklist of retro beat-’em-up references and meta comedy tropes that some audiences are inevitably going to find broad, excessive, and off-putting, and some are going to find playful and energizing.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Call of Duty is one of gaming's biggest series. Xbox Game Pass is one of gaming's biggest services. It only makes sense then that one of Xbox's priorities--particularly after purchasing Call of Duty's publisher, Activision--was ensuring the next title in the series is available on Game Pass.</p><p>Fortunately for Xbox and Call of Duty fans already subscribed to Game Pass, Microsoft recently confirmed that the next Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, will be included in the subscription service. Yet we can't help but wonder if having Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass will actually move the needle for Microsoft. Sure, Call of Duty has a built in, loyal fanbase, but will fans who traditionally play on other consoles be motivated to enter the Microsoft ecosystem? Will those not wanting to shell out $70 to purchase the game outright be attracted by Game Pass' lower price point? </p><p>On this week’s Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss that state of Microsoft and AAA gaming in general, the potential for a Game Pass price hike, and whether they think BLOPS 6 will be the title to give Game Pass a much needed shot in the arm. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLsnSrZaPY8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jLsnSrZaPY8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door secret character</h2><p dir="ltr">Ms. Mowz, the badge shop owner and self-proclaimed Badge Ninja, is the seventh playable party member and one you can completely miss if you don’t do a specific side quest. The side quest featuring Ms Mowz only unlocks after you return to Rogueport <strong>following the conclusion of Chapter 4 in Twilight Town</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Head to the Trouble Center on the city’s eastern side, and pick up the “Elusive Badge” side quest there. Climb up to the roof of Zess T’s house, and you’ll meet "??? the questgiver," who’s very obviously just Ms Mowz without her signature bow.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Elusive Badge quest</h2><p dir="ltr">She tasks you with finding an elusive badge “in Hooktail’s room” and believes the secret to finding said badge is in the power of the wind. Hooktail’s Room is the same room where you fought the giant dragon in Chapter 1, so make your way back to the Petalburg Outskirts and into Hooktail Castle again.</p><p dir="ltr">The journey is a bit of a slog, since all the enemies--minus Hooktail--are back again. The puzzles are all solved, though. Don’t waste your time defeating enemies unless you just want a fight. By this part of your journey, you’ll only earn one Star Point for each enemy, so it’s not really worth the time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311376" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311376"></a><figcaption>There's no fold or seam for this one, so it might take a few tries to get the position just right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Climb the castle, cross the bridge, and hoist yourself up the tower staircase and into Hooktail’s room. Walk to the room’s center, and bring Flurrie out from the Partner Wheel, if she’s not with you already. Use her field skill to blow away a hidden paper panel to reveal a chest. Unlike most panels in The Thousand-Year Door, this one has no visible edges. You might need to reposition Mario and Flurrie to get the angle just right.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is Ms Mowz worth it in The Thousand-Year Door?</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes, but possibly not for the reasons you might expect. Her combat abilities are a solid mix of offense--a slap attack that ignores enemy defense, for example--and support, including a skill that restores 10 HP to Mario. However, her field skill is what makes Ms Mowz such a good companion to have around. She can sniff out treasure.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll notice Ms Mowz lift her nose in the air when you approach a hidden treasure, and she becomes visibly more animated as you get closer. The Thousand-Year Door is littered with hidden treasure, especially in the final few chapters, so having someone around to lead you in the right direction is a big help.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, most of those hidden treasures are just Star Pieces, but if you want some of the best badges in the game, you’ll need plenty of Star Pieces to buy them with.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s probably a good idea to save your Shine Sprites for another party member, though. Ms Mowz’s damage output can’t compete with the likes of Bobbery, Vivian, or even Koops, so only upgrade her when you’re finished with everyone else.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-2-remake-maria-outfit-sexy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday during an online presentation from Konami, we got a new trailer and a look at the gameplay for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake developed by Bloober Team. I have concerns.</p><p>I’m not going to sugar coat this: being a <em>Silent Hill</em> fan is pain. The current offerings for the franchise are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uneven at best</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-ascension-pepe-silvia-funny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unintentionally hilarious at worst</a>. In many ways, the franchise is still living in the shadow of Konami’s last false start—the canceled Hideo Kojima-directed <em>Silent Hills</em>, which players only got to experience in the form of the “playable teaser” <em>P.T.</em>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjvw3/five-years-later-its-nearly-impossible-to-play-horror-classic-pt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is now unavailable to play at all</a>. A remake of the beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em> feels like an attempt to win back the crowd from Konami. But based on what we’ve seen so far, I am not sure that Bloober Team really understand why this series and this game specifically have inspired such long term obsession from fans.</p><p>All of the basic pieces of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> are present. James Sunderland still receives a message from his dead wife Mary, telling him to meet her in Silent Hill, their “special place.” He still wanders through decrepit buildings in the dark, the atmosphere slowly changing around him as he goes deeper into the horrors. The gameplay showcase and trailer portray many specific beats from the original version of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, including James following a strange little girl into a creepy school, the unrelenting fog, and beating a monster to death with a four by four with nails stuck in it. </p><p>But it also features new, unfamiliar additions to the game. The original game had a fixed camera, which has now been changed to a third person, movable camera. Both versions of the game have a sparse UI, but the original had these charming, chunky serif fonts that are now replaced with something smoother and more modern. Most jarringly, the characters look subtly different and the facial animations, while expressive, sometimes go over the top. These are all concessions to modernity—I also just don’t like them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SILENT HILL 2 - Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P10BzlgLjz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Silent Hill</em> is all about mood and tone. It’s about echoing footsteps and barely lit hallways—and especially about the subtextual representations of James’ psyche that the world of Silent Hill projects around him. If you get that wrong, then the whole story kind of falls apart, or at least won’t have the same impact as the original.&nbsp;</p><p>In Konami’s presentation about the state of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, Bloober Team’s creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart said something to that effect, but in a way that makes me frustrated: “Our goal from the very beginning was to maintain the game’s atmosphere, while modernizing the gameplay to make it competitive in 2024.”</p><p>I know there’s an element of nostalgia in not wanting to see the modern UI elements Bloober Team showed and in preferring the dithered pixels of the Playstation 2 era graphics. But more than that, there are specific design choices in Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake that are just baffling. In particular, I straight up hate what they did to Maria. Instead of wearing a cropped cardigan, choker and mini skirt—famously, the exact same outfit Christina Aguilera wore to the 1999 Teen Choice Awards—she wears a sensible A-line dress and maroon leather jacket. As one of my Twitter followers said, <a href="https://twitter.com/taufmonster/status/1796566872936358112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she looks like a side character from the sitcom <em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>. The vibes are rancid.</p><p>Spoilers for the 23 year old <em>Silent Hill 2</em> but, in the old game, Maria looks exactly like James’ dead wife Mary. She’s a classic femme fatale, which is an enduring character archetype that originates in pulp fiction and film noir. She’s sexy, she uses that sexuality to further her own goals, she’s got a secret and she plays all her cards very close to her chest. More than that, she’s also part of the psychological trap that Silent Hill has set for James. All of the monsters—the sexy nurses, the two pairs of women’s legs stuck to each other, even the infamous Pyramid Head—are manifestations of his desire for his wife and his resentment of her illness. Maria is all that guilt and desire made flesh. Against the bleak, foggy landscape of Silent Hill, her pink leopard print pencil skirt is a specific temptation to him, a projection of his sexual attraction to his wife and his hatred of her for not being fuckable on her deathbed.</p><p>While I can understand some hesitance to recreate Maria’s old outfit, I’m frustrated because, well, every single element of that outfit is currently on trend. Every time I leave my house, I see beautiful women dressing either like Christina Aguilera in 1999 or my older brother in 2001 when he was a huge Korn fan (cargo pants! I could not have predicted the cargo pant revival!). Nostalgia for that period of time is at its peak with the generation younger than me, and that’s reflected in fashion.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Christina Aguilera Teen Choice Awards 1999" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LatcgQB9aQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can buy a pink cropped cardigan, usually styled without a shirt underneath, <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/textured-crop-cardigan/7806836?color=PINK&amp;size=small&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=seo_shopping&amp;utm_channel=low_nd_seo_shopping&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqpOu1kkaUlWtFLEwPLFcVunm0XRadFVE1yEZYBZoZQg8h5fjZZhSg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Nordstrom right now</a>. Cropped cardigans are <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g35491708/best-cropped-cardigans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an inescapable trend</a> that have been in style for most of last year <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/style/g44899321/best-cropped-cardigans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and all of this one</a>. Similarly, animal prints like leopard print are back in style. As noted in <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/leopard-print-revival-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this analysis from <em>Vogue</em></a>, you can trace this trend back to Mel B, also known as Scary Spice from the Spice Girls, who wore leopard print like it was her official uniform, as well as the ongoing <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/indie-sleaze-revival-vogue-fashion-writers-debate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“indie sleaze” revival</a> that is basically an attempt to recapture the version of New York City that made me want to move here. Chokers are on trend right now—you can <a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/a46991583/fall-2024-jewelry-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust this article about jewelry trends from Elle</a> or just take a look at almost any female streamer on Twitch. Non-functional statement belts are also back in style, to my chagrin, and their trendiness was noted as recently as <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-belts-from-the-fall-2024-season-in-street-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this 2024 fall/winter fashion week street style feature from Vogue</a>. This is an outfit hot women wear, in real life, in the current day. It didn’t need updating! Maria could do a photoshoot for Vogue at this exact moment in time.</p><p>I am not the only fan upset by the change to Maria’s outfit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bobvids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber BobVids</a>, also known as Bob, is a prolific and enthusiastic fan of the franchise. Over Discord messages, he told me a little about his issues with this redesign, which he called an “unforced error.”</p><p>“I've never seen so many people collectively saddened to not see leopard print and that's for a good reason,” he said.</p><p>But Bob said that it’s about more than just fidelity to the original. It’s about how Maria as a character plays into the entire story of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. He also noted that some of the character animations in the trailer appear to portray Maria as more subdued and demure than she is in the original game, where she is not shy about her sexuality and the effect it has on others.</p><p>“To me, Maria is intimidating as hell. She's confident, crafty, sexy, and she knows it. She's intimidating <em>because </em>she knows it,” Bob said. “One of the first things Maria does in the original game is take James' hand and put it on her chest while saying ‘feel how warm I am?’”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Meeting Maria HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrrMlC14LNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“There's a reason Maria is in the town with James, and it has a lot to do with how James feels about his late wife and women in general,” he continued. “The changes in Maria's outfit and attitude seem to signify not only how Bloober Team want to alter Maria, but also how they are changing James to alter or outright remove aspects of his personality that are central themes of the game that fans have been mentally chewing on for decades now.”</p><p>This is all to say: not only is Maria’s outfit from the original game an important aspect of her character and James’ story arc, it is a perfectly realistic, even fashionable outfit for a woman to wear in 2024. Not to be melodramatic, but the way that Bloober Team have missed the mark on how this character’s sexuality is visually expressed as well as the actual reality of what people wear in 2024 to signify sexiness makes me want to yell into a paper bag. This should have been a no-brainer, but we ended up with a character who looks like a sensible lawyer trying on an o-ring choker because her step-daughter said they were cool as opposed to a physical manifestation of James Sunderland’s misogyny.</p><p>I would love Konami and Bloober Team to help usher in a revival of <em>Silent Hill</em> as a franchise. I love the shit out of <em>Silent Hill</em>, and I’ve long wanted to show my husband, who has never played it, what makes the games so special. It would be amazing if this remake hit the same notes that the original did in 2001. But right now, I feel like I’m wading through the fog, desperately longing for something, not yet knowing that my ironic punishment is that I’ll get what I want, but not in the way I wanted it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, after the dust has settled and people have had time to play it, the general sentiment is that it’s pretty good. I’ve enjoyed it a lot. And I also appreciate that it also doesn’t take up 200GB of space on my console’s SSD. But this is 2024 and people can’t just live in the moment and enjoy something. No, we must think about the future. What’s next for <em>XDefiant</em>? Ubisoft gave us a vague road map, but a dataminer has provided more information. In fact, they’ve shared too much, it seems, as Ubisoft has reportedly used DMCA takedowns to remove some of their online leaks. </p><h2 id="h79188"><a id=""></a>New factions, weapons, and modes coming to <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>Over on Twitter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user Rogue TX</a></span> has been sharing what seems to be datamined content and files from <em>XDefiant. </em>This leaked content appears to provide us with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clear road map</a></span> for what to expect during the shooter’s first year. Assuming nothing changes, these are the first four factions coming to the shooter over the next 12 months or so:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Assassins from<em> Assassin’s Creed</em></li><li>Operators from <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></li><li>GSG9 members from<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em></li><li>The Highwaymen from <em>Far Cry: New Dawn</em></li></ul><p>Rogue TX was able to find in-game assets—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including icons</a></span>, map names, character renders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animations, and more</a></span>—indicating that <em>XDefiant</em>’s current plans for the coming year include these additions. (But keep in mind that plans change and game development is messy, so some or all of this might not happen.) </p><p>Beyond that, Rogue TX also found data suggesting that team deathmatch, capture the flag, and infection are new game modes that Ubisoft is currently planning to bring to <em>XDefiant </em>in a future update. Also found inside <em>XDefiant</em>’s files are some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possible new weapons</a></span>, including a sawed-off shotgun, Tommy Gun, FAMAS, turret, RC car, FAL, and G36 rifle. </p><p>But perhaps the weirdest stuff found by Rogue TX inside the game are indications that factions based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crew</em></a></span>—Ubisoft’s open-world driving game—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabbids are planned, too</a></span>.

He says they set out to make the game, simply titled Astro Bot, to be big, adding that it represents more than just the start of Asobi’s new future with PlayStation.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story."</p></div><p>"We wanted to make a big game," Doucet said. "This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story. We call it Astro Bot because we treat this as a new beginning. That's a really, really big game. I think for us, that's the biggest game we've ever made."</p><p>PlayStation’s Astro Bot mascot has largely stayed out of the spotlight for the last few years. Some players may recognize the adorable little blue-and-white friend from the PSVR-exclusive Astro Bot Rescue Mission or, more recently, Astro’s Playroom, a game granted to PlayStation 5 owners for free. While these titles flew under the radar for many, they’ve still managed to impress those who checked them out (we gave Rescue Mission a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/astro-bot-rescue-mission-review"><u>9/10</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Playroom</u></a> an 8/10).</p><p>Astro Bot finally stepped up when the series’ standalone title was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-astro-bot-game-revealed"><u>revealed during yesterday’s May 2024 State of Play presentation</u></a>. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/astro-bot-arrives-on-ps5-september-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation has already confirmed</u></a> the project features more than 80 levels that will see players trekking across forests, deserts, volcanos, and more. The footage we’ve seen so far teases an ambitious outing for Sony’s versatile little robot, but not everything is completely new.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Astro Bot will also continue a trend set up in previous installments by including references to other PlayStation titles. Where Astro’s Playroom had players digging for shoutouts to games from across the company’s history, yesterday’s reveal trailer put robot versions of characters like Nathan Drake, Kratos, Ico, and many more front and center. There’s no telling just how many easter eggs are waiting, especially considering Asobi teased that it doubled down on its cast this time around.</p><p>"It's a kind of eye candy," Doucet added. "There's going to be more. We're going to be talking over time about what they mean to the game, but, yes, there's going to be a big reunion. There's a lot of characters from the PlayStation universe crossing over with Astro's path. It's an Astro Bot story, of course, with Astro being the main character, but there's a lot of PlayStation characters that play a part."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Reveal Trailer Screenshots - State of Play 2024</h3></div></output><p>Asobi was officially <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo"><u>welcomed under the PlayStation umbrella in 2021</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As a traditionally parkour-heavy series with a main character who often has a difficult time dying when it counts, a roguelike Prince of Persia game feels like a concept that was simply waiting for an execution. Pair that intuitive idea with Evil Empire, the developers behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/11/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells</a>, and you’ve got an ideal coupling for Ubisoft’s second sidescrolling Prince of Persia of 2024. But while The Rogue Prince of Persia has a lot of potential, at this stage in its Early Access life, there doesn’t seem to be quite enough to hang onto for this time loop adventure to really shine yet. I still have more to play before I put a final score on it, but what I’ve seen so far is a skeleton of a roguelite adventure that will entertain for a few hours, but already lacks the variety to motivate me beyond that.</p><p>The initial and easiest comparisons that can be made for The Rogue Prince of Persia are to assume it is either <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">The Lost Crown</a> with roguelite elements or Dead Cells with an emphasis on parkour movement, and neither of those descriptions wholly encompasses how it actually plays. Without losing its roguelite roots, this new go-round for the Prince puts more of an emphasis on the titular character’s fighting capabilities across a myriad of weapons. Enemies come in many shapes and forms, with both shielded and unshielded varieties, and require every technique at the Prince’s disposal to get through each fight unscathed. Every charge attack, drop attack, or vault over an enemy helps keep your health bar pristine until an inevitable boss fight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Rogue Prince of Persia - Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The combat is so involved that it can end up feeling overwhelming at times. An unlucky fall into a group of enemies can be devastating to your life total, and even a good plan to destroy enemy shields can still fall apart when there are too many grouped up to discern between them. When two or three hits can completely decimate a run, it starts to feel like the platforming takes an unnecessary backseat to the combat.</p><p>The story, at the launch of Early Access, is edging on non-existent. The Prince wishes to save his kingdom from invading and seemingly magical Huns, so he takes off toward the castle with a magic bola in tow. The bola keeps returning him back in time to when he first set after the Huns, meaning that the Prince is afforded opportunity after opportunity to free his homeland. It also means he is forever stuck in a loop where he may never truly have enough time to make it there. It’s an intriguing setup that could be a great launching pad for more characters to steal the show, but there’s too little to grab onto currently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At this point, the supporting cast has no variety and no depth.</p></div><p>A cast of characters supports the Prince along the way, but at this point, they have no variety and no depth. Azadeh, the leader of the village you set out from, only has dialogue that feels vaguely nonsensical at the moment, clearly waiting until she can either be updated or given more lines before they make sense. Other characters move to the Prince’s camp, which protects those individuals from losing their memory while rewinding time, but very little is made of or by this convenient contrivance. There is plenty of time and opportunity to expand all of this in future updates, but it is a bit of a bummer to start the adventure and feel very little motivation to do right by this merry troupe of one-dimensional misfits.</p><p>At least The Rogue Prince of Persia is lovely to look at, styled like a Sasanian era painting come to life. Smooth animations and bright colors meld into a satisfying aesthetic, even if things look best while in motion and a little awkward when standing still. The environments not only look pleasant, but read well with necessary immediacy as you sprint and fight, which is important considering not every background surface lets you run on it to your heart’s content. I am somewhat puzzled as to why every character has purple skin, but I assume that is more of a stylistic choice than a malicious one. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At this juncture, there is no voice acting to speak of for any of The Rogue Prince of Persia’s characters, including the Prince himself. This does not feel like a huge loss right now as there is very little story for actors to voice anyway. It doesn’t help the already flat characters feel any less paper-thin, though, and makes it that much easier to run past them without caring what they have to say.</p><p>The music is somewhat relaxed and in the background, never really taking focus away. It’s not bad, but it is a bit of a disappointment when held up against other Prince of Persia games. I can understand how anything bombastic might get tiring over repeated playthroughs, but I would still prefer some catchy tracks to go alongside running up walls and vaulting over enemy soldiers.. </p><p>However, all of the good and bad of specifics like that is largely a wash under the criticism that there is simply not enough at The Rogue Prince of Persia’s Early Access launch to hold my attention very long. It does not take more than a few hours to get strong enough through crafting and leveling up gear – which lets you do stuff like create pools of oil to stymie enemies or slowly poison them with clouds of gas – to surmount the first major boss, and the encounters after that follow suit. I genuinely had a fun time getting through the areas and fights that are currently available, but it’s hard to recommend for anyone who does not care about watching this adventure take shape. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After 10 hours, I feel like I've more or less seen what it has to throw at me.</p></div><p>After about 10 hours, I feel like I have more or less seen what it has to throw at me. I expect the remainder of the Early Access period to introduce new areas, fights, items, and more, which is good because it definitely needs them. I am still pushing to get to the end of what’s here at launch before I give a final verdict, but I can already tell there is not enough variety – among encounters, among environments, among builds – to keep me entertained through the repeated runs this genre is supposed to be defined by.  </p><p>It will undoubtedly be fascinating to watch The Rogue Prince of Persia fill out as time goes on, as it ultimately needs more than just new content: It needs the kind of variety that makes each run feel truly different. With a slick presentation and a strong combat system, all the right pieces are there for success, so I’m at least optimistic. The Rogue Prince of Persia could have what it takes to one day become the next major roguelite favorite, but it’s a bit far from that goal where it sits now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also made its way into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cocoon-culmination-of-spheres-was-one-of-this-years-most-enchanting-moments/1100-6519920/" data-ref-id="1100-6519920">our 2023 spotlight series that looked back on memorable moments in games</a> thanks to the way navigating and solving Cocoon's puzzles makes the player feel like a genius. The game initially launched as a digital-only game, but this new physical release will hopefully give even more folks a chance to try this engrossing sci-fi adventure.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>If you haven't played the latest mainline Pokemon games, you can pick up the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F196128828741%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338974509%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-big-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-double-pack%2F1100-6509831%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Double Pack</a> for $90 on eBay. You're saving $30 off list price with this bundle ($15 per game). Scarlet and Violet are part of a small group of Switch games that only rarely drop below $50, so this is a pretty solid deal, especially if multiple members of your household like Pokemon. If this deal sells out, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPokemon-Scarlet-Pokemon-Violet-Dual-Pack-Nintendo-Switch%2F1545999884%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-big-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-double-pack%2F1100-6509831%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart has the bundle for $100</a>.</p><p>You don't have to play both of them to get the full Pokemon experience, so if you're looking to share the experience with a friend or family member, here's an easy way to do so. Plus, you'll be able to easily trade the Pokemon that are exclusive to each game.</p><p>While there are still some technical issues with the first truly open world entry in the series, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is still a great entry in the series and features dozens of new Pokemon to catch, raise, and evolve as you explore a new land influenced by the sunny environments of Spain.</p><p>"While Pokemon Legends: Arceus dipped its toes into what an open-world Pokemon game could be, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully embrace it," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-scarlet-violet-review-a-braviary-new-world/1900-6417994/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review</a>. "This new approach to the tried-and-true Pokemon formula reinvigorates the mainline series and delivers one of the most challenging and rewarding Pokemon adventures to date."</p><p>It's worth noting that this double pack does not contain the two Scarlet and Violet expansions. If you're eager to play the complete Scarlet and Violet experience, there are physical editions of each game that come with DLC vouchers.

                <p dir="ltr">343 is finally adding Match Composer to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/"> Halo Infinite</a>, a multiplayer feature previously seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/">The Master Chief Collection</a> that makes finding a game much easier. Match Composer will launch alongside the latest Operation on June 4.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in a<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/match-composer-preview" rel="nofollow "> Halo blog post</a>, Match Composer is a feature that allows players to find very specific kinds of matches. For example, if someone is looking for Team Slayer, a 4v4 game, all they have to do is select those, and they'll be launched into a queue looking for that specific game type.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post explains that every mode will be turned on by default. So, players must turn off which game modes they don't want to look for. It's worth pointing out that if players are looking for a very specific game, it may take longer to find a match than someone with every mode turned on.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that most social playlists will have Match Composer, but players cannot use this feature when playing Ranked. Since Match Composer will not be in Ranked, the following modes will be expanded: Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and Ranked Tactical.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Halo content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-halo-limited-edition-needler-nerf-blaster-for-lowest-price-yet-while-supplies-last/1100-6518314/">our story detailing how you can get your hands on a Needler Nerf Blaster for a discounted price</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more.886926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Jade Shadows is the next known update coming to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a></em>, revisiting the Stalker, introducing the new frame, and significant reworks in the game’s mechanics. In the 180th DevStream, we had a good look into what’s to come in the update.</p> <h2 id="h-warframe-jade-shadows-release-date" data-injectable="false"><em>Warframe </em>Jade Shadows release date</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">The Jade Shadows update will be coming to <em>Warframe </em>on <strong>June 18 on all platforms</strong>. It’ll be in the style of a typical update where we get a quest, a new frame, a new game mode, new weapons, balance changes, quality-of-life improvements, and several tweaks.</p> <figure data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Warframe | Jade Shadows Official Teaser" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wvtic5hMEd0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect in Jade Shadows</h2> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">While this may be a traditional <em>Warframe </em>update, <strong>Jade Shadows will be a cinematic quest that will last roughly up to 25 minutes</strong>. It’ll focus on what happens to The Stalker post-New War while introducing Jade.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">Because of this, you will have to progress through the game’s questline up until the completion of The New War. The dev team at Digital Extremes also requests that <strong>players be mindful of spoilers when this is released</strong>, so it’ll be important for upcoming expansions.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Status rework</h2> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">One of the bigger tweaks coming in this update has to be the <strong>rework to the Blast, Cold, and Magnetic status effects</strong>. Right now, the elements pertaining to Toxin and its combinations reign supreme along with Fire. The aforementioned procs are to be reworked in a way that brings them up to snuff.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">It’s too soon to tell if this will flip the meta entirely, but it does already sound like it’s making every elemental combination viable in the endgame.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Warframe </em>Jade Shadows new game mode</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Along with the quest and status rework, there will be a new game mode coming to Warframe called <strong>“Ascension”</strong>. It seems to be a multiple-phase game mode where you first defend an objective, then go into an elevator and escort an objective with you.</p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">From this elevator part, you have to power the mechanism up with batteries while avoiding a bunch of hazards and hard-hitting enemies. Should you fall or mess up, you must climb back up and maintain the energy of the elevator going upward.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">The final part seems to borrow from the mechanics of the Hijack mode where you then have to escort a moving payload and prevent it from being destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">So, in short, this game mode will require players to be very mobile, utilizing all the movement techniques in <em>Warframe</em>. At the same time, they have to sport a decent build that can take down tough enemies.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">There will also be an event tied to this mode as the update comes out called<strong> Belly of the Beas</strong>t. Rewards include Arcane Enhancements from previous events and more.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Additional things coming with Jade Shadows</h2> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">There will be huge <strong>UI improvements</strong> coming to Jade Shadows like missions depicting enemy resistance and weaknesses. You’ll also be able to edit your loadout while at the Star Chart menu for a more streamlined mission approach.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Many more improvements to the new user experience will be made that will benefit veterans too. Such things include damage numbers and how they’re displayed, polarity matching, fast travel menus, and more. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="false">Finally, we’ll be getting <strong>new Augment mods for Protea, Qorvex, Dagath, and Sevagoth</strong>. There’s so much to unpack for fans of the upcoming frame and those who will be affected by the status reworks.</p>

  <p id="JcA3CL"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167434/playstation-sony-state-of-play-ps5-showcase-announcements-trailers">Thursday’s PlayStation State of Play</a> kicked off the fleet of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">direct-to-player showcases happening this June</a> with several long-awaited trailers and updates, including a first look at gameplay for <em>Infinity Nikki — </em>a fashion-themed open-world RPG that expands on the characters from the popular mobile games, including <em>Love Nikki</em> and <em>Shining Nikki</em>.</p>
<div id="nDj02J"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0oiJJRZF4I?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="mrF5WC">The game doesn’t have a release date yet, but developer Papergames announced at State of Play that testing will begin in Q3 of 2024. The trailer includes tons of elements to get excited about: incredibly sharp AAA-level graphics, whimsical settings and costumes, and pastel-washed puzzles and challenges. Plus the game will be available on PS5 as soon as it’s released.</p>
<p id="BSF1fA">But folks might be even more excited about <em>Infinity Nikki</em> after watching clips from IGN reporter Daniel Robson’s three-hour demo of the game. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview">Robson’s preview</a> includes tons of exciting artwork and cutscenes from the game, but the glowing review of the gameplay is what will likely get both Legend of Zelda players and <em>Love Nikki</em> fans excited to get their hands on this for themselves.</p>

<p id="WJwQ7g">Robson says players will be able to customize the lead character’s outfits to a degree that rivals <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and then use a high-powered in-game camera to shoot cute photos of them. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the sun-bleached landscape (as Robson calls it “Hyrule as interpreted by Studio Ghibli”) from your perch on a magical glider, ride your bike through the countryside, and use your tools to catch materials for crafting new clothes and items.</p>
<p id="xQwb5I">The cheek-pinching cuteness of the game doesn’t take away from its weight as a challenging and engaging game, though (a dynamic other cozy open-worlds often suffer from, in my opinion). Robson reports that the Zelda-like puzzles and “shrines” are challenging without being frustrating, and well worth the payoff at the end — stunning animations that show off the level you’ve just beat. </p>
<p id="kFhmDU">There’s also some combat, including battles with monsters and other creatures that drop materials you can use to sketch and craft new outfits. The game will also eventually include online features, but IGN reported they won’t be available at launch.</p>
<p id="CNalOF">As aforementioned, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> developers say it’ll be ready for testing around July 2024, and it’ll debut on PS5 at launch. IGN previously reported that the game will also be available on PC, Xbox Series X, iOS, and Android, but the developers haven’t released an official full list of consoles.</p>

To some, this moment means everything, but there are others who couldn’t even begin to understand the magnitude of it all. That’s because <em>Destiny</em>’s lore, much as I love it, is nearly impossible to glean in obvious ways.

Every major plot beat in the game, from the earliest moments of the first <em>Destiny </em>all the way to the currently ending season, has made the cut. Even elements of story that occur before the first game are featured in the video. The whole thing is immense, daunting, and also thoroughly necessary.</p><p>Byf’s video, which does feature timestamps and should probably be viewed episodically, begins by establishing the world of <em>Destiny</em>, its many factions and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272">characters</a></span>, and the history that shapes it before we jump into the first game. The events of the original title make up the shortest parts of the video, accounting for about five chapters over the course of about an hour. The bulk of the story really begins to kick into gear at the beginning of <em>Destiny 2</em>, once Bungie more or less figured out a direction for the more ambiguous elements of the franchise, like the enigmatic Darkness, and introduced seasonal stories, which are coincidentally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-seasons-episode-burnout-eververse-1850762447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-seasons-episode-burnout-eververse-1850762447">being phased out</a></span> next week.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-story-from-destiny-s-hidden-lore-1728113953&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-story-from-destiny-s-hidden-lore-1728113953">incredibly Cool™ lore</a></span>, but both installments in the series have fumbled its presentation. The first game would direct players to read Grimoire cards—which contained dense and pulpy sci-fi novellas—that could only be found on the <em>Destiny </em>app, meaning there was little to no way for anyone to find the game’s most interesting writing within <em>Destiny </em>itself. <em>Destiny 2 </em>has done a much better job of giving players codexes that are packed with books detailing ongoing conflicts and other interesting lore tidbits from around the galaxy. However, these tomes are buried beneath <em>Destiny 2</em>’s poor and convoluted UI, which only gets worse the more you look at it, and is fortunately being streamlined in <em>The Final Shape</em>, among <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397">countless</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573">other</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573">changes</a></span>.<br></p><p>While Bungie’s toiled away at mechanisms to better implement its own interesting background stories into the actual <em>Destiny </em>games, it has also been telling an ongoing story with <em>a lot </em>of moving parts and big ol’ proper nouns. Matters have only worsened on this front considering how many stories have been stripped from the game and tossed into a vault, like all of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s seasonal storytelling and the vanilla campaign that it launched with! It’s hard to manage a game, but it is even harder to get into <em>Destiny </em>and its narrative due to how acutely its developers have bungled it all in the ensuing years.

Whenever I’ve fallen away from the game, Byf’s lore videos have always managed to get me caught back up and reminded me of one of the reasons I’ve loved these games for almost ten years. It could have the same <em>magical </em>effect on you all.</p><p><em>The Final Shape </em>is out next week.

                <p dir="ltr">As Sony continues to bring many of its acclaimed PlayStation console exclusives to PC, each release seems to be getting better in terms of quality and stability. Ghost of Tsushima is the latest to uphold this trend, with developer Nixxes showing yet again how valuable of a purchase it was in the pursuit of this PC-focused endeavor. Taking the work done by Sucker Punch on the PlayStation 4 and translating it to a smooth PC experience might sound trivial in the face of more demanding projects such as Returnal and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, but it doesn't make the final product any less impressive when you're able to get it running far beyond even the PlayStation 5 version's level of visuals and performance.</p><div

PSN account to play) and the entertaining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-iki-island-expansion-review-sins-of-the-father/1900-6417714/">Iki Island DLC</a> that extends protagonist Jin Sakai's adventure. There's a lot to play here, especially taking into account the scope of the main adventure. It's a story that takes some time to get going, but fully earns its pacing through moments such as the breath-taking late title card screen and captivating set-piece battles that bookend its main acts. Ghost of Tsushima's open-world design feels slightly old given the time since its original release, but it's no less captivating to make your way across the gorgeous island the game takes place on.</p><p dir="ltr">On PC, Tsushima looks better than ever, too. There are some small improvements that help its visuals surpass those of the PS5 version, including some upgrades to volumetric fog and smaller visual enhancements to make the world look sharper to the eye. It's hard to pick these out without a direct comparison to the console version, however, with Nixxes holding back large changes such as ray-traced lighting or global illumination, which is disappointing given how both have become commonplace in modern games. Ghost of Tsushima side-steps its age with a timeless visual design. Colors are vibrant and accentuated, bringing to life forests laden with warm autumn hues and providing an eye-catching contrast between the lush wildlife and the oppressive Mongol structures that have started infecting it.</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring this world is improved significantly with the additional fluidity that playing on PC can offer. On my AMD Ryzen 5600X and RTX 3080 Ti, I was pleasantly surprised to see such high frame rates at much higher resolutions than the PS5 could offer, with a native 4K hovering well above 80fps for much of my playtime. This gives Ghost of Tsushima a lot of room for scaling down to much older hardware, albeit with the caveat that it plays best on graphics cards with more than 8GB of VRAM, which can be a limiting factor. Still, the range of visual settings on offer lets you refine your experience to achieve the performance you want, with real-time changes to the world letting you sample your tweaks as you make them in the menu. Ghost of Tsushima felt great on PS4, was vastly improved with its 60fps mode on PS5, but feels transformative at even higher refresh rates if you have the display to support it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311327"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A wide range of hardware is also supported in terms of resolution scaling features, with support for Nvidia's DLSS, AMD's FSR, and Intel XeSS super-sampling solutions. In addition, you can make use of Sucker Punch's own TAA solution with dynamic resolution scaling, which matches how the PlayStation handles the game, although it's a much less refined option than those offered by PC graphics cards. More surprising still is the decoupling of AMD's hardware agnostic frame generation solution, letting you pair it up with Nvidia's DLSS for the first time (officially) in a PC title. This means that you don't need a modern Nvidia 40-series card to enjoy the benefits of frame generation, which can nearly double your frame rate without much perceivable latency. There are some issues with image quality if you look hard enough, as the generated frames are injected between natively rendered ones, but they're minor enough that I played with the setting enabled for most of my time. This won't magically transform the game into a 60fps one if you are struggling to sustain that level of performance, however, as you'll have the best results with the game running there or higher already.</p><p dir="ltr">Between its scalable performance and robust range of settings, Ghost of Tsushima is another feather in the cap of Nixxes' work with PlayStation exclusives. Even if it's without some big improvements over its console counterpart, it's nonetheless a great way to experience one of the most visually striking open worlds on the market today despite its age, with the dangers and wonders of Tsushima island still a delight to experience for the first time.</p>

<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you find Slurp Cactus in<em> Fortnite, </em>they can help you gain shields and finish a weekly quest. Here’s where to spot them in this big battle royale open world. </p> <h2 id="h-slurp-cactus-in-fortnite-location" data-injectable="false">Slurp Cactus in Fortnite location</h2> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">The Slurp Cactus is a new interactive object in <em>Fortnite</em> that lets you gain shields after ramming it with a vehicle or hitting it with a weapon. They can be found all over the new desert area to the south of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5 Season 3</a> map. Find a car near a location like the Nitrodome and while driving, look on both sides of the road. You’ll see cacti that have blue gooey leaves on them. Ram into these plants and you’ll gain a shield boost. </p>

Once this is completed, you’ll net yourself 15,000 XP. It also accounts for the bonus goals, which ask you to complete a certain amount of Weekly Quests. If you finish 12, for example, there is a 25K experience bonus.</p>

Nitro Fists are a new weapon in the game that let you punch your foes to elimination. Get 400 damage with the Nitro Fists, and you’ll get yourself another 15K experience points. The best way to take them out is to uppercut them, then smash your fists down while you’re in the air. </p> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="false">Additionally, you can damage opponents with your car by either ramming them or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-mod-vehicle-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modding a weapon</a> to the top of your vehicle. You can collect them from boxes strewn throughout the map.

Amazon lists the release date as August 9, while Play Asia lists it for August 5. You will, however, get it sooner from Amazon if you live in the US, simply because you'll be importing from overseas at Play Asia. </p><p>The Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack includes over 200 tracks across nine discs. Each disc features gorgeous Zelda iconography and comes with a large, decorative storage case.</p><p>Note: Play Asia's price is $72 plus shipping and import fees, while Amazon's price is $136, at least for the time being. If you preorder from Amazon now, you won't be charged until your order ships in August. Plus, you will pay the lowest price offered between the time you order and release. It's <em>highly </em>unlikely this soundtrack will actually sell for $136 on Amazon. We'd expect it to drop significantly--close to Play Asia's price--before release. So you could secure your preorder now and cancel later if the launch price is too high.</p><p>That said, we wouldn't be surprised if this edition sells out, so you may want to secure your preorder and then cancel later if you think the launch price is too high.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Original Soundtrack Collector's Edition</a>       </h2>                                                                                                                         <div><p>Step up to the collector's edition and you'll get the same nine discs as the standard edition as well as a stylish Master Sword USB Player with 15 additional tracks. You'll also get a case with an exclusive design, giving you an easy way to store the volume when not in use.</p><p>Note: Amazon is currently charging $194 for the collector's edition version of the Tears of the Kingdom soundtrack (versus $120 plus import fees at Play Asia). Just like with the standard edition, it's unlikely you'll actually wind up spending $194. That said, we would expect this edition to sell out, so you may want to secure your preorder and then cancel your order closer to launch if you decide against getting it.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>While you're waiting for these to ship, consider checking out the existing collection of Zelda soundtracks. This includes music from Wind Waker, Majora's Mask, and Breath of the Wild. For good measure, we've also tossed in two great Mario soundtracks--one of which was released to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Most of these soundtracks have limited stock and prices fluctuate frequently.</p><h2>Best Nintendo Soundtrack Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B51QV1D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Breath of the Wild Soundtrack</a> -- $44</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Links-Awakening-Soundtrack/dp/B084Z9V1WW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Link's Awakening Soundtrack</a> -- $36</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-30Th-Anniversary-Concert/dp/B01N4D1161?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: 30th Anniversary Concert</a> -- $27</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-Regular/dp/B09G71ZN1T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Skyward Sword Soundtrack</a> -- $51</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Waker-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000BD768U?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Wind Waker Soundtrack</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Majoras-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0118AA54Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Majora's Mask Soundtrack</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P97PQ1M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Soundtrack</a> -- $47</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shuunen-Kinen-Super-Mario-Music/dp/B013JNSIE4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros Music: 30th Anniversary</a> -- $27</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-Original-Music/dp/B078HF56HQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20Get" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey Soundtrack</a> -- $34</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-audio-overview-sound-effects-for-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Via Francesco Paggiaro on Pexels</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction to game audio">Introduction to game audio</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio has the power to define the identity of a game and to drive its success. From realistic sound effects that build atmosphere to instantly recognizable themes and voiceovers that become synonymous with the title, game audio can enhance gameplay to create enchanting and memorable games that stand the test of time.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of game audio">The evolution of game audio</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Audio has come a long way since Alan Blumlein first invented what we now call “stereo” in the 1930s. As technology has advanced, so has the complexity of game audio design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early game audio was severely constrained by the technology of the day. Hardware such as oscillators and synthesizers churned out a variety of simple beeps and tones that nonetheless managed to resonate with players, and have stuck with them decades later.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mid-1980s brought MIDI technology, a standard protocol that enabled a new wave of more complex, dynamic and exciting melodies and sounds to be made. MIDI tracks could use different instruments and form harmonies, which added a new dimension to game music. It brought us another step closer to adaptive game audio, tailored to different game stages, actions or moods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 1990s brought us the CD-ROM and, with it, a new level of sound quality. Game audio became more realistic, cinematic and immersive. Audio cues were harnessed to guide players’ actions and dialogue became crystal clear. This was also the era in which plenty of licensed music made its way into games, with the soundtracks to titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Gran Turismo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all featuring songs by chart-topping artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 2000s saw 3D game audio and graphics really taking off. Technology such as surround sound and positional audio was paired with techniques such as modulation and mixing to create more visceral, responsive environments. These all amped up the excitement and the immersion of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3D environments are often now a given, so today’s game audio composers face the unique challenge of creating sound that responds to players’ actions in these spaces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is even more complicated for virtual reality (VR) games. The human brain registers sonic discrepancies when we move our heads, so game audio must be equally responsive, complementing head tracking when wearing a VR headset. Other factors audio designers working on VR games may now need to consider are whether to opt for diegetic or non-diegetic sound, how to balance player comfort with player performance and even how game audio can be used as a tool to reduce visually induced motion sickness (VIMS).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VR is an extremely exciting area for game audio industry players to explore. Game audio experts are being given the room to experiment with the tools and techniques they need to use to create seamless and immersive virtual environments. Innovative audio solutions will be necessary to keep pace with the ever-changing VR technology landscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond VR, there are equally as exciting opportunities arising in the audio gaming space. With no visual elements for context clues, audio games, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Papa Sangre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Nightjar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> immerse players in audio-only environments; listeners play a role in the world-building as they must use their imaginations to determine the origins of the sounds they are hearing, drawing them in in a particularly captivating and inclusive way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding the different types of game audio">Understanding the different types of game audio</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Background music">Background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music is the soundtrack to the game. This element of game audio has a particular influence on players’ emotions, which is integral to their immersion in and enjoyment of the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="SFX">SFX</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects (SFX) are all the sounds that objects make in a game (think ambient sounds, the two-note trill of Mario collecting a coin in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Bros</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the sounds you hear when you select an option on a menu and the pained cry of an opponent struck by a deadly blow). They provide an extra dimension to the game audio, enhancing the soundscape, providing instant feedback and reinforcing the actions onscreen.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Voiceovers">Voiceovers</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Voiceovers are character lines, announcements, dialogue, or narration. Game developers include character lines in their game audio to help us perceive characters’ moods, intentions, personalities and even cultural clues, enabling us to distinguish them from other characters. Narration and announcements can also help provide additional context, guiding players through the game and immersing them in the story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastering the art of background music in games">Mastering the art of background music in games</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Appropriate selection of background music">Appropriate selection of background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The best background music works in harmony with the visual, auditory and tactile elements of the game. It can heighten the emotion and the depth of the action onscreen, making it a crucial element of game audio. Its length, tempo, style and genre must seamlessly match that of each stage of the game to drive the narrative and fully take the player along with you on the game’s journey. Therefore, game developers need to consider what kind of music will best evoke the players’ emotions and their immersion in the game at every juncture. The main melodies should have just enough variations to surprise the player, keeping them engaged. For this reason, game audio composers tend to work with two to three themes. They can adapt each theme or motif to a certain level, stage, or character in the game, adding color and reflecting their unique characteristics while reducing player fatigue and maintaining the game’s overall sense of identity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The impact of background music on gameplay experience">The impact of background music on gameplay experience</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music adds depth and variety to the gaming experience. It works in synergy with other game audio elements and the game’s visual effects to create a multi-sensory impact, enriching the players’ interaction with the game world. It is a great tool for world-building: take, for example, “Dragonborn,” the iconic background music in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Its pulsing war drums, paired with epic strings, horns and deep vocals, really help build the world of icy tundra, ancient palaces and weapon-wielding dragon descendants, adding a sense of excitement. It can also help with storytelling, intensifying players’ intrigue and connection with the game’s characters: the background music in the adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Remains of Edith Finch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, gradually becomes richer as each character’s imagination evolves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, when done right, background music can take the game to new heights: game audio playlists and fan covers of prolific background music tracks have become more widespread in recent years, expanding the reach of their respective games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Integrating sound effects with game mechanics">Integrating sound effects with game mechanics</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Role of sound effects in video games">Role of sound effects in video games</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects are integral to video game design: they provide an auditory canvas for all other game audio elements, such as dialogue and music. Incorporating ambient sounds into game audio can help with world-building, and spot effects, such as footsteps or weapon loading, can provide important gameplay feedback, influencing the players’ strategies and actions. Overall, sound effects contribute to the sensory richness of the game, helping immerse players in the gameplay by amplifying the onscreen actions or events, bringing immediacy and presence to the environment and reinforcing the game’s narrative.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The science of associating sounds with actions">The science of associating sounds with actions</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relationship between sound and gesture has never been more pronounced: you push a button on your microwave and expect to hear some audio feedback. You fire up your streaming app, and you expect a welcome tone. If you hear a sound you’re not expecting to hear during that process, the brain registers that something has likely gone wrong, encouraging you to troubleshoot. You try the same process again or try a different strategy to see if you get different results. Some sound effects are so ingrained into our psyches that we no longer need a visual cue to identify what they are calling for us to do: take the Windows XP error sound effect, a call to action so prolific that 10 years after the product reached the end of its life, we can hear it in countless social media skits and know exactly what the creator is trying to tell us—and not a computer in sight. Harnessing this phenomenon, game audio professionals often link specific game actions with an audio cue, with repetition reinforcing it for the players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examples include sounds related to selecting different options in a menu, the swish of a karate kick, the often-descending sound motif of a player falling, perishing, or the dreaded game over. Action-associated sounds are a type of feedback—one of the most effective ways to guide players through the game. These game audio cues tell players what they should or shouldn’t do (in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, do eat the dots, don’t touch the ghosts, with different sounds presenting for each, for example) and how well they are progressing through the game. Over time, the players form these associations in their minds and can subconsciously use them to influence their next moves, focusing their attention and enhancing their gameplay.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring a variety of in-game notifications">Exploring a variety of in-game notifications</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Game notifications – from level completion to game over">Game notifications – from level completion to game over</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Music is known to drive mood. Our brains release happy chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin when we hear upbeat, joyful sounds and game audio experts can use this to reward players’ efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players often put in a great deal of effort to beat each level of a game. Anywhere else in life, you’d expect such effort to be rewarded. The failure to recognize an achievement in the game can render it a bit of a damp squib. To maintain player morale and motivate them to keep challenging themselves in the game all the way to the end, game audio professionals should build in at least some level of fanfare, ready and waiting to praise those who dare to fight their way through all the obstacles and make it to the next level. If the player has succeeded in completing a level—or, better still, completing the whole game—the trumpets of triumph can work hand in hand with onscreen graphics to lift players’ spirits, an aural pat on the back that strengthens their sense of achievement while wrapping up and drawing a line under that stage of the game. When players fail to complete a level, game audio experts should harness game over sounds to motivate players to regroup, take a breath and ultimately increase their desire or determination to try again.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio should be careful, considered and enthralling. Music, dialogue and sound effects are the very heartbeat of any game, driving its narrative and fully immersing players in its realm. The future of the game audio sector is bright, promising even more innovative soundscapes, new technologies, interactive sound effects and immersive techniques that will further enhance the gaming experience.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="186" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> got its first-ever patch today, addressing a myriad of issues and, finally, the misaligned peach fuzz on Senua’s face. Wait. Who notices that stuff?</p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Anyway, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hellblade 2</em> patch 1.0.5.0</a> is a small one, bringing around 20 fixes and changes to the game. Among the changes is one I feel is the most important for those who already finished the game. From now on, choosing the ‘New Story’ option in the menu will warn you that the feature will indeed reset your current progress. It didn’t say this before, no doubt prompting some to reassess using the option. I do wonder how many save files got wiped, though.</p>

Among the former and the New Story warning above, the patch also fixes memory leaks, ghosting issues, mission captions, and some artifacting when using FSR3. There is also one fix that kinda spoils an event near the end of the game, so I’d suggest you avoid reading the patch notes directly. </p> <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">I’ll post them below, sans spoilers (courtesy of Ninja Theory):</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-will-do-9-11-and-other-summer-game-fest-predictions.886851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-predictions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Somehow, even though Christmas was literally yesterday, Summer Game Fest – aka Keigh-3 – is almost upon us. Which B- and C-list celebrities will grace Geoff Keighley’s stage? Which triple-A games that won’t be out for another five years will debut their logos? Will Geoff finally acknowledge <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-layoffs-tweets-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851332390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(outside Twitter</a>) the layoffs that have plagued an alarming percentage of the companies whose floats populate his hype parade? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss all that and more.</p><p>On this week’s episode, Chris, Riley, and I huddle together after another week surviving the slow-mo media apocalypse, this time with (even) more AI. First we discuss Vox Media and The Atlantic’s mystifying decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feed their journalists’ work into OpenAI’s woodchipper</a>, shredding years of credibility and goodwill in exchange for a quick buck. Then we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s Neil Druckmann interview</a>, which the company ended up pulling after the<em> Last of Us</em> maestro revealed that he was egregiously misquoted. Maybe having people who are not journalists try to create journalism-coded content is… bad?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we make our predictions for this year’s Summer Game Fest. Is <em>Call of Duty</em> gonna <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneAlerts/status/1793746626349347319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do 9/11</a>? Absolutely. Is Hideo Kojima going to make some kind of appearance? Without a doubt. Is BioWare going to show actual footage of either<em> Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> or the next <em>Mass Effect</em>, rather than one of its trademark videos of art and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZJPvKbUgOA&amp;t=154s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some guys talking in the woods</a>? That is… less certain. Finally, we finish out by trying to decide who we’d replace Geoff with if we could pick somebody else to host every consequential video game event under the sun. Our picks may shock you (but probably not).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that one day we, the staff of Aftermath, can take over hosting duties at Summer Game Fest (and then immediately hand the reins back to Geoff because that job seems hard).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Alright, let’s officially transition into doing our predictions for Summer Game Fest, which is not Summer Games Fest, even though it should be called Summer Games – plural – Fest.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> It’s confusing! Why is there no S? I have to look this up every time, and it drives me bonkers. Put an S in there, for goodness’ sake.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Off the top, because I took down notes for this; I love to prepare for things. I love doing homework. Anyway, main prediction – this is in my notes – “It’s gonna be a giant letdown, like always.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was thinking about this, and all the things I always hope to see in an E3 – like oh, maybe there’ll be a <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Dishonored</em></a><em> </em>or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new<em> Deus Ex</em> </a>– we’re not getting either of those! And I had this moment of: what is there even to look forward to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I also think that Keighley tends to save all of his bombshells for The Game Awards. For Summer Game Fest, we just kind of get some stuff that’s coming this fall.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I can’t remember last year.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, you can’t remember last year because there was not really anything of note. It was all OK. That’s what it’s always like.&nbsp;</p><p>Will someone rush the stage? I doubt it. Keighley probably has fucking snipers up there now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What else? There’s a bunch of presentations.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah so, I went through them all and looked at the possibilities. My number one prediction: We’re definitely going to see the gameplay debut of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, and so notes here say, “Lights dim. Immediately shows a digitized re-creation of 9/11. No other details.”</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> There’s a part of me that feels like you can’t put 9/11 in a video game.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think they’re gonna do it!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Because the rumors say that<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> is gonna be about 9/11.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think it’s gonna be like [infamous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> mission] “No Russian.” It’s experiential. You’re not gonna be doing 9/11, though that would be hilarious. The most audacious thing possible.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> We don’t have swings like that anymore. Even at the height of that shit, you couldn’t have pulled that off.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think, at least in America, it has a kind of cultural weight even still that… I think you just can’t.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I agree. They’re gonna do something 9/11-ish. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. I also think people just don’t have that dog in ‘em anymore. There was a real time in 2006, 2007, 2008 – or even the early teens – where you could really pull off some shit. It was about “Is that OK? Did that <em>offend </em>you?” Especially [<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em>], that was really bad. The <em>Dark Knight</em> guy [David S. Goyer] wrote that, if I remember correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has that in them anymore. Even the last <em>Far Cry </em>game felt like they were just recycling the old <em>Far Cry </em>edgelord shit they used to be able to pull off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, <em>Far Cry</em> has not had the juice in three installments, at least.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Since<em> Far Cry 2</em>. But they can’t even get to<em> Far Cry 3</em> again. They have to do, like, weird Cuban exile shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s my prediction: Now, have I been playing through all of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 </em>on Mentor [difficulty] to unlock a mod? Yes. Will I try to beat the game on Master Ninja? Yes. Does that influence what I’m about to predict? Of course not. But what I’m saying is, they’ll probably try to announce some kind of weird <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>reboot or something. In part because there was an anniversary video a few months ago, but also because it seems like the kind of shit that would happen.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s sort of Team Ninja’s deal now. <em>Stranger of Paradise </em>was somebody coming to them and going “Can you make <em>Nioh</em>, but for us?” And they were like “Sure.” I don’t doubt that Xbox would be like “Can we spend money on a weird [<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> reboot]? Bring this back home.” Because that has Xbox DNA in it. So that’s just me wish-casting that, because I think it would be funny, and it would line up with things that I’m doing right now. But other than that, I really don’t care.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>What do we think the over-under is on Geoff finally mentioning layoffs on stage? Because he did it on Twitter earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think he will.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Zero percent. I wrote an article about this in our newsletter – about how many of the companies featured at Summer Game Fest had layoffs, which was, like, 40 percent. How is he gonna do it? Is he gonna be like “Massive layoffs at PlayStation, and now… PlayStation!”?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, what he’s gonna do is, he’s gonna do some annoying platitudes about how rough the industry is and how we’ve got to come together. “We are strong, we are gamers.” He’s gonna try to do gamer identity or games industry identity shit. He’s not going to in any way identify the cause of it, and by decoupling the cause from the results, he’s going to try to express empathy for the fact that everybody lost their jobs and get the cred for that while not spending any of the capital to insult the companies doing it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>He <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-opens-game-awards-with-disappointing-vag-1848190235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did that about the sexual assault stuff</a> a few years ago.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s the playbook for MeToo or Black Lives Matter. Every time there’s something that happens, how far can you push it before you make somebody powerful mad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Also, Geoff’s entire thing relies on powerful people. He has deals with a bunch of big companies. He’s friends with Kojima. That’s the whole appeal.</p><p>But also, yes, on one hand it would probably be in some way good for him to expend some social capital to talk about these issues more frankly. Gamers are often like “I just want to see my new product; I don’t care about the people who make it blah blah blah.” But on the other hand, it’s Geoff Keighley. After a certain point, it’s like asking Jake from State Farm to talk about Palestine. What do we really get from that? If you’re looking for meaningful, impactful work, I’m not sure if that’s the place to look.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right. That’s not going to make gamers suddenly give a shit about labor. And, you know, I want them to. That would be nice!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="00PXky"><strong>Legendary Shards</strong> are disappearing in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>. If you’re a veteran player, or have played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> for any significant amount of time, you probably have a pretty big stockpile of Shards that you need to get rid of before June 3, which is when the servers go down to prepare for the new expansion.</p>
<p id="BBut1q">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, I’ll help you figure out what to spend your Legendary Shards on before Bungie deletes them from your inventory.</p>
<hr id="2BLp3I">

<p id="68hK8t">If you’re like me, you have a lot of Legendary Shards to get rid of after seven years of hoarding. If you just wait until June 4, Bungie will delete them all for you, which is convenient. But if you want something more useful after all your time grinding, you can exchange them for a few different items in-game.</p>

<p id="c295Q3">Most players are taking their excess Legendary Shards and using them to purchase <strong>Phantasmal Fragments</strong> at the Lectern of Enchantment on the Moon for 10 Legendary Shards a piece. Rahool, the Cryptarch in the Tower, will allow you to exchange 10 Phantasmal Fragments for 10,000 Glimmer. While Bungie could take this exchange away, it’s better than nothing, and a solid way to turn your Legendary Shards into potential Glimmer.</p>
<p id="fHfMGC">If you’re a raider, another option is to buy<strong> Raid Banners</strong> from Hawthorn in the Tower. You can buy 10 Raid Banners for 30 Legendary Shards.</p>

<p id="MSOmkq">The best Legendary Shard exchange is, unfortunately, completely dependent on RNG. Rarely, Banshee-44 will sell a weapon with a <strong>Masterwork level of five</strong> (you have to buy each weapon to find its masterwork level). If you purchase a Masterwork five weapon over and over again, you’ll get an <strong>Enhancement Core</strong> out of each one that you dismantle. You can also do this if the Masterwork level is four, but the Enhancement Core won’t be guaranteed. </p>
<p id="KfRFOE">Enhancement Cores are very useful for upgrading gear, and getting them is a lot more difficult than restocking your Glimmer. Keep an eye on Banshee’s inventory over the weekend and see if you get lucky.</p>

<strong>What is replacing Legendary Shards in </strong><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong></em><strong>’s economy?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="QMyP4i">Legendary Shards have been the catch-all currency in <em>Destiny 2</em>, alongside <strong>Glimmer</strong>. With Shards going away, Glimmer is going to be the only general currency, and you’re just going to need to pair specialty currencies — like Ascendant Shards — with it to purchase the things you want. </p>
<p id="grYkOx">The catch there is that Glimmer has a cap of 500,000, so you can’t just stockpile it indefinitely like you could Legendary Shards. That’s why having Phantasmal Fragments or old Planetary Materials to exchange for Glimmer is so useful.</p>

What’s most surprising about <em>Selaco</em> isn’t that it’s developed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GZDoom</a></span>, but that it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played in years.<br></p><p><em>Selaco</em>, out now on Steam via early access, is a first-person shooter set inside the last surviving city containing all of human civilization. And unfortunately for the people living there, an alien invasion is happening and it’s up to you—a security guard—to help fight them back and save the day. Unlike <em>Doom </em>and similar shooters of that era, <em>Selaco </em>actually has quite a lot of lore and world-building to dig into via emails and terminals, if that’s something you care about. But if you’re just here to blast baddies with cool guns, <em>Selaco </em>has plenty of that, too.<br></p><h2 id="h50701"><a id=""></a><strong>This ain’t your grandaddy’s boomer shooter</strong></h2><p>The gunplay in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/selaco&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/selaco"><em>Selaco</em></a></span><em> </em>is fabulous, with weapons that are loud and powerful. Even the pistol, usually a trash firearm in old-school shooters, is a head-cracking magnum that you can upgrade into a fast-firing death machine. In fact, most of the guns in <em>Selaco </em>can be upgraded to improve their stats or unlock new features. This is done in upgradeable safe rooms you find dotted around the world…and yeah, you might be realizing this isn’t <em>Doom</em>.<br></p><p>That’s something I really want to stress. Don’t expect this to play like <em>Doom </em>or other contemporary shooters of the day. Instead, <em>Selaco</em> plays more like <em>Half-Life, Doom 3, </em>or <em>FEAR.</em> You’ll need to take cover, run away to get a better angle, ambush unsuspecting enemies for an advantage, and manage your ammo and health carefully to survive this FPS. If you go in with a shotgun and no plan, you’ll likely be dead in a few seconds. And as you progress through <em>Selaco </em>it turns up the challenge, forcing you to play carefully or die.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-recommend-id="image://2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a turret shooting an enemy in Selaco.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The big hook of <em>Selaco </em>for many will be the fact that, yes, it was developed using GZDoom—an open-source port of the original <em>Doom </em>engine that includes new features and tech not found in the ancient Id software game from the ‘90s. For the first few hours of <em>Selaco</em>, whenever I saw a massive level filled with individual items that I could pick up and toss around, I’d shake my head and think, “This is built on <em>Doom </em>tech. Wild!” But quickly, the novelty of that gimmick faded and was replaced by another thought: “This is a fucking awesome game.”</p><p><em>Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access!</p><p>In fact, I bet as you play <em>Selaco </em>you’ll quickly forget all about its <em>Doom </em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets. That may be the real secret of <em>Selaco</em>: While it’s cool and impressive that it was built using <em>Doom </em>tech, this<em> </em>is so much more than a retro throwback. It’s its own thing, and one of the best shooters in 2024. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two Interactive appears set to get out of the indie business, and it’s closing studios to get there. According to a damning new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Take-Two Interactive is working on a plan to either sell off or shut down it’s indie label Private Division.</p>



<p>Valentine states that Take-Two, despite saying that it “didn’t shutter” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intercept-games-lay-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s indie studios</a>, Kerbel Space Program developer Intercept Games will be closed on June 28. On a larger scale at Private Division, however, “almost all the staff” were let go at the end of April when it was said to them that Take-Two “would no longer support” the company.</p>



<p>The report adds that Take-Two has found a potential partner to buy Private Division in the form of an unknown private equity firm. </p>



<p>Valentine says that the sources she spoke to “expressed frustration at Take-Two leadership for alleged mismanagement of the label, and called out chief strategy officer and Private Division head Michael Worosz for poor leadership and mismanagement.”</p>



<p>On May 30, it was revealed that Private Division <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/private-division-terminates-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team-for-project-c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had terminated its agreement</a> with Bloober Team to publish Project C. With this new information being brought to light, it makes more sense as to why the agreement was canceled.</p>



<p>It was also in April when Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it was laying off</a> 5% of its global workforce, and canceling numerous games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story. For what it’s worth, the company declined to comment to IGN on the claims brought fourth and the status of Private Division.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-a-violent-nature-review-horror-movie-slasher-villain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dRrzH7"><em>This review of </em>In a Violent Nature <em>was initially published to coincide with the movie’s premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It has been updated for the film’s theatrical release.</em></p>
<h2 id="QtzSlx"><strong>Logline</strong></h2>
<p id="0HWcwP"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> follows Johnny, a hulking creature who has been dead for years, as he seeks vengeance on the most recent group of teens to bring him back to life. </p>
<h2 id="qQJ92i"><strong>Longerline</strong></h2>
<p id="b8GcFu">The way<em> In a Violent Nature</em> reveals its plot is a huge part of the fun of the movie, so no spoilers here. Instead, it’s worth talking a little bit about the vibe of the movie, which is mostly pastoral, rather than bombastic and quick. Writer-director Chris Nash seems to take inspiration from Michael Myers’ slow but deliberate stalking in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333343/best-halloween-movies-series-watch-michael-myers-john-carpenter">the Halloween movie series</a>. Long stretches of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> are still, quiet, gorgeous shots of nature — sometimes with a killer lumbering through them, sometimes not. </p>
<p id="BQQenY">This beautiful photography is a huge bonus to the movie, considering that most of the run time is devoted to Johnny walking from one place to another, in determined pursuit of his victims. Following a slasher-movie villain — part Jason Voorhees, part Michael Myers — mostly means watching him walking around, which seems perfectly intuitive when you see it on screen. <em>In a Violent Nature</em> makes these traveling scenes feel vibrant, purposeful, and intense, rather than like the drag they could have easily been.</p>
<p id="102m6V">Of course, this wouldn’t be a slasher if there wasn’t some slashing, and<em> In a Violent Nature</em> has plenty of that, too. The movie is full of gruesome kills, but Nash mixes the specifics up enough (from beheading to drowning to axe-throwing) that you never quite know what’s coming next, so the action never gets stale. </p>

<h2 id="PdCpiD"><strong>What’s In a Violent Nature trying to do?</strong></h2>
<p id="9bQGiy">It’s hard to describe this movie better than its press release does: It’s been labeled as an “ambient slasher.” It’s a slow, methodical movie, with sparse dialogue and not much character development. But that still doesn’t really describe what <em>In a Violent Nature</em> is going for. It feels more like a nature documentary approach to horror, with a slasher villain as a true animal kingdom predator, stalking through a beautiful forest and watching his prey from the foliage.</p>
<h2 id="5eDPYk"><strong>Does In a Violent Nature live up to its premise? </strong></h2>
<p id="otVa9M">Yes, but it might not be able to quite transcend that premise. <em>In a Violent Nature</em>’s endless forward locomotion and our slasher monster’s unflappable determination keep things interesting, and the tight 94-minute run time makes sure the story isn’t dull. But without the visceral release of tension in jump scares or surprise murder, the film feels like a constant build that never actually fully pays off. There’s no grand ending to cap off the story, which may be fitting for seeing the monster’s side of the story, but isn’t quite satisfying for an audience. Even so, the craft and uniqueness of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> make it well worth a watch.</p>
<h2 id="zX9jQI"><strong>The quote that says it all</strong></h2>
<p id="1HNraQ">This isn’t exactly a single quote, but watching Johnny lurk just outside the light of his teenage victims’ campfire while one of them tells his friends (and the audience) Johnny’s creepy origin story is an outstanding moment that casually reframes nearly every slasher ever made. We all know Jason had to be lurking just past the treeline during various scenes in the Friday the 13th franchise, but what exactly did he overhear while he was stalking his victims? </p>
<h2 id="DcLbG8"><strong>Most memeable moment</strong></h2>
<p id="lhbpmy">It’s hard to imagine finding a meme anywhere in a movie paced this slowly, but Johnny’s cold, dead, monstrous hands clasping around a necklace that says “#1 Motherfucker” is at least pretty funny.</p>
<h2 id="qxrgBT"><strong>Is In a Violent Nature good?</strong></h2>
<p id="oJXGkm"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is good, it’s just good in a different way than you might expect from its premise. It won’t exactly fill the trashy slasher hole in your heart, and it definitely isn’t for the “Friday night at the movies” crowd that most slashers are aimed at.</p>
<p id="bfdODm">But for horror fans, it’s a rare treat and a fantastic exercise in taking a genre in the opposite direction that everyone else has tried.<em> In a Violent Nature</em> may not spawn a franchise of Johnny resurrections, but there’s a good chance that every slasher that comes after it will take small bits of influence from the things<em> In a Violent Nature</em> does well. </p>
<h2 id="LpCOH8"><strong>When can we see it?</strong></h2>
<p id="66w5De"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is in theaters now, and will stream on Shudder later this year. </p>
