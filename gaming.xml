			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen 2.0 Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOqW5SRwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10<br>
● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>

Despite all this secrecy, one thing Marvel has finally lifted the curtain on in this second trailer is <em>Ozark </em>actor Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Garner’s version of the Silver Surfer is Shalla-Bal, who is known in the comics as the second Silver Surfer alongside her lover Norrin Radd, the male surfer most typically associated with the title. It’s unclear if Norrin will show up in <em>First Steps</em>, or if the Marvel Cinematic Universe is playing with the character’s backstory. Either way, the Silver Surfer is the “herald” of Galactus, who marks Earth for destruction before the big guy shows up to do his thing. We see her confronting the Fantastic Four, and her arrival sends the public into a frenzy. Everyone is looking to the heroes for answers and reassurance, and Mister Fantastic straight-up tells them that shit looks bleak. All of this is happening as the Fantastic Four is expecting a new addition, as Sue Storm is pregnant, and an incoming apocalypse is not an ideal situation to bring a baby into.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>All four members of the Fantastic Four are confirmed to star in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, as each actor was featured in Marvel’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474">obnoxiously long casting reveal last month</a></span>.

Amid all the new tricks and modes, Nintendo also confirmed a slew of new and returning tracks and racers for Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the course side, there were several new courses shown off as part of the roamable world. From the streets of Crown City to the water of Salty Salty Speedway, there are plenty of places to explore and shortcuts to discover. Mechanics like wall-riding and grinding seem like they'll add quite a bit for players to uncover. Here's what we spotted in today's Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Confirmed Courses Shown in Today's Direct</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li><li>Crown City</li><li>Salty Salty Speedway</li><li>Starview Peak</li><li>Boo Cinema</li><li>Toad's Factory</li><li>Peach Beach</li><li>Wario Shipyard</li><li>Whistletop Summit</li><li>DK Spaceport</li><li>Desert Hills</li><li>Shy Guy Bazaar</li><li>Wario Stadium</li><li>Airship Fortress</li><li>DK Pass</li><li>Sky-High Sundae</li><li>Koopa Troopa Beach</li><li>Faraway Oasis</li><li>Crown City</li><li>Peach Stadium</li><li>Dino Dino Jungle</li><li>Great ? Block Ruins</li><li>Rainbow Road</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's a world full of courses without a universe's worth of racers to speed across them? Mario Kart World looks to be making some deep pulls from Mario's history. The usual suspects of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi are joined by the likes of Spike, Conkdor, Penguin, and more. Here's everyone we spotted in a kart during today's Mario Kart World Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World Confirmed Racers From Today's Direct</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Peach</li><li>Daisy</li><li>Rosalina</li><li>Pauline</li><li>Yoshi</li><li>Toad</li><li>Koopa Troopa</li><li>Baby Mario</li><li>Baby Luigi</li><li>Baby Peach</li><li>Baby Daisy</li><li>Baby Rosalina</li><li>Wario</li><li>Waluigi</li><li>Bowser</li><li>Goomba</li><li>Spike</li><li>Cow</li><li>Lakitu</li><li>Toadette</li><li>Bowser Jr.</li><li>Birdo</li><li>King Boo</li><li>Shy Guy</li><li>Donkey Kong</li><li>Nabbit</li><li>Pirahna Plant</li><li>Hammer Bro</li><li>Monty Mole</li><li>Sidestepper</li><li>Cheep Cheep</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Wiggler</li><li>Cataquack</li><li>Pianta</li><li>Rocky Wrench</li><li>Conkdor</li><li>Chargin' Chuck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Stingby</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Dolphin</li><li>Para-Biddybud</li><li>Pokey</li><li>Coin Coffer</li><li>Peepa</li><li>Snowman</li><li>Fish Bone</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a line-up so far, and will probably only expand as we learn more about this game. Today's Mario Kart World Direct went over everything from Grand Prix and Knockout Mode to the camera-fueled social options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is set to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2's launch day, June 5, as an exclusive for the newest Switch console. There certainly seems to be quite a bit to do here, which will hopefully measure up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">to its $80 price tag</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo shared with us a Mario Kart World Direct and it revealed much more about the launch title for the Nintendo Switch, including new details on characters, courses, races, secrets, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This roundup has gathered everything you need to know about this Mario Kart World Direct and we hope it will help with the wait until this much-anticipated game launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Courses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World will feature a ton of new and old courses on its interconnected map, and we were introduced to a few of them today, including Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Salty Salty Speedway, Starview Peak, Boo Cinema, Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What should be most exciting for returning Mario Kart players is that the older courses have been "reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Characters and New Techniques</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering up to 24 racers can compete in one race, Mario Kart World will need a lot of characters to ensure everyone doesn't play the same one. While there are sure to be more added and revealed, this Direct featured such characters as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina, Rosalina, Koopa, Rocky Wrench, Conkdor, Goomba, Spike, Cow, King Boo, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Birdo, Bowser Jr., Lakitu, Toad, Wario, Pauline, Toadette, Shy Guy, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, Dry Bones, Wiggler, Cataquack, Pianta, Sidestepper, and Cheep Cheep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving with these characters will be even more fun this time around as there are new techniques to utilize. Charge Jump gives racers a chance to dodge enemy attacks, reach higher places and rails that can be grinded on, and even jump towards a wall to ride on it for a short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting new additions is Rewind, as it will let players try again to reach a hidden path or take a turn better or whatever! However, it is important to note that rivals will still move normally if you rewind so you could find yourself in even more trouble if you aren't careful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Races - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two main modes in Mario Kart World - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix will be the mode fans are used to as players will need to compete in multiple races to win the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Flower Cup, and more. However, this time around players will drive from course to course instead of exiting out to a menu, which should make for a much more seamless experience thanks to Mario Kart World's more open structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to conquer all of the Grand Prix Cups, a certain "colorful course" may appear which sure sounds like Rainbow Road. It won't be easy though, as there will be new obstacles like cars that shoot bullet bills and Hammer Bros. that throw their namesake hammers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a battle-royale-esque mode where you have to race from one side of Mario Kart World's map to the other. The only catch is you have to be in a certain place at each checkpoint or you will be knocked out of the race. The winner will be the last driver standing in the Golden Rally, Ice Rally, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Free Roam</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode, players will be able to drive wherever they'd like without the worry of trying to be in first place. As you explore, you will discover things like P Switches (hundreds of them!) that will activate blue coins you'll need to collect and start missions. These missions will be challenges that will improve your skills outside of races.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be hidden coins like Peach Medallions, hidden panels, and much more. Oh, and there is a photo mode in Free Roam that will be available to always capture that perfect moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visiting Yoshi's restaurant will also be a joy as you can pick up "Dash Food" that will give you a boost of speed and an outfit inspired by your meal! Some examples shown were a cheeseburger, sushi, skewers, chips, roasted meat, pizza, ice cream, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playing Mario Kart World with Friends</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Mario Kart World with friends will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to play this racing game, and Nintendo is giving players a ton of options in how they can do that. Such options include having four players play on one system, local wireless play with up to eight players (two systems of four), and up to 24 players from around the world playing in Online Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big feature in Mario Kart World is allowing players to free roam with their friends in between races. Players will be able to see where their friends are on the map and fast travel to them for some fun. You can then battle or race with custom rules or just explore the map with them. Photo Mode will also be available for friends!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameChat will also be an integral part of Mario Kart World as players will be able to talk to their friends and even see their reactions live on video for those who have a comptabile camera. If all players are on a single system, the camera can even detect up to four faces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Modes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the modes we mentioned above, players will be able to jump into Time Trials, where there will also be an option to go online and race against ghost data of others around the world. VS Mode is next and it offers a ton of customization, including the option to compete with up to four different teams of racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle Mode is back as well, and it includes such coompetitions as Coin Runners and Balloon Battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Items</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be familiar items returning to Mario Kart like Bullet Bill and Lightning, there will also be some new additions like the Coin Shell that can knock rivals off course and provide a trail of coins for players to collect. There will also be an Ice Flower to freeze enemies, Hammers to attack enemies and block their paths, a Mega Mushroom that will grow players to monstrous heights, a Feather that will let players jump to avoid attacks, and even a Kamek item that will call in the classic character to transform players into something mysterious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Support Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is aiming to be a game for players of all skill levels, and to reach that goal Nintendo is including some support features to help like Smart Steering, Tilt Controls (Joy-Con 2 wheel compatible!), Auto-Use Item, Auto-Accelerate, and the ability to adjust both the Vertical and Horizontal Camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview of Mario Kart World,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">how Nintendo is justifying its $80 price tag,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">our big Nintendo Switch 2 interview with Nintendo's Bill Trinen</a> to learn more about the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo let Ars Technica and other outlets have access to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">a small hands-on slice of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a> ahead of its planned June 5 launch. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U">a short livestreamed video presentation</a> gave a bit of extra information about how exactly the full version of the free-roaming Nintendo Switch 2 launch game will work in practice.</p>
<p>As the name implies, <em>Mario Kart World</em> sets itself apart from previous games via a "vast interconnected world" that you can roam freely between the actual race courses. That open space between races will feature "hundreds of P-switches," Nintendo said, each of which activates a small mission to "hone your driving abilities." Free-roaming racers will also be able to find hidden medallions and question-mark panels, as well as "drive-thru" food items that can be used to unlock new outfits.</p>

<p>While cruising around the Mario Kart "world," players will stumble onto new courses "inspired by their surrounding region," as well as "nostalgic courses for past titles... reimagined and spread throughout the world." When playing in Grand Prix mode, the drive between these courses will be integrated into the usual four-course cups themselves; after racing Mario Kart Circuit in the Mushroom cup, for instance, the second race&nbsp;"will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City," Nintendo said.</p>
<p>The game's other main race mode, Knockout Tour, slowly whittles 24 racers down to just four via checkpoints spaced throughout the course. These "extended rallies" will take racers across the game world, with one track seamlessly flowing into another on a preset path.</p>

<p>Players who prefer a more traditional three-lap race on a single course can do so via the game's VS Mode races. The traditional battle mode will also return, with a Balloon Battle mode focused on hitting other players with weapons and a Coin Runners mode focused on getting more money than your opponents.</p>

<p>For Sigman and the Darkest Dungeon team, it was important to establish an overarching design philosophy that was set in place. That said, the details within that framework may change or evolve significantly during development.</p>
<p>“In this age of early access and easily updatable games, balance is a living thing,” Sigman said. “It’s highly iterative throughout the game’s public life. We will update balance based upon community feedback, analytics, evolving metas, and also reflections on our own design philosophies and approaches.”</p>

      </figure>

<p>The problem, of course, is that every change to an existing game is a double-edged sword. With each update, you risk breaking the very elements you’re trying to fix.</p>
<p>Speaking to that ongoing balancing act, Sigman admits, “It’s not without its challenges. We’ve found that many players eagerly await such updates, but a subset gets really angry when developers change balance elements.”</p>
<p>Getting one of your favorite heroes or abilities nerfed can absolutely sink a game or destroy a strategy you’ve relied on for success. The team relies on a number of strictly mathematical tools to help isolate and solve balance problems, but on some level, it’s an artistic and philosophical question.</p>
<p>“A good example is how to address ‘exploits’ in a game,” Sigman said. “Some games try to hurriedly stamp out all possible exploits. With a single-player game, I think you have more leeway to let some exploits stand. It’s nice to let players get away with some stuff. If you kick sand over every exploit that appears, you remove some of the fun.”</p>
<p>As with so many aspects of game design, perfecting the balance between adversity and empowerment comes down to a simple question.</p>
<p>“One amazing piece of wisdom from Sid Meier, my personal favorite designer, is to remember to ask yourself, ‘Who is having the fun here? The designer or the player?’ It should be the player,” Sigman told us.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of approach that players love to hear. Even if a decision is made to make a game more difficult, particularly in an existing game, it should be done to make the play experience more enjoyable. If it begins to feel like devs are making balance changes just to scale down players’ power, it can begin to feel like you’re being punished for having fun.</p>
<p>The fine balance between power and challenge is a hard one to strike, but what players ultimately want is to have a good time. Sometimes that means feeling like a world-destroying demigod, and sometimes it means squeaking through a bloody boss encounter with a single hit point. Most often, though, you're looking for a happy medium: a worthy challenge overcome through power and skill.</p>

The aforementioned harvesting mechanic at the heart of the enemy AI systems allows for multiple evolutions. Enemies don't just get stronger, they can also learn new attack patterns and mutate into new character models. The pair showed off how basic enemies have two tiers of evolution, meaning players who can't knock down every enemy will face an entirely new kind of monster that could turn the tide in a fight.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that gunplay and traversal in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn't just an updated version of what Bloober made in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Player movement and shooting is meant to mimic what is often referred to as the "tank controls" of survival horror games from the late '90s and early 2000s. These games limited player movement, slowed down aiming, and used restrictive camera angles to make it harder to spot enemies at a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though novel for their time, advancements in video game combat as a whole make "tank controls" a less appealing experience for most modern players. To recreate that sensation without relying on decades-old restrictions, Bloober made two key design decisions. The more subtle one was to mandate that guns not fire with a simple trigger press. They need to be charged up, giving enemies time to close the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The more surprising choice—one that greatly diverges from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—was to not give players a "dodge" button. Players instead are given a resource-dependent flamethrower burst that can push enemies away or eliminate dead bodies used for power-ups. The resource-juggling is familiar to survival horror, but denying players a dodge button goes against recent trends. None of this, the pair said, could be done without Bloober increasing headcount and seeking out developers with specific skills.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-vicious-cycle-translator-unions-call-out-keywords-for-lowballing-contract-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A vicious cycle:' Translator unions call out Keywords for lowballing contract workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We bolster a team [with] specific people," said Zieba, noting that Bloober hired a dedicated "gunsmith" whose sole job would be making the charge-heavy guns.

"It's easier to get better specialists who love survival horror like us," he said. Zieba said the studio at large still operates in a "hybrid" mode.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features more than 100 notes to collect and read, and it's worth searching for each one. Compulsion Games knocked it out of the park regarding storytelling in South of Midnight, and these notes are no exception.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll notice more notes to grab in this chapter than in any previous chapter. So if you were going to try and find them yourself, it's best to be vigilant about searching an area before you move on.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you want to make sure you don't miss any of the 15 notes in Chapter 7. Here's where to grab each one.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 had 11 notes to find, Chapter 6 had 10, and now Chapter 7 has 15. And that's not even the most you'll see in a single chapter. But that's still to come.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Lost Boy</strong> - At the start of the chapter, follow the path until you hear Hazel point out the old sawmill, which will happen just before you're about to jump across a river. Jump across, and turn left to find a climbing path that leads you up and around the rock wall to an area blocked by the bramble and vines. You'll find the note on a box next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lost Liquor</strong> - You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the chapter. Once you've cleared it, look to the right and you'll likely be able to spy a health filament behind some branches. You'll find the note resting on some boxes just ahead of the branches, and since you're there, you might as well grab the filament.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lieutenant Laurent</strong> - When you reach the memory object showing a clip of Hazel's mother, look to your right. You'll find the note on an old dresser at the entrance to a path with a box and a Floof knot to jump to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Babblin' Boy</strong> - After finding the last note and crossing the river, turn left to find a path blocked by some branches you can push out of the way. Behind them, you'll find the note on a box next to a metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Baby Faced Laurent</strong> - From the last note, follow the path, and you'll have to cross the river again, using echoes of a bridge to do so. Once you've passed the echo bridge, turn left, and you'll find this note on a box next to another metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lil' Drunkards</strong> - After finding the last note, follow the path and jump over two big bramble vines. You'll see this note in a hollow dead tree that should be directly in front of you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>End of Prohibition -&nbsp;</strong>After clearing the combat encounter that ends with you using Crouton to clear the Stigma, you'll head under a large tree as you follow the path to leave. This note is to the right of the path, underneath the tree.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Boy out of Time</strong> - You'll find this note almost immediately after you find the last one. Once you walk beyond the tree, you'll see a building to your right. The note is resting on a structure just on the porch of the building.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Heart of Lace</strong> - After the cutscene with Laurent at the Juke Joint, head back into the shop and go up the stairs. You'll find this note on a box next to Laurent and Lacey's picture.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> - Once you reach Milltown after using the grapple, head straight down the path, and you'll find this note inside the house on the right, on a table next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Mother's Last Words</strong> - Inside the same house you find the last note in, this note is on a bedframe at the back of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Everything Helps</strong> - When you enter Milltown, you'll be able to see a broken-down well to your left. Turn left past the well, and then look to your right to see a building that's missing a wall. Walk into the building to find this note on a box on your right, just ahead of a combat encounter.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Father's Job</strong> - After clearing the combat arena just beyond the last note you found, and watching the first of Laurent's memories, this one will be waiting for you in a building to the right of a big crane, next to two giant saws crossed over each other and making an 'X'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Penny Saved</strong> - You'll find this one on the second floor of the sawmill, which you reach after finding all four of Laurent's memories. When you make it to the second floor, you'll use your grapple to cross a big gap around the outside of he mill. Once you're back inside, look to your left to see some wood you can push out of the way. Push that, then another bundle of wood, and you'll see this note resting on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Maintaining Productivity</strong> - This last note can be found in the office, just beyond where you found the previous note. You'll also find a Floof knot in this office, right next to the note on a desk.</p>
<p>And that's where you can find all 15 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 7. If you've followed these guides so far, you'll have found 53 out of the 103. Only 50 more to go.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">While Mario Kart is known for high-speed races across over-the-top courses, head-to-head racing hasn't been the only way players could compete with one another in these games. Today, during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> Direct livestream, Nintendo confirmed that Battle Mode--where kart racers try to pop balloons or collect as many coins as possible--will make its return in Mario Kart World when it launches June 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mario Kart World Direct showed two returning contests that will be included in Battle Mode this round: Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. Balloon Battle is the classic Mario Kart battle format, where each racer must pop their competitors' balloons by hitting them with items, while Coin Runners sees racers compete to collect the most coins within a certain time limit.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1966472598" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>Nintendo streamed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/">Mario Kart World Direct</a> this morning, which included a more detailed look at gameplay in Mario Kart World, and some of the new features players can expect.</p>
<p>The presentation was only 15 minutes long, and was a back-to-back dive into different aspects of Mario Kart World, like some of the new courses, characters, tricks, items and game modes for players in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>We know plenty of the big news about Mario Kart World, like the fact that the new open-world setting means we can drive anywhere and spend time freely roaming around the world and the tracks. The direct also showed for the first time that there are plenty of challenges and hidden items to find while doing so, like blue-coin P challenges to discover, hidden coins and hidden panels.</p>
<p>You can also use photo mode whenever you want while in free roam, and if you're playing with friends online, or even locally, you don't necessarily jump into a race or Grand Prix to play together. You can instead just drive around the world, enjoy the views, and create your own fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased eight of the courses we'll all be racing on, with some returning tracks players will recognize and some brand new. Rest assured there is more than what was shown, but the ones we got to look at were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario Shipyard</li>
</ul>
<p>We also got a not-so-slight-hint that to unlock Mario Kart World's version of the infamous Rainbow Road, you'll have to complete and win each of the Grand Prix's in the game. Regarding the characters you can race as, we once again didn't get a look at the full roster, but we did get a closer look at four of the new racers, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Cow</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Lakitu</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of new items, six items were highlighted in the direct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Feather</li>
<li>Ice Flower</li>
<li>Coin Shell</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the six shown, being able to use Kamek's magic looks like it will be the most interesting one, and the one with the potential to really shake things up in the race, as you transform your competing racers into various things. The rest seem like your bog-standard hazards and boosts, though when combined with the increased number of road hazards that'll just appear in each track, which we also got a look at, these races are shaping up to be some of the most hectic in the entire series.</p>
<p>Nintendo also confirmed that the racing wheel for the Joy-Con controllers is back with the Joy-Con 2 Wheel, purpose-built for the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, and racers new to the series will have similar features included in Mario Kart 8, like smart steering at their disposal, should they need it.</p>
<p>The last two new features shown in the direct that seem to bring a good deal of change to the game were two new tricks, Rewind and Charge Jump. The latter is kind of like an ollie on a skateboard, where you'll just jump straight up to help you avoid obstacles, but also jump onto grind rails to reach new areas, and find new paths on each track.</p>
<p>Rewind does exactly what it sounds like it does, and rewinds what you've just done in-game so you can try again. But you're not rewinding the entire race when you use it, you're only rewinding the actions you've taken. Which means if you rewind while in 1st place because you want to try grinding a rail again, you can put yourself in 2nd just to try and get that sick clip.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a solid showcase of what's to come in Mario Kart World, but whether it did as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Doug Bowser</a> hoped it would, and convince players that Mario Kart World is worth its $80 price tag, is to be determined.</p>
<p>If you want to check out more about Mario Kart World, you can read what we thought when we went <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the game at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 event</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new force for Cygnar, the Gravediggers, with their first releases, the Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>From The Skies!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction for Warmachine, and can trace their history back to the early days of Warmachine in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original Warmachine and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>

<p>There's a roadmap of releases planned for them, but they begin with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which features a perfect 30-point army to jump straight into games with them, and follows those starter forces from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Scum</a> and provides players with one of each unit type. Releasing alongside the Command Starter is the Gravediggers Battlegroup Box, which features a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks to expand your Command Starter, or start playing at lower model count games. Both of these sets feature crates and items that make use of their Airdrop rules, and we'll go into details of both sets and their rules below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=1CYBU9rU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=eeKNW4CU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Command Starter Set.</figcaption></figure><h2>Watch Out For Buck</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Starter Set is a great introduction to how the Gravediggers like to play, which is sneaky and devastating. This box is led by&nbsp;Captain Buck Hasker, who has Prowl, which gives him stealth if he has concealment, protecting him from attacks more than 5 inches away. He also passes this on to his Warjack, which means that every unit in this box has Prowl. Buck likes to leap from concealment and chain attacks with Killing Spree, which lets him make an additional attack if he removes an enemy model in melee. His close combat weapon, Fang, which stops the use of Tough, makes doing that a lot easier. His feat allows him to place 3 mine tokens within his control range, which deal damage and knock down any enemies coming within 3 inches of them. This is great for protecting him while he gets some wet work done, effectively locking him into an area with his target.</p>

<p>Buck's Warjack, Plugger, is an absolute beast of a heavy Warjack. Operating like Buck, moving to engage its target, and if destroyed, making a full advance back into hiding. Plugger comes with Stealth (not Prowl), which means he doesn't have to be in concealment to gain the benefits of Stealth. Plugger comes armed with dual trench rippers and a metal storm cannon to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=xeITb1tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=mQxQWgIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buck's Gravediggers prepare for action.</figcaption></figure><p>Buck and Plugger are backed up by Sergeant Brunaugh "Bruno" Ramjaw and the Rowdies, who all have Prowl and Advanced Deployment, to get them closer to the action and harder to target. Ramjaw uses a backpack-fed minigun to knock infantry troops back. The Rowdies give each other overlapping buffs while they're still on the field. Killing Spree, Reposition, and Precision Fire are all granted to each other, and they all come with Smoke Bombs as standard to make them difficult to target, which is helpful as they're all fairly short ranged.</p>

The Medical Crate allows nearby friendly units to deal one damage to the crate, to either remove a damage from a model with Tough that is disabled nearby, or remove D3+2 damage from a living model, or return a Grunt to a unit.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box works a little differently to the Command Starter in that it includes a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks, and doesn't make a clean 30-point force. It can create a 30-point force, but the Warjacks have a variety of weapon options, so you'll have to do some planning before you build them. The set is great if you want to play a 30-point game with a smaller number of units, or perfect if you want to expand beyond the Command Starter.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box includes&nbsp;Captain Cynthia 'Cyn' Rosko, who is the daughter of the famous&nbsp;Allister Caine we covered in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>. Rosko has inherited her father's affinity to magic and comes armed with the Witch Hammer rocket launcher, which allows her to ignore cloud effects and stealth to strike her target if she aims. Her feat grants all models in her battleground and control range to make an additional ranged or melee attack that turn, which can mean an absolutely insane gunline attack for 1 turn.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=nOAnYbm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=VwTkrKuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko can set up an insane gunline with her feat.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of the Warjacks in this set, the Valient (Heavy Warjack) and the Patriot (Light Warjack), come with build options for their heads and weapons. The head options give different abilities, which for the Valiant, means choosing between being faster and able to charge without spending a focus point, moving after being hit with an attack, a free move if it didn't run during the turn, and free move and attack if a friendly unit is taken out nearby. The Patriot also has 4 weapon options for each arm, which vary in point costs and types. Personally I'm a fan of the Volley Gun/Shield and Heavy Mortar loadout to rain down fire on anyone threatening the rest of the Gravediggers as they close the distance on their enemies.</p>

<p>The Patriot also has 4 head options, an arc node that allows casters to channel through it, the ability to move after taking out an enemy, a&nbsp;free move if it didn't run during the turn, or can bodyguard a nearby friendly unit. As with the Valiant, the Patriot comes with 4 weapon options for each arm, and how you want to use your Warjacks will determine how you arm them, including getting the best use of the rest of your force's buffs and your Warcaster's feat. Personally I'm a fan of the Sniper Cannon and Blaster/Shield combo to lay down fire at rage and boost your Warjack's armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=XWnFyP9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=NDRu67Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko loves to set up a gunline, and the heavy weapons crate just reinforces it.</figcaption></figure><p>Also in the Gravediggers Battle Box is a heavy weapons crate which works with the Heavy Airdrop Command Card. This card allows you to drop a Blocker or a Skirmisher Warjack onto the battlefield, or a Heavy Weapons Crate, which the Valiant Warjack can interact with to gain a Heavy Flamethrower, Howitzer, or Rocket Pod. It also gains +1 armor for the rest of the game, and a bonus focus point for the turn it interacts with the crate. This adaptability is one of the Gravedigger's greatest strengths, and your opponent will never be sure if you're about to get another Warjack, or your Valient is about to gain an extra weapon and go to town on their forces.</p>



<p>I'm so glad that the release of the Gravediggers coincided with me getting back into <em>Warmachine,</em> as they feel like a faction perfectly suited to my style of play. I love that they're a hard as nails combat force, but they're also super sneaky and insanely adaptable to the changing battlefield. These 2 boxes offer a dual style of entry. The clean Command Starter, with its fixed armaments and full roster of unit types, or the smaller Battle Box that still shows what the Gravediggers are all about, and has customization options for the Warjacks' loadouts. Their paratrooper/special forces feel sits well with me, and their theme is captured extremely well in their mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with previous <em>Warmachine</em> releases, these set are just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with the Gravediggers is easy.</p>

The publisher held a <em>Mario Kart World</em> direct presentation on April 17th debuting 15 minutes of gameplay which showcased many of the game’s new features.</p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> will feature a bunch of new courses to race through. There’s Mario Bros Circuit, the desert roadtrip-looking course Nintendo’s shown off in every <em>Mario Kart World</em> video; an urban course called Crown City; Salty Salty Speedway, which is one of <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s water levels; and many more including returning classics like Peach Beach and Wario Shipyard. Nintendo also hinted that once you complete all the Grand Prix cups a “certain colorful course” will appear which can’t be anything other than the iconic Rainbow Road.</p><p>There are lots of new items, features, and settings to make the most out of your race to the finish. The new feather item lets you jump to avoid attacks. The new rewind feature lets you rewind time so you can hit that missed trick or jump to find secret areas. Speaking of secret areas, in the game’s free roam mode you can find all kinds of hidden secrets like P-switches and panels that unlock overworld missions to complete. Nintendo’s gone all out to make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the standout game for the Switch 2 — now if only the US could pre-order the dang thing.</p><p>You can watch the full event below:</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">initial excitement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2</a> has cooled. Consumers have been left reeling from the price of the console, announced at $450, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">which has the potential to balloon in the United States</a> due to the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">ruinous tariff policy</a>. (Trump has decreed a 90-day pause on the tariffs which ostensibly gives Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">more time to ship to the US as many units as it can</a>.)</p></div><p>The games too will be more expensive, with some titles, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>, blowing past the $70 price point <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">to retail at $80</a>. That is, if you can even get the console to play it. US consumers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">cannot yet pre-order the Switch 2</a> (once again, thanks to the tariffs) which has also impeded Canada from pre-orders as well. Nintendo has not yet signaled when it’ll open up pre-orders for the two countries but said that the console will still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">go on sale there June 5th</a>. <em>Mario Kart World</em> will be launching alongside the new console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Harken to the tolling of the village bell! See the blazing of the watchfires on the parapet! CD Projekt have issued a warning about Witcher 4 beta scams. Apparently, people have been receiving invites to playtest the new Witcher, even though CD Projekt have previously said that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't release before 2027</a>. If you sign up to anything right now, the only thing you'll be beta-testing is how fast you can change all your usernames and passwords.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - this is a scam!" shrieks a <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">social media post</a>, like a cleric at the chapel door ushering the peasants inside. "We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."</p>
<p>"Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams," the post adds, just in case that immersion-breaking mention of email clients had sabotaged your day with the knowledge that you are not, in fact, a greying leathery Lothario with a silver sword. "They see right through them and slay them!"</p>
<p>Not to rap you on the nose with a rolled-up lore bible, CD Projekt, but I think that characterisation does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-explain-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer-geralt-could-have-said-this-about-ciri-as-well">The Witcher's emotive branching storytelling</a> a disservice. If this were a quest from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Geralt would probably trace the scammers to their lair and discover that they are actually small orphan children who were cruelly disfigured and cast out by the villagers on account of having hairy toes, or something. He would have to decide between butchering them or butchering the villagers or blowing up Megaton. Then he would partake in some sex with a witch (I 'ardly knew 'er, etc) and play a rousing round of Triple Triad. I confess, my memories of The Witcher 3 are a little rusty.</p>
<p>"Should we ever organize any beta tests in the future, you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites," CD Projekt conclude. While you wait, you can re-read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) frenzied demands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-needs-a-double-jumping-horse-like-elden-ring-or-im-out">for a double-jumping horse</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it’s been steeped in some controversy along the way, the kart racer looks like a pretty substantial leap forward after a decade of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Nintendo held a dedicated Direct showcase for the game this morning, and if you want to watch the 15-minute presentation you can do so below. For everyone who just wants some of the highlights, here are some of the new things we learned during showcase.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-recommend-id="image://9ac23204d864a277c8556cda7789b148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mario Kart World map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Direct started with a showcase of different courses, including new tracks and reimaginings of old ones. Some of the courses Nintendo spotlighted were the metropolis Crown City, the Venice-esque Salty Salty Speedway, the icy trails of Starview Peak, and a drive-in theater called Boo Cinema. Some of the old tracks from previous games that will be reimagined for World include Toad’s Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-recommend-id="image://1e2026f5205eb7caec33c1e4aa39edcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Knockout Tour course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two main racing modes in <em>Mario Kart World </em>are the classic Grand Prix seen in previous games that takes you and 23 other players through multiple courses to see who comes out on top, and a new mode called Knockout Tour. These are lengthy, multi-track races that gradually pick off players as they go on. Racers will drive through different checkpoints that will gradually eliminate players in the lower positions. It’s kind of like <em>Mario Kart</em> battle royale.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-recommend-id="image://0e0b26201d9e793fdb28115da47770b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rosalina throws an Ice Flower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo showed off new usable items that will help give you an edge in a race. Some new ones include: The Coin shell that puts coins on the track for you (or your enemies) to grab, the Ice Flower that freezes your enemies, Hammers, thrown in a classic Hammer Bros. arc, to smash and block your opponents where they land, Mega Mushrooms that make you big enough to run over your enemies, Feathers that give you more air time and let you find alternate routes, and Kamek, which seems like a bit of a wild card item that can have different effects.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-recommend-id="image://f1247465c63c2fdfe13b67c63d8dfba7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The accessibility menu in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo announced a few features and playstyles that will help the game be more accessible.

Throughout the open world, you’ll find different meals that will unlock new threads based on the food you take to go. For example, if you eat sushi, you’ll unlock traditional Japanese clothing.

You can jump to avoid incoming obstacles, drive on walls, and rewind to get a second shot at jumping to an alternate route.

Time Trials are returning, and will include ghost data from other players for you to compete against as you try to get a new personal best time. VS Race lets you customize a race’s ruleset, and supports up to four teams so several players can group up together for a collective score. Battle modes Coin Runners and Balloon Battle are also returning, letting you duke it out with other racers. Free Roam is exactly what it sounds like, and lets you drive around the game’s open world to explore, solve puzzles, and find collectibles. While you race and explore the world, you’ll be able to use a photo mode to take cool screenshots of all your sick tricks and neat discoveries.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-recommend-id="image://01eee28fef54254827a5980cdd882d3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Mario Kart World players pose for a photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of the appeal of Free Roam is getting to zone out and ride around without the pressures of racing, and you can play it with friends and drive around the open world together. Using the Switch 2's chat button will allow you to voice chat as you ride around, and you can take photos together with the photo mode. And whether you’re Free Roaming with friends or alone, it seems the world is packed with things to discover, including P Switches that start challenges, as well as special hidden coins, panels to activate (for some as of yet unknown purpose), and more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Your choice of leader, though, sticks with you throughout the entire game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they don’t provide as many traits and units as Civilizations, Leaders still have powerful abilities that can create some excellent combinations when mixed and matched. To help you out, we’ve created this tier list of every Leader and highlighted their strengths and weaknesses. This should help you choose who you want to be the face of your empire as you build your future all the way into the Modern Age. </p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civilization 7 Leader Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-Tier</strong> - Confucius, Xerxes King of Kings, Ashoka World Conquerer, Augustus</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-Tier</strong> - Ashoka World Renouncer, Benjamin Franklin, Charlemagne, Harriet Tubman, Hatshepsut, Himiko High Shaman, Isabella, Jose Rizal, Machiavelli, Trung Trac, Xerxes The Achaemenid</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B-Tier</strong> - Amina, Catherine The Great, Friedrich Oblique, Ibn Battuta, Lafayette, Napoleon Emperor, Napoleon Revolution, Tecumseh, Himiko Queen of Wa </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C-Tier</strong> - Friedrich Baroque, Pachacuti</p><h2 data-cy="title2">S-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-s-tier-1744891859075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Ashoka, World Conquerer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Production for every 5 excess Happiness in Cities.</li><li>+10% Production in Settlements not founded by you.</li><li>Declaring a Formal War grants a Celebration. +5 Combat Strength against Districts for all Units during a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashoka, World Conquerer is all about keeping your own citizens happy while terrorizing other civilizations. Happiness is a very strong yield, and as long as you can keep a strong flow of excess Happiness, you will get continual benefits. Settlements not founded by you and excess Happiness result in extra Production meaning you can make a lot of Units and maintain a strong base to fuel your war efforts. Also, declaring a Formal War grants you an automatic Celebration. This gives you an instant +5 Combat Strength against Districts and All Units. This makes you excellent at putting your enemy on the back foot immediately once a war is declared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all the excess Happiness, you can likely get one or two extra Celebrations during a war, so you go through periods of extreme military power. The only thing to manage is, as you take over Settlements from your fellow civs, dealing with the unrest they bring. However, if you can manage that and keep everyone happy, Ashoka, World Conquerer is one of the strongest leaders in the game. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Augustus</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Production in the Capital for every Town. Can purchase Culture Buildings in Towns.</li><li>+50% Gold towards purchasing Buildings in Towns.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Augustus gets a lot of benefits from a relatively straightforward style of play. He is all about going wide with his Settlements and establishing as many Towns as possible, be that through settling or conquest. Interestingly though, his value comes in not upgrading Towns to City. That saves him Gold, but he gets a nice bonus to Gold and Production for maintaining as many Towns as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He can turn his Capital into a powerhouse, with all of his towns feeding his central base. On top of he can buy buildings cheaper in Towns, and has access to buying Culture buildings. This can really add up, both giving him immense amounts of Production and Culture, but also saving him money along the way. It’s a nicely rounded style of play with great benefits and an easy-to-understand goal. Just get out there and settle lots of Towns - or take them by force.   </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Confucius </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+25% Growth Rate in Cities.</li><li>+2 Science from Specialists.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Confucius is a master when it comes to expanding his Cities. The natural +25% Growth Rate in Cities is just powerful, especially early on when land-grabbing is important. You can expand your borders much faster than your opponents, absorbing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Best_Resources">key Resources</a> before they can. And you can do it without the pain of going to war. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also has ease becoming one of the best producers of Science in the game thanks to getting +2 Science from Specialists. This can make him particularly potent, especially in the end game where his Specilasits stack up, and he has access to much more advanced Technology than other civilizations. He may need a little help defending his lands, so a strong Civilization pairing, or making a powerful ally can go far. Outside of that though, there’s not a lot that’s going to stop Confucius from gobbling up all the land he can, all while being one of the most technologically advanced. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Xerxes, King of Kings</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+3 Combat Strength for Units that are attacking in neutral or enemy territory.</li><li>Gain 100 Culture and Gold per Age upon capturing a Settlement for the first time. +10% Gold in all Settlements, increased even further in Settlements not founded by you.</li><li>+1 Settlement limit per Age.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Xerxes, King of Kings is as straightforward as it gets. He has one specialty - attacking other players and taking their Settlements. It’s not complicated or highbrowed, but it is undoubtedly effective, especially if you are looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Civ_7_Military_Victory_Guide_and_Best_Leaders">Military Victory</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He benefits from being the aggressor in every situation, getting free combat strength, that doesn’t require anything to activate past initiating fights in foreign territory. He’s also incentivized to take over as many Settlements as his limits will allow, though he even gets a higher Settlement limit. For doing so, not only is he advancing the Military Legacy Path, he gains Culture and Gold further fueling his military aims. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-a-tier-1744891883065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Ashoka, World Renouncer</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Food in Cities for every 5 excess Happiness.</li><li>+10% Food in all Settlements during Celebration.</li><li>All buildings gain a +1 Happiness adjacency for all Improvements.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as militarily spooky as the World Conquerer version of Ashoka, the World Renouncer is certainly nothing to sniff at. While the other version is about turning Happiness into military might, this version of Ashoka is all about turning Happiness into population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This changes the play from trying to take over as many Settlements with your units, into going for a land grab and establishing Districts. This can be excellent in the right hands, especially those who know how to manage big populations and city construction. You can also bypass the unrest of taking over Settlements, so there is an argument the World Renouncer is as strong or even stronger. That said, it requires a little more finesse and doesn’t receive the powerful production bonuses. Either way though, as long as your population is happy, your borders should be expanding if you choose to go the World Renouncer route.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Benjamin Franklin</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Science per Age on Production Buildings in CIties.</li><li>+50% Production towards constructing Production Buildings.</li><li>+1 Science per Age active Endeavors you started or supported.</li><li>Can have two Endeavors of the same type active at a time.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Benjamin Franklin is an exceptional and versatile Leader if you intend to go down the Science route in your game. What’s nice is his specialties are in Science and Production, meaning not only can you research a lot of Technology quickly, but you can then make the product of your labor soon after too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His traits create a nice feedback loop around Production Buildings where constructing Production Buildings can be done fast, and he then gets extra Science for each one. He also benefits from having good relations with those around him, and can further his Science generation by entering into Endeavors. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Charlemagne</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Military and Science Buildings receive a Happiness adjacency for Quarters. Gain 2 free Cavalry Units, once unlocked, when entering a Celebration.</li><li>+5 Combat Strength for Cavalry Units during a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Military and Science are always a powerful combination, allowing you to be on the cutting edge of new warfare Technologies, and then pressing that advantage. Charlemagne is encouraged to push for Military and Science buildings to help prop up some powerful Happiness traits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as he can keep his population happy, he can continually enter Celebrations, which in turn gives him free Cavalry Units. While that’s going on too, these already strong early and mid-game units gain even more strength. It’s a very horse-centric strategy, but stampeding over your fellow Civilizations is a very strong tactic in the early parts of the game. While he may struggle more in the Modern Age once the likes of Tanks and Planes are introduced, he should be established with a very strong empire by then. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Harriet Tubman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+100% Influence towards Initiating Espionage Actions.</li><li>Gain 5 War Support on all wars declared against you.</li><li>Units ignore movement penalties from Vegetation.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Harriet Tubman is undoubtedly one of the stealthiest choices in Civilization 7. Influence can be a powerful yield, and Harriet can wield it perhaps most powerfully of all. She can cause some real trouble for other Civilizations by messing with them through means of Espionage, allowing you to disrupt or steal advantages from others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you get caught and anger a powerful force, the 5 War Support you get when a war is declared against you is an enormous drain on them, that should allow you to grind out a victory. On top of that, her armies are nimble, and able to ignore vegetation, making her hard to pin down, tricksy, and a pain to deal with when she’s defending. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Hatshepsut</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Culture for every imported Resource.</li><li>+15% Production towards the construction of Buildings and Wonders in Cities adjacent to Navigable Rivers.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Hatshepsut can get access to really strong spikes in Culture. It benefits her to have good relationships and establish Trade Routes for imported Resources. She gets +1 Culture for each one, so every time she enters into a trade with another civilization, it gives her a nice boost of Culture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’s also one of the very best at producing Wonders, but also, Buildings in general. This makes her very strong in the early Culture Legacy Paths. While she needs to be utilizing a Navigable River, most cities should be on one anyway, so this is not a difficult requirement to satisfy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Himiko, High Shaman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Happiness per Age on Happiness Buildings.</li><li>+50% Production towards constructing Happiness Buildings.</li><li>+20% Culture but -10% Science, and these effects are doubled while in a Celebration.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Himiko is perhaps the best producer of Culture in Civilization 7. Her traits are very powerful, and the mixture it has with Happiness is a potent one. Constructing Happiness Buildings is fast thanks to the production bonus, and the Happiness Buildings only get stronger with age. She also gets a ridiculous +20% passive boost to Culture, which doubles during Celebrations, further feeding into Happiness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it comes with drawbacks. She also has a -10% passive to Science, which also doubles during a celebration. This will require you to be aware of your handicap and work around it. That said, as long as you either utilize Endeavors or compensate for the Science loss with Buildings and resources, these potential peaks of Culture boosts far outweigh the negative Science nerf. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Isabella</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 300 Gold every time you discover a Natural Wonder, doubled if the Natural Wonder is in Distant Lands.</li><li>+100% additional tile yields from Natural Wonders.</li><li>+50% Gold towards purchasing Naval Units, and -1 Gold maintenance cost for Naval Units.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Isabella can absolutely catapult herself early on if she can find a Natural Wonder. Especially in the Antiquity Age, if found early enough, 300 Gold is a massive boon. This allows her to buy units or buildings that should put her quite a bit ahead if done at the right time. If she is able to incorporate the Natural Wonder into her borders too, she will get massive tile Yields, making it again, very powerful the earlier you can do it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this of course is dependent on your finding and securing the Natural Wonders. She can fall victim to unlucky map placement. If there’s no nearby Natural Wonder early on, then she’s not going to be getting many benefits. That said, no matter what, she should have a strong Navy, by buying water-based Units and maintaining them with no problem.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Jose Rizal</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>When gaining rewards from Narrative Events, gain an additional 20 Culture and Gold per Age.</li><li>Has additional Narrative Events.</li><li>+50% Celebration duration.</li><li>+50% Happiness towards Celebrations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Jose Rizal is a master of Celebrations. The 50% Celebration Duration and +50% Happiness towards Celebrations tandem is very strong. This can help him make massive gains with powerful Celebration effects, especially if he moves in the direction of Culture. He will have Celebrations often and have them active for longer. That’s excellent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also gets nice boosts of Culture and Gold for the Narrative Events he participates in and thankfully they happen more frequently to him than over civs. While these likely won’t sway a game on their own, they are a nice garnish on the Celebration synergy available to him. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Machiavelli</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+3 influence per Age.</li><li>Gains 50 Gold per Age when your Diplomatic Action proposals are accepted or 100 Gold when they are rejected.</li><li>Ignore Relationship requirements for declaring Formal Wars.</li><li>Can Levy Military Units from City-States you are not Suzerin of.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Machiavelli is a great option for those who like to get positively devious. He has a powerful synergy of Influence and Gold that makes him a threat at all times. While he may not be on the offensive every second, his ability to ignore Relationship Requirements to declare wars means even allies aren’t safe from a stab in the back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even his apparent power level can be deceptive, as thanks to his ability to gain a lot of Gold from Diplomatic Actions made with his Influence, he can buy meaningful military force quickly. On top of that, he has the very powerful ability to levy units from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Independent_Powers:_All_Types_and_Bonuses">City-States</a> he isn’t Suzerain of. He’s not best at taking on strong armies and has to be considered in his actions, but he excels at a smash-and-grab playstyle, even at the expense of his friends. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Trung Trac</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 3 free Levels on your first Army Commander.</li><li>+20% Commander experience.</li><li>+10% Science in Cities in Tropical Spaces. This bonus is doubled while in a Formal War you declare.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Trung Trac is the master of utilizing the powerful new Army Commander units. These units let you command multiple units at once while providing them with powerful bonuses. While they aren’t necessarily the strongest to begin with, the more levels they get, the more of a deciding factor they become. Trung Trac not only gets 20% Commander Experience, but her Commanders spawn with three free levels. This can make for some pretty sizeable spikes in military power that can influence wars. If her Commanders get really powerful and get multiple Commendations too, her armies will be some of the most powerful on the map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She also gets a nice boost to Science on Tropical Spaces, a whopping 20% boostwhen at war, supercharging the formidable Science and Military combo. That said, it’s map-dependent, as she will need access to those Tropical tiles. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Xerxes, The Achaemenid</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Trade Route limit with all other leaders.</li><li>+50 Culture and 100 Gold per Age when you create a Trade Route or Road.</li><li>+1 Culture and Gold per Age on Unique Buildings and Unique Improvements.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Xerxes, The Achaemenid has access to a nice variety of yields and benefits. The 100 Gold and 50 Culture he gets from creating Trade Routes and Roads are excellent and can provide you with massive spikes of both if you set up multiple around the same time. Considering he gets access to one extra Trade Route too for each Leader, there is a nice synergy here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s only helped by his buff to Culture and Gold on Unique Buildings and Improvements. Make no mistake, this is a massive amount of both, and when utilized properly, it’s very, very strong. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">B-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-b-tier-1744891910688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Amina</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Resource Capacity in Cities.</li><li>+1 Gold per Age for each Resource assigned to Cities.</li><li>+5 Combat Strength on all Units in Plains or Desert.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Amina is definitely a decent Leader who does well with Resources. Resources are powerful in Civilization 7, so having access to more is not a bad thing. While the +1 capacity is nice to have, the +1 Gold per Age for each Resource assigned to Cities is an excellent Gold generator. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you will need to get access to as many Resources as possible while housing them too, so that is where your game plan should be focused. Her Units getting a +5 Combat Strength on all Units in Plains or Desert is a bit situational, but it could come in clutch in the right circumstances. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Catherine the Great</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+2 Culture per Age on displayed Great Works. Building with Great Works slot gain 1 additional slot.</li><li>Cities settled in Tundra gain Science equal to a percentage of their Culture per turn.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Catherine the Great is generally a great producer of Culture. Displaying Great Works is a part of the Culture Legacy Path, so her getting access to extra slots to display them can be useful when trying to run through that as fast as possible. The Culture boost for doing so will also feed more Great Works, making a nice feedback loop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, she can be a little situational. Her cities being on Tundra do make for excellent Science output in tandem with her Culture generation. That said, if you can’t settle on Tundras or their barrenness ends up hurting you in terms of resources, she can be a little trickier to utilize. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Friedrich, Oblique</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Army Commanders start with the Merit Commendation, granting them additional Command Radius. </li><li>Gain an Infantry Unit when you construct a Science Building.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Oblique version of Friedrich is likely his better option, though he’s still far from the best in the game. That isn’t to say he isn’t without merit though. Army Commanders are strong Units and the Merit Commendations provide the most powerful effects among them. Starting with one of those is a good way to boost your army's power early on. The additional Command Radius is as powerful as any buffs and debuffs, allowing you to affect more Units. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also can get an Infantry Unit when constructing a Science Building, which is a nice incentive to put your Gold and Production into those. That said, he has no access to Science, Influence, or Culture buffs. Even for a scientific-focused Civilization, he can end up hurting his viability a bit as he will likely lag behind other specialists. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Ibn Battuta</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain 2 Wildcard Attribute Points after the first Civic in every Age.</li><li>+1 Sight for all Units.</li><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Trade Maps that allows you to gradually see other Leaders’ Explored area.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Ibn Battuta could become a powerful Civilization if played correctly, though he is so versatile, his strengths may not be apparent to those not sure how to utilize Attribute Points. Getting 2 of these after the first Civic in each Age means that he is flexible, and can spec himself into the situation he finds himself in. That said, with that flexibility comes more choice and complexity that might be a little unwieldy for new players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, his visibility of the map granted from stealing other Explored areas and the extra sight from units is something that can be powerful in experienced hands. However that value might not be apparent to those less versed in how to make use of that information. He brings a lot to the table and is very flexible. Just be sure you know how to utilize that. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Lafayette</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Reform, which grants an additional Social Policy slot. Supporting this Endeavor also grants the other leader an additional Social Policy Slot.</li><li>+1 Combat Strength for every Tradition, but not Policy, slotted into Government.</li><li>+1 Culture and Happiness per Age in Settlements, doubled in Distant Lands.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Lafayette has access to some nice traits, though they aren’t the most eye-catching in isolation. Him being able to use Reform to get additional Social Policy Slots is nice, and can help provide yield boosts. The +1 Combat Strength he gets from Traditions too is nothing to sniff at. That said, even with yield-focused policies, he may struggle to keep up with more specialised Leaders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The +1 to Culture and Happiness per Age, which is doubled in Distant Lands, is a completely unconditional buff though. That’s nice to have. This all comes together to make him a good Civilization, with a nice selection of good traits, though nothing here is entirely compelling here on its own. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Napoleon, Emperor</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Sanction called Continental System that reduces the Trade Route limit of the targeted Leader to all other Leaders. Causes massive Relationship penalty, and costs more to reject.</li><li>+8 Gold per Age for every Leader you are Unfriendly or Hostile with.</li><li>Can reject endeavors for Free.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Napoleon, Emperor is for those who like being a bit of a brat. He gets benefits from being a troll, gaining a very good +8 Gold for every Leader he is Unfriendly or Hostile with. That can be a lot if he’s annoying everyone. His Continental System Sanction messes with other civilizations’ ability to trade, making it an excellent option to tick off his neighbors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty comes in managing that dislike. This means it will be very hard to enter into Endeavors, or even keep Open Borders with those around you. Of course, it will also paint an enormous target on your back. Since he provides no buffs to his Units militarily, that’s a dangerous game. So, if you’re going to be a jerk to everyone, make sure you have the army to back it up just in case the consequences of your actions catch up to you. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Napoleon, Revolutionary</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Movement for all Land Units.</li><li>Defending an enemy unit provides Culture equal to 50% percent of its Combat Strength.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Napoleon, Revolutionary is an interesting Leader. All of his land units get +1 movement which is helpful when trying to both traverse large areas, as well as being nimble when maneuvering around enemy units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, how you utilize his other trait is likely going to be what decides if you do well with him or not. Culture equal to 50% of enemy Combat Strength when defending can be very spikey, giving you a lot of Culture if you find yourself defending multiple times per turn. However, to make the best of this, you need to find yourself in this position relatively often. That means you’re going to want to be provoking enemies, but holding your ground. It’s a pretty unique playstyle and may be a bit awkward for some. But if used well, it could be a big source of Culture. Just expect to be putting other resources into maintaining your army as you continually take hits. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Tecumseh</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>+1 Food and Production per Age in Settlements for every City-State you are Suzerain of.</li><li>+1 Combat Strength for all your Units for every City-State you are Suzerin of.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Tecumseh has the potential to be very good, but it will need time and setup. He is all about becoming the Suzerain of City-States. If you can rack up three or four of these, that’s a significant bonus to Food and Production, as well as Combat Strength.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue is that becoming a Suzerain takes a lot of Influence and he doesn’t have an inherent trait that helps. So he will need a good pairing with a Civilization, Policy, and Buildings/Districts to facilitate this. On top of that, it will just take time for you to get the Influence you need and convince these states they should come under your wing. However, if you have the infrastructure for it, the rewards can be pure and consistent value. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Himiko, Queen of Wa</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a unique Endeavor called Friend of Wei that can be performed in an Alliance to grant you and your ally +25% Science.</li><li>+4 Science per Age for every Leader you are Friendly or Helpful with.</li><li>Can support Endeavors for free.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Himiko, Queen of Wa is the opposite of Napoleon, Emperor. She is all about being everyone’s best friend, and if you can maintain that, you will reap enormous benefits. The +4 Science per Age for every Leader you’re Friendly or Helpful with is only helped by the Friend of Wei Endeavor. Multiply that by several allies, and that’s serious Science production. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, you do have to be a little careful with it too. Make sure being nice to everyone doesn’t come at the cost of your defensive military. Your Technological advances and sunny demeanor may make others jealous, so don’t get caught out thinking everyone is your friend. That can go out the window quickly when they want what you have. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">C-Tier Leaders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/civ-7-c-tier-1744891945200.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Friedrich, Baroque</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gain a Great Work when you capture a Settlement for the first time. </li><li>Gain an Infantry Unit when you construct a Culture Building.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Friedrich, Baroque has two traits and neither is particularly strong or distinct. Gaining a Great Work for capturing a Settlement for the first time is decent, but is unlikely to outright help you win games. In a field of very strong Leader traits, this feels merely ‘fine’. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaining an Infantry Unit when building a Culture Building is also useful, and can help fuel your military ambitions, but it’s not exactly going to make up for having no yield bonuses here. There are just many stronger options when it comes to Culture and your Military. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Pachacuti</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>All Buildings gain a +1 Food adjacency bonus for Mountains. </li><li>Specialists adjacent to Mountains do not cost Happiness maintenance</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Pachacuti is not a bad Leader. In fact, in some games, he can be exceptional. The problem is, he can also do next to nothing if the map hasn’t favored you. To excel, you need Mountains. If he can settle near them, then he will get good access to a good amount of Food and have little drawback from Specialists. That can be really good, especially when paired with Civilizations that utilize Mountains too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, that’s a strict requirement. Without Mountains, he provides little else, so if you spawn on a map with none around you, you’re out of luck. Of course, you can start over, or move the map sliders in your favor before picking him, but if you want a neutral experience where you start and play on a normal map, know you’re rolling the dice when you start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

who might have bought the game outright. Kingsley said he agrees that this may be true "a little bit" because he believes many Game Pass subscribers are "hardcore" gamers who might be inclined to buy a new IP like Atomfall.</p><p>However, "What you gain from that cost is disproportionate," he said.</p><p>Kingsley went on to say that Game Pass can help a game like Atomfall because people might try it and then tell their friends about it. "Some of them are on Game Pass, and will [play] it. But some of them aren't on Game Pass, and will also want to be part of that conversation. So, they'll go and buy it," he said.</p><p>At least, that's what Kingsley thinks. He admitted, "We don't have the data in for that."
