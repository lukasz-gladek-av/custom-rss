            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When you look at the state of the video game industry today, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">long-running studios with veteran talent</a> and brand-new teams (even ones built with veteran devs) get laid off entirely <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">after their first project flops</a>, it's easy to say that each new game hitting the market has <strong>a lot </strong>riding on it. In that general economic sense, <strong>ZA/UM's</strong> upcoming espionage CRPG, <strong>Zero Parades: For Dead Spies,</strong> has a lot riding on it. But it also carries a heavier burden than other new titles.</p>



<p>Few games have to deal with trying to best a predecessor that is as well-regarded as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-a-tapestry-of-beautiful-mistakes/">Disco Elysium</a></strong>, and fewer still have to do it while carrying the weight of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEAs6M1wts">well-documented</a> controversy that has yet to be fully resolved, if that'll ever happen. And Zero Parades isn't just trying to distract you from controversy; it's trying to be so good that you forget that the controversy in question drove out the original core writing team behind Disco. It has to be so good that it convinces you the studio's art collective foundation is still alive and well, and that it hasn't been squashed by executive greed. </p>



<p>It has to be so good that Disco faithfuls still feel like they're playing a game from ZA/UM, the team that brought them Disco Elysium, even if so many key members of that team are no longer there and didn't actually work on it.</p>



<p>If it isn't good enough to accomplish those things for the majority of people who give it a shot, particularly for Disco Elysium fans, then the cloud hanging over the studio will only grow larger and darker, making it even more difficult to step out of Disco's shadow.</p>



<p>Excited as I was based on what I saw in my hands-off preview of Zero Parades: For Dead Spies back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">September 2025</a></strong>, during which I got to hear from writer <strong>Jim Ashilevi </strong>and producer <strong>Jess Crawford</strong>, I walked away from that asking myself if it could be that good, and now that I've spent some significant time with it in its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES_For_Dead_Spies/">Steam Next Fest</a> </strong>demo, I feel like it has that chance.</p>

<p>One thing I want to get out of the way: I have not played Disco Elysium. I know, it's one of the most revered games of the last decade, and it's a pretty significant blind spot in my gaming history as someone who will tell you that they like narrative-driven games. But everyone has those kinds of blind spots, and I don't think coming to a series/franchise/style of game with a fresh perspective is any less valuable than coming to it with experience. There will be a lot of critics who are constantly comparing this to Disco Elysium, so I have no doubt you'll be able to find that perspective if you want it.</p>



<p>But that's not my angle, so now that we're all on the same page, I want to start out by saying there's a lot about Zero Parades that is very striking when you first load into the demo. Its opening moments feel like they are trying to put you immediately off balance as you enter the world of Zero Parades. It reminded me of how the opening of The Shining sets the tone by starting the audience in the air, in the middle of a lake, with the score immediately going to work to raise the tension and your anxiety, like there's some kind of impending doom. A fitting opening considering that one of the key takeaways I got from my preview of Zero Parades last September was the notion that players should <strong>"<em>embrace failure</em>."</strong></p>

<p>After you've chosen a couple of key traits that your version of the player character, Hershel Wilk, will start with, you're greeted by a quote from <strong>Jenny Holzer,</strong> "<em>The beginning of the war will be a secret</em>," followed by a deep, partially muffled voice that practically roars out the words, "<em>I once knew a spy</em>," while the screen looks like you're trying to play a VHS tape that still barely works. </p>



<p>From that opening conversation, you start your journey in a small apartment, and as you investigate your surroundings, you start to learn more about your player character and the game's setting. Hershel is a spy for Superbloc, one of the three superpowers in this world made up of a union of communist nations, and this is not her first time in Portofiro. She was here years ago, working with a group of contacts who grew to be her friends, friends she chose to <strong>abandon</strong> when things went south.</p>



<p>The Opera, the Superbloc's espionage firm, put her 'in the freezer,' which is another way of saying they chained her to a desk job for five years after making such a mess with her last job. Now, she's back, and you quickly learn (or don't, depending on the dialogue choices you make), that she's there because one of her former contacts reached out, asking for her specifically.</p>

<p>It's at this point that the story of Zero Parades: For Dead Spies begins, with Hershel standing in a cramped apartment space, with her 'double,' the Operant (the Opera's word for spy), she was supposed to meet barely alive in an armchair, unable to move or do much of anything. Known to you as Psuedopod, he was meant to give you your assignment brief, and you were supposed to move forward from there. Now, you have to figure out what he had been investigating before you got there, and try to find out who got to Psuedopod before whatever mission you're meant to be on could even get going.</p>



<p>I don't want to dig too much into narrative spoiler territory here - the demo is <strong>out today with the launch of Steam Next Fest</strong> if you want to play it yourself, and if I go through every story detail, not only will this be an incredibly long preview, but it'll take away from your experience of actually playing it. What I will say is that even without playing Disco, I can understand why the team at ZA/UM was praised for their storytelling.</p>



<p>Every element - the environmental design, the art, the writing - just made me want to keep digging, to know more. I've spent almost half a dozen hours in this demo, and even after playing through it more than once, I still want to spend more time with it, just to be in this world for a little longer.</p>

<p>The narrative was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the strongest element of Zero Parades so far, based on my time with it. It has me so interested that I'm almost starting to get over my least favourite aspect of the game, which, unfortunately, has to do with Hershel, specifically her voice. I'm not ripping into the voice actor's performance here, I'm ripping into the director's choices. I don't know why ZA/UM chose to have Hershel sound like she has <strong>permanent vocal fry</strong>, but it was incredibly grating on my ears when I first heard it.</p>



<p>She doesn't carry it for every line - if one of the traits you upgrade is 'Records,' which increases Hershel's ability to recall historical facts, plenty of those lines will sound perfectly fine. But so much of her inner dialogue of thoughts is read with a tone that sounds like it's trying too hard to be dark and gritty. It was genuinely a pain to listen to at first, and I was thankful that by my second playthrough of the demo, I could skip through lines I had heard before just to hear less of it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, none of the other voices you'll hear in the demo are nearly as bad. They're not bad at all, frankly, and it makes it even more curious as to why the actors behind those voices were directed so well, while Hershel's actor was seemingly told to sound like she is almost incapable of speaking with her full voice. And when I say I'm 'starting to get over' how bad she is to listen to, it's because I'm growing to tolerate it for the sake of experiencing everything else.</p>

<p>What I'm not tolerating are its more interactive bits, i.e. the dice rolls and one of Zero Parades' new mechanics, <strong>Dramatic Encounters</strong>. When I first heard about them in the presentation I attended for my September preview, I was extremely skeptical. They didn't exactly sound enticing, and frankly, they seemed like they might be an attempt at adding a deeper gameplay layer for people who may need some convincing to play such a dialogue-heavy game in the first place. What I found was that they are a really clever solution to adding tense espionage-driven gameplay.</p>



<p>Some of my favourite moments in the dense spy stories I love (the kind that Ashilevi and Crawford told me inspired Zero Parades) are those moments where the scene might not devolve into an action-heavy moment, but the pressure in the room gets to its absolute peak just before it's about to blow. So far, that's what playing these Dramatic Encounters felt like, and I'm very happy to have been wrong about them.</p>



<p>I also appreciate the de-skilling mechanic that occurs whenever you max out on one of three core feelings: Fatigue, Anxiety, and Delirium. Any of these getting raised beyond a halfway point indicated in the bottom left gives you that permanent status condition, and maxing out forces you to lose a skill point. It wasn't always obvious which dialogue choices would lead to my anxiety or something else going up, so I can see how you might get annoyed by that. I read it more as another layer of long-term game strategy, as I'll likely have to go back and forth, and probably discover which skills I need/want to keep raised along the way and which I don't mind losing a point in.</p>

<p>Coming back to the espionage, it also feels like a way of translating the human realities or perceived realities of espionage work. So many spy stories want you to believe that their heroes could always handle the pressure, no matter how tense things got. Maybe that was true for Hershel once, but it's not true after what sounds like the greatest failure of her career. She's more vulnerable now and can't handle being out in the field and investigating like she could before. It feels more honest that she would struggle, regroup, and build her strength back, just as the player does whenever they put a skill point back somewhere it was lost.</p>

<p>I made it clear that I won't be able to tell you if this is feeling better or worse than Disco Elysium. What I can tell you, as someone with no capacity for comparison and thought on what the 'old' ZA/UM might've done with this game, is that this is a game I absolutely did not know I needed that is now one of my most anticipated titles this year.</p>



<p>It's right up my alley with its espionage angle, and while I'm honestly still a little bit concerned that I'll never hear a better side to Hershel as long as the game goes on, this game has more than enough going for it for me to eventually get over it. If the story, art, characters, Dramatic Encounters, investigative gameplay, and Conditioning can come together to and bottle the feeling of these cloak-and-dagger activities mixed with high stakes political and ideological drama and themes like they've done in this demo across a whole game, this is absolutely a Game of the Year contender for 2026, assuming it's out this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, we are days away from the global release of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, the ninth mainline entry in <strong>Capcom's</strong> long-running, beloved horror series. It's an exciting time for fans of the series and horror fans, but it's also a tense time to be online, because there are plenty of <strong>spoilers online</strong> to be found. While Capcom has already <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590">issued a plea to fans</a> asking them not to share these spoilers, industry icon and director of <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong>, <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong>, has a different take on these spoilers getting out there.</p>



<p>In its statement, Capcom says, "<em>Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem,</em>" adding that its legal team will continue to take down every pre-release post it can in order to preserve people's day one experience with the game. It concludes with the obvious point that "<em>It's not long now until the game is out, so we look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kamiya was not nearly as kind with his reaction to the leaks. He responded to Capcom's statement on his own <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, and told those sharing leaks and spoilers ahead of release (via machine translation) that they "<em><strong>deserve to die a thousand deaths</strong></em>," and cursed them to "<em><strong>never play games again</strong></em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I remember back with Bio2 [Resident Evil 2] the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right</em>," Kamiya begins. "<em>For your own selfish satisfaction, you're <strong>trampling</strong> all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that <strong>destroys everyone's happiness and deserves a thousand deaths</strong>.

<p>With big games like this, it's more often a miracle if they don't get leaked early, but once physical copies are sent to retail stores, these kinds of leak cycles almost always happen. As much as Kamiya despises the practice, there will always be those who can't wait a few extra days.</p>



<p>Requiem is expected to be one of Capcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shares-soar-great-sales-forecast-resident-evil-requiem/">biggest games for the year</a>, and could even be one of the biggest games in the Resident Evil series if it is able to surpass its most recent predecessor in the eyes of players. There's a lot <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">we've been hearing about the game</a> that makes it sound more interesting and exciting than other titles in the series, and long-time fans are very keen to learn about the next chapter in <a href="https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/">Leon Kennedy's story</a>, as he's arguably the most iconic character from the franchise.</p>



<p>If you're excited for Requiem but won't be searching these spoilers out, you can check out the short film that Capcom released to set the tone for the game, titled<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/"> 'Evil Has Always Had a Name.'</a></strong> A title that, in light of Kamiya's statement, makes you think the name Hideki Kamiya would give to 'evil' might be 'leakers.' </p>

            <p>Thanks to various life difficulties, I’ve spent this month in a state of immense spiritual turbulence, oscillating between euphoria and despair. As such, I’m in either the worst or the perfect frame of mind to digest news that Yoko Taro, director and scenario writer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">NieR: Automata</a>, is writing a new series of Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/2/23/new-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-series-in-production?srsltid=AfmBOoodHSUS0nCbgYxViT3XtpATfsQriqxo3f5u9bNbJDDCWghPWeyn">Crunchyroll</a>, the show in question has just been announced at Evangelion’s 30th anniversary festivities. It’s a collaboration between Studio Khara and CloverWorks. Kazuya Tsurumaki, director of the Rebuild films and Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, is leading the project alongside Toko Yatabe, assistant director on Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time. Taro isn’t the only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> alumnus involved - NieR composer Keiichi Okabe is providing the music. </p>
<p>Truly, the Nier Automata guy doing an Evangelion show is a match made in… some kind of metaphysical realm. Do I really have to draw my breath in pain to explain why? I’ve just referenced Hamlet in that last sentence, which should give you a hint as to the psychic pressures involved. If you know, you know. If you don’t, please google it and skim past the <del>Absolute Terror</del> AI summary to read one of the thousands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-automatas-secret-church-mystery-chaos-community-and-an-amazing-mod">wondering</a>, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2002-06-11">tortured</a> things written about either Nier or Evangelion.</p>
<p>Apart from anything else, I haven’t caught up on all the Evangelion released after the original 90s TV show. I’ve only gotten as far as the nightmare fuel that is Asuka vs the Mass Production Evas in The End of Evangelion. People who’ve watched the latest stuff: is it… more cheerful these days?</p>
<p>If you’ve come to this videogame website to read about videogames, not anime shows, rest assured that Taro is still pitching ‘em – they just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-creator-yoko-taro-would-like-you-to-know-he-has-been-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-cancelled">keep getting cancelled</a>.</p>

I’m a little bummed they didn’t do any for Mega Evolutions, but I can’t complain too much when every monster is represented here. There’s over 1000 images here, so if you want to find your favorites, it’s probably easiest to do a ctrl+f or command+f and search their names. I found my team on my phone this morning and that was a pain in the ass. But look at my boy:</span></p>

In 2Q25, Omdia estimated that the combined memory in a base PS5 accounted for at least 20% of the overall bill of materials of the console.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tencent-shutters-timi-montreal" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Tencent quietly shutters Timi Montreal</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once manufacturers run through their inventories, new devices will be built with memory supplies that will have been negotiated at a higher contract price.

Figure 1 highlights how content and services are the bulk of consumer spend on games console platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, one likely event in 2026 is Nintendo adjusting the pricing of Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions upward. Omdia estimates average ASP growth between the end of 2021 and 2025 for all Nintendo Switch Online tiers was just 8%, compared with 40% for PlayStation Plus and 72% for Xbox Game Pass.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, we will see a reattribution of pricing of upcoming first-party content, subscription services, and peripherals.

It is the publishing opportunity on Nintendo platforms that will be the most exposed as the vast majority of major new and upcoming first-and third-party software has transitioned to Switch 2, a platform in its infancy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embark-studios-ceo-patrick-soderlund-named-executive-chairman-of-nexon" target="_self" data-discover="true">Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund named executive chairman of Nexon</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Entry-level hardware in the console market will be a casualty. Historically, the last-generation system could provide an affordable entry point into a games catalog for a platform holder.

PC gamers may delay a full upgrade and PC desktop builders may delay component upgrades. Handheld gaming PCs, an emerging product category, may continue to only address an enthusiast audience. For gaming laptops, PC vendors are expected to focus on driving sales of high-end models to maximize revenue as supply is constrained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, this is likely to pose little challenge for most developers given pre-existing work optimizing games for power-constrained devices such as Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also a growing installed base of gaming-capable laptops that remain unaddressed by many games publishers. The capabilities of built-in processor graphics have improved significantly in recent years, providing performance that exceeds Steam Deck and, at the high end, exceeds Xbox Series S. Data from Omdia's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PC Horizon Service</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveals over 90 million gaming-capable laptops were sold in 2025. Publishers should consider addressing the subset of laptop owners that also plays games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sales volumes and value of PC games content is not expected to be disrupted – there already exists a huge and healthy audience of installed devices well-positioned to buy PC games content. Omdia estimates that in 2025, Steam alone had 321 million yearly active users.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected">The attach rates of Switch 2 software may be affected</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the 1980s, chip shortages placed upward pressure on the manufacturing cost of Famicom cartridges and facilitated the creation of the Famicom Disc System, which used a cheaper proprietary floppy-disc format.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This situation is repeating itself with Switch 2 physical media, as the standard game cards are becoming prohibitively expensive to accommodate publishers' pricing strategies. Like its predecessor, Switch 2 remains a physical-first platform. When including bundled software, Omdia estimates 57% of Switch 2 games sold in 2025 were at retail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expectation in 2026 is that publishers shipping software in high volumes will continue to opt for the dataless Game-Key Card to protect margins and hit lower price points at retail—both at, and following, the launch of a title. The exception is niche titles that reach a highly engaged audience of collectors – this audience is less sensitive to price, so publishers should explore the possibility of charging a higher price to publish a game fully on the game card.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game-Key Cards do present one issue for the publishing opportunity on Switch 2. The device features just 230GB of useable internal storage – the lowest of any current generation console. With the cost of expandable SD Express storage also expected to rise, software attach rates could be affected once enough "forever games" supplant themselves on players' systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers will be forced to take action to control server costs">Developers will be forced to take action to control server costs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As outlined in Omdia's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2026 Trends to Watch – Games Tech,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competition for data center capacity from AI is going to make infrastructure costs a top concern for game studio CTOs in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Let’s get this out of the way up front: the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 are both selling really well right now. But one of those consoles is five years old and the other has only been out for nine months after years of waiting. So why is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">Sony’s machine continuing</a> to outsell Nintendo’s latest portable device in the U.S.?</p> <p>Circana Senior Director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfovqnc2r">Mat Piscatella reports</a> that PS5 still led January 2026 in hardware sales in the U.S. despite people buying fewer PS5s than they did a year ago. Switch 2 was in second place, followed by Xbox Series X/S and PC gaming handhelds. Overall, hardware spending jumped 16 percent compared to January 2025, even as last-gen hardware declined. PS5 was down 17 percent year-over-year and Xbox Series X/S was down 27 percent. Unsurprisingly, the original Switch fell off a cliff with a 79 percent drop.</p>

 <p>Is this indicative of the ongoing strength of the PS5 platform, or does it mean unusual softness in Switch 2 launch year sales? Recent earnings reports showed that Nintendo lost the holiday period worldwide to Sony as well. Despite Switch 2 surpassing Switch 1 sales on a time-aligned basis, it was beaten by five-year-old hardware. Maybe some of that was the big Black Friday price cuts that made a PS5 cheaper than a Switch 2. Maybe it was people gearing up for the launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> this year.</p> <p>And maybe part of it had to do with the Switch 2 missing a big exclusive to get people off the fence. Neither a 3D <em>Mario</em> nor a new<em> Zelda</em> have been announced yet and 2025’s big seller, Pokémon<em> Legends: Z-A</em>, was available on the existing Switch. Things might only get tougher if and when Nintendo is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">forced to increase the price</a> of the Switch 2 due to the ongoing RAM shortage, something new reporting and many analysts suggest is a forgone conclusion for 2026.</p>

 <p>Then again, President Trump’s tariffs <a href="https://kotaku.com/supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs-that-hiked-prices-on-switch-xbox-and-ps5-2000671987">were just struck down as unconstitutional</a>. I’m not sure how the government is planning on refunding consumers or companies for those import taxes, but maybe it will give Nintendo the wiggle room it needs to hold the Switch 2’s current $450 price for a bit longer.</p>

It may also take place after one of the series’ multiple endings across the original show, the </span><i><span>End of Evangelion</span></i><span> film, and the </span><i><span>Rebuilds</span></i><span>.

It sounds like original </span><i><span>Evangelion </span></i><span>creator Hideaki Anno isn’t involved at a top level beyond his studio Khara producing the show, which, given the way </span><i><span>Thrice Upon a Time </span></i><span>ended, that’s probably a good thing.

 <p><span>The announcement was the culmination of the Evangelion:30+; 30th Anniversary of </span><i><span>Evangelion </span></i><span>festival in Japan, which also included a 13-minute short starring Asuka, which has reignited the spark of a decades-long shipping war by showing a vision of her married to main character Shinji and having a kid.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a big week for Pokémon fans with the 30th anniversary celebrations taking place this week, and fresh rumors have emerged concerning a huge collab with Fortnite.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is the undisputed behemoth in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> scene, while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> is the strongest franchise among the creature-collecting games. For many, that may seem like a natural fit for a collab.</p>



<p>If you want to know what the source of the Fortnite x Pokémon rumors is, and whether a crossover is on the cards, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite">Is Pokémon Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not likely. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no official news regarding a collab between Fortnite and Pokémon. While it’s not been ruled out either, it seems unlikely to occur.</strong></p>



<p>While Epic Games are the masters of collabs, bringing the likes of South Park, Star Wars, and major anime titles into the game, working with Nintendo provides different challenges. So far, Epic Games and Nintendo haven’t managed to come to an agreement.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-want-to-see-announced-on-pokemon-day-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things We Want to See Announced on Pokémon Day</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Fortnite previously wanted to bring Samus from the Metroid franchise into the game, but Nintendo wanted significant restrictions. It’s been widely reported they only wanted Samus to be playable on Nintendo consoles, even if you already owned the skin.</p>



<p>Additionally, Pokémon is a family-friendly franchise, and while it’s no denying the likes of Pikachu and Eevee would make amazing Sidekicks, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are unlikely to want their valuable IP running around in a world filled with guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-did-the-fortnite-x-pokemon-rumours-start">Where Did The Fortnite x Pokémon Rumours Start?</h2>



<p><strong>The desire from fans to bring Pokémon</strong> <strong>into the world of football is not new, but the rumors have been ramped up following a recent viral social media post.</strong></p>



<p>On Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVE04N_gT9X/?img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forthnite</a>, a page with over 2.7m followers, shared a fan-made trailer made by feraalsy that showcased what a collab between the two major franchises could look like.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Release Date</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The trailer was done expertly, showcasing the likes of Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, and Charizard in their full might, and went viral on social media. At the time of writing, the post has over 15.5k likes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as we’ve mentioned, the collab is likely to be a pipe dream, and if Nintendo were to partner with Fortnite, there are other franchises, including Zelda and Super Mario, more likely to feature first.</p>

"I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That latter sentence is particularly exciting, as it teases that publisher Take-Two is keen to see the film debut around the same time as a new BioShock game (or two). Exactly what is meant by "incarnations" remains to be seen, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed for timescales, Lee cautiously said: "It's steadily on the path, but you know how it goes. It's... so many things could get in the way, but I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">BioShock: The Collection Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix announced plans for a BioShock adaptation back in 2022, though the project has stalled due to budget cuts impacting the scope of the movie and its script. Prior to that, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski was working on his own adaptation, though that ultimately came to nothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut"><u>producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</u></a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption"><u>Lawrence told IGN at the time</u></a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next"><u>BioShock 4</u></a>? After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head"><u>layoffs and a further delay to the project's release</u></a>, former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson will now oversee Cloud Chamber and the project itself, which has been in development for the last decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Evangelion </em>series is on the way, and <em>NieR </em>auteur Yoko Taro will be penning it, with that series' composer Keiichi Okabe also providing the music.</p><p>The news was <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> via the official <em>Evangelion </em>website as part of the iconic anime series' 30th anniversary celebrations. We're using machine translation for the article announcing the <em>Evangelion </em>revival.</p><p>Yoko Taro will be scripting the series, with production being handled by CloverWorks and <em>Rebuild of Evangelion </em>outfit Studio Khara. Keiichi Okabe, who's written music not only for <em>NieR </em>but also for its predecessor series <em>Drakengard </em>(as well as <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>and more), will be on composition duties.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Direction will be handled by <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>'s Kazuya Tsurumaki and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Toko Yatabe, but beyond the staffers mentioned, we don't know much else about the new <em>Evangelion </em>series, including whether it'll be a reworked version of the original or an entirely new story.</p><p>What we do know, however, is that Yoko Taro has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spoken in the past</a> about how <em>Evangelion </em>influenced his work, and it's not hard to see how; like <em>Evangelion</em>, Taro's work combines high-octane action with deep philosophical themes (and, some might say, similarly nonsensical endings).</p><p>Whether or not production of the new <em>Evangelion </em>affects Taro and Okabe's work on <em>NieR </em>remains to be seen. It's worth noting that a new <em>NieR </em>game hasn't been released for around nine years; the last was 2017's <em>NieR: Automata</em>.</p><p>However, there may be cause to hope on that front. In a recent trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-10m-followup-tease-possibly" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8a6dece-ec13-453e-8894-717f0a1a0350" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announcing 10 million sales</a> for the game, a closing message simply read "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...", suggesting that more <em>NieR </em>(and perhaps even more <em>Automata</em>) could be on the way.</p>
<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while before we get more information about Yoko Taro's plans for <em>Evangelion</em>, and, indeed, his plans for <em>NieR</em> as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Logan Paul’s sale of the Illustrator Pikachu card last weekend made a lot of headlines, but they were almost entirely based on the extraordinary $16.5 million price paid for the plastic-cased piece of cardboard. However, what surrounds the sale, and the use of prediction market gambling, might perhaps be the real story.</p> <p>Before we get started, let’s be completely clear: we’re not accusing anyone mentioned of wrongdoing. Lots of questions are being asked, and we are interested in finding out their answers.</p> <p>On February 15, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">a weeks-long auction of Logan Paul’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card collection came to an end</a>, with winning bids exceeding the market prices for the listed cards by sometimes as much as 70 times. The standout among them was the PSA 10 Illustrator Pikachu, one of only 41 of the card ever printed, and the only one to have been graded a perfect 10; it sold for a record-smashing $16,492,000. That, of course, caused headlines around the world, as it was the most expensive collectible card sale of all time, fetching over three times more than any Pokémon card has ever sold for before.</p>

 <p>Unusually, the winning bidder for the card has been identified. It’s AJ Scaramucci, the venture capitalist son of financier and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who bought the card for $13.3 million, and then paid the extra $3.2 million in auction house Goldin’s fees. Even more unusually, Scaramucci is said to have <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2026/02/16/logan-paul-sells-rare-pokemon-card-auction/88701757007/#:~:text=Logan%20Paul%20bought%20the%20Pikachu,Feb.%2015%20at%20$13.3%20million.">“surprised” Goldin</a> by being in the company’s headquarters in person at the moment the sale completed. As Goldin put it in a press release, “Originally, Paul agreed to personally visit the winning bidder to hand-deliver the card; however, the winner shocked the crowd with his presence as he was already at Goldin HQ.” Thus there was the opportunity for a photoshoot with Paul and Scaramucci as the card was handed over, still attached to its garish chain <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">as worn during Wrestlemania</a>.</p> <h2>Cutting It Close</h2> <p>The obvious question is: why? Why did someone pay quite so much money for something that has no intrinsic value beyond being collectible. The answer, in so many directions, is money. Paul paid $5.275 million for the card in 2022 in an attention-seeking move, and obviously wanted to profit from that stunt. Scaramucci said he thought the card would one day be worth $100 million, so he presumably sees it as an investment. Goldin got to charge a seven-figure fee for hosting a page on their website for a bit. But even after all this, there was more money to be made.</p>

 <p>The card started its final night of the auction at $6.3 million, where it had sat throughout the final week of the 42-day auction, a modest increase from the massively over-inflated price Paul paid for the card four years ago. During this last day of bidding it rose to $6.882 million, where it stayed until the last moment. Auctioneers Goldin <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/insight/specials/entertainment/20260101-logan-pauls-pikachu-illustrator-sale-price-odds-76pp-chance-pauls-pikachu-sells-for-over-$7-million">had predicted</a> the card would sell for between $7 million and $12 million, and had already advanced Paul $2.5 million ahead of the sale (this was featured as part of the Netflix vanity documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81505384"><em>King of Collectibles</em></a>), so hopes were that it would still climb a little higher. Then, at the last moment, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/16/americas/pokemon-card-logan-paul-record-auction-intl-hnk#:~:text=As%20Monday's%20bidding%20drew%20to,million%20from%2097%20total%20bids.">a flurry of bids</a> came in during “an extended bidding period” when it suddenly shot up ten million to the unimaginable price of $16.5 million.</p>

 <p>Obviously, anyone who’s tried to buy something desirable on eBay is used to seeing prices skyrocket in the closing few minutes, but this was quite extraordinary. Fortunately, Guinness World Records were in the room <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2026/2/logan-pauls-rare-pokemon-card-becomes-most-expensive-ever-sold-in-record-setting-auction">to capture the record-breaking moment</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000672014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672014"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672014">© Goldin / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Speculative Betting</h2> <p>Attention then turns to Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-based prediction market where people can bet on absolutely anything they wish, so long as it’s in the future. Ahead of the final day, Polymarket was predicting a 72 percent chance the card would sell for over $7 million, meaning had it sold for the $6.882 million it was sitting at before the extended bidding, a lot of people would have been disappointed.</p>

 <p>However, Polymarket’s odds flipped much more in the better’s favor the moment that price went over $10 million. At $8m it sat at 61 percent, but at $10m that dropped to 40 percent. And as for $15 million: surely only a fool would have taken the odds of 11 percent. Because as <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/insight/specials/entertainment/20260101-logan-pauls-pikachu-illustrator-sale-price-odds-76pp-chance-pauls-pikachu-sells-for-over-$7-million"><em>Oddschecker</em> put it at the time</a>, “This would require a historic bidding war and a sale far above Goldin’s top estimate of $12 million. Traders view this as a long-shot outcome.”</p> <p>So that worked out rather well for <a href="https://polymarket.com/@0x4815162342">the person who won $265,217</a> betting it would hit super-high prices, especially given it was the account’s first ever and only Polymarket bet. In total, five bets were placed by the account:</p> <p>$98,814 at 58 percent for going over $10 million<br> $154,967 at 42 percent for going over $12m<br> $131,164 at 17 percent for going over $15 million<br> $195 at an unknown percentage for going over $18 million<br> $1,187 at an unknown percentage for going over $20 million</p>

 <p>This could look like the betting of a person who felt extremely confident that the price was going to hit between $12 and $15 million, and pretty certain it wasn’t going to reach $18 million, but figured it’d look suspicious if they didn’t put a bet there anyway.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone just won $265K correctly predicting the sale price of <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LoganPaul</a>’s Pokémon Illustrator card.</p> <p>This was his first and only bet ever on Polymarket.</p> <p>What did he know? <a href="https://t.co/rQA3p5jDNZ">pic.twitter.com/rQA3p5jDNZ</a></p> <p>— Car (@CarOnPolymarket) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarOnPolymarket/status/2023259200730611743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A few people have since raised questions about this, like X user @surgieboi who specializes in eBay actions of sports and TCG collectibles. Replying to Goldin’s CEO Ken Goldin’s boasting during the successful night (along with the most awkward video) as the price went over $13 million “AND RISING,” surgieboi asked, “<span>Was it rising before your $4,000,000 estimate pre-auction (screenshot attached of your own data), or after Logan, I mean the anonymous Polymarket account bet that the auction would cross $15,000,000?”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was it rising before your $4,000,000 estimate pre-auction (screenshot attached of your own data), or after Logan, I mean the anonymous Polymarket account bet that the auction would cross $15,000,000? </p> <p>Coincidentally, aligning one-to-one with this latest content push. I’m… <a href="https://t.co/CxR9ai7LDH">pic.twitter.com/CxR9ai7LDH</a></p> <p>— 𝖘𝖚𝖗𝖌𝖎𝖊𝖇𝖔𝖎 (@surgieboi) <a href="https://twitter.com/surgieboi/status/2023254753908490316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The reference to the $4 million figure comes from data embedded in Goldin’s website that shows the card was listed with “estimated_value: 4000000.” It’s unclear if this is just a placeholder or something official, and we’ve reached out to Goldin to ask. And indeed whether the auction house has any concerns regarding the Polymarket betting. And just to be clear, we’re in no way endorsing the many claims made by surgieboi in his post.</p> <h2>Liquidated Marketplace</h2> <p>This is not the first controversy surrounding the Illustrator Pikachu card since Logan Paul bought it, and a previous issue came back to bite him after the sale. Keen as the amateur boxing victim is on web3 nonsense, as seen in <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787">his experiments with NFTs</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze386d3enpo">forays into crypto</a>, in 2022 he attempted to sell “shares” in the card via Liquid Marketplace. Liquid Marketplace (LM), co-owned by Paul, was an online platform that allowed people to buy an imaginarily-sliced portion of a high-value collectible, and then hope that when it was resold they’d profit along with the owner. And boy, if you’d bet “No” on Polymarket over whether it would still be in good standing in 2026, you’d have made a profit. The <a href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2024-06/oth_20240619_liquid-marketplace.pdf">Canadian government has accused LM</a> of being a “multi-layered fraud,” saying the company had “misappropriated approximately $3 million, including through hidden payments to shell companies, for the personal enrichment of the LMP Principals.” (It’s important to note that Paul was not listed as one of these Principals, and nor does his name appear anywhere within the filing.)</p> <p>Paul had attempted to sell 51 percent of the Pikachu card on LM, but in the end only sold 5.4 percent for around $270,000. As the company fell apart, and customers began to panic, Paul says he bought the card back for the original price and ensured buyers that their investments could be withdrawn over the next year. <a href="https://x.com/LoganPaul/status/2023428274542563508">In a recent post on Logan Paul’s X account</a> after the sale, he addressed the controversy noting, “For reasons outside of my control, the LM site then went offline,” but claims he then paid to get the site back up and ensured any remaining money could be reclaimed. Oddly, he never mentions his co-ownership of the company at the center of all the problems.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">What an epic night. I’m truly grateful for the Pokémon community, Ken Goldin, and my team for making last night a historic moment for the hobby.</p> <p>To address concerns regarding the ownership history of the card, now for the facts:</p> <p>I had originally offered to sell up to 51% of the…</p> <p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/2023428274542563508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Shiny Cardboard</h2> <p>A couple of other things of note regarding this peculiar sale. First is to address the grading of this particular card. Of the few dozen Illustrator Pikachu cards that PSA has graded, only one has ever received the gold standard of a 10, with 15 managing a 9 and 12 getting a grade 8. But if you look at Paul’s card, that 10 does feel a little odd. And if you’ve recently tried to get a card graded with the company, you’ll know that something as tiny as an almost invisible print line on the rear of the card is enough to ensure it can’t score a 10. This is a point well addressed by former Blizzard developer <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/2023540758649991373">Adam Fletcher in a post on X</a>, where he explains in detail how standards at PSA have risen over the years, and especially so in the last couple. There’s no way this card would be a 10 if graded today. It makes the whole thing even more of a folly.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seen so much commentary on this thing. Why not chime in? Has some info on grading/comping cards.</p> <p>First, Logan Paul is a sleezebag. Won't get into his fractional share nonsense or all his other past behavior but I feel like this is generally known.</p> <p>As for the card… I've seen… <a href="https://t.co/UuQtcsXwtr">https://t.co/UuQtcsXwtr</a></p> <p>— Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/2023540758649991373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And finally, new owner of the world’s most expensive piece of cardboard AJ Scaramucci has said that it’s his wish for the Illustrator Pikachu to be placed in the recently opened <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-museum-gift-shop-merch-n64-virtual-boy-wii-u-1851657878">Nintendo Museum</a> in Kyoto, Japan, “and cement it as the ‘Mona Lisa’ of the Pokémon Franchise.” It seems incredibly unlikely, though, that Nintendo would want to pay the insurance.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let's get this into the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto and cement it as the "Mona Lisa" of the Pokémon Franchise. <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nintendo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Museum_Nintendo</a> <a href="https://t.co/SPe56Jo6PB">pic.twitter.com/SPe56Jo6PB</a></p> <p>— AJ Scaramucci (@jedimooch) <a href="https://twitter.com/jedimooch/status/2023888485401457021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>World of War Midnight is set for release on Monday, February 2, so the countdown to launch is well and truly on.</strong></p>



<p>Midnight brings the long-awaited arrival of housing to WoW, something players have been clamouring for, and it’s expected to be a busy release period. Naturally, that may come alongside server stress, so prepare yourself for potential problems.</p>

</ul>



<p>WoW has the capacity to deal with the majority of server stress issues, however, so there shouldn’t be too many major problems.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-early-access">When is WoW Midnight Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Early access for World of Warcraft Midnight is set for Thursday, February 26, giving players an extra weekend to dive into all the brand-new content.</strong></p>



<p>Like many other games, however, entry to early access comes at a cost, as it requires an additional purchase. Given the cost of maintaining WoW access, players may want to consider holding out for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-wow-midnight-start-times">What Are The WoW Midnight Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>WoW Midnight is set to be released at 3 PM on March 2, with the early access launch coming four days earlier at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>That means a late afternoon launch for those in the United States, while those in Europe face a late night. Meanwhile, those in Asia and Oceania have to wait until the next day.</p>



<p>The exact release times have been shared by Blizzard and are available in the table below. We’ve separated the main release time and early access into different columns.</p>

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Daedalic+Entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteamDB's stats for Daedalic</a> as a publisher suggests that <em>Across the Unknown</em> hasn't achieved its highest peak concurrent player count on PC yet, although there's plenty of time for it to do so.</p><p>It's certainly Daedalic's most successful PC launch within the last few years, at any rate; the only game to rival it within the last three years is <em>Barotrauma</em>, which achieved a peak player count of just under 20,000 upon its exit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dive-into-europas-depths-in-barotrauma-now-available-in-steam-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc2e1274-bfa3-46d9-823e-918d872ca94f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">from Early Access</a> in March 2023.</p><p>The publisher arguably sorely needs a success like this; while <em>Barotrauma </em>proved a success in 2023, that same year's <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum </em>was so disastrous for Daedalic that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b8cc9b20-8e39-4bf6-a4db-fd132661ca91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">closed down its development division</a> following the game's failure.</p><p>Since then, things haven't exactly been rosy for Daedalic.

<p>Slay The Spire 2 is ready to enter Early Access, just like its predecessor did all those years ago. It’s the perfect time to take on community feedback and balance the various cards and characters, but there’s one thing on everyone’s mind—will the sequel have multiplayer?</p>







<p>It was one of the most requested features for the original Slay The Spire, and for good reason; who wouldn’t want to ascend the Spire with their friends? Well, now’s the time to find out whether Mega Crit took on the fan feedback, and to see whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> will have multiplayer during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-multiplayer">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stand together! Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Slay The Spire 2 will have multiplayer during Early Access, as you and up to three friends can face the Spire together. </strong></p>



<p>This is thanks to the brand new online Co-Op mode, which brings a whole new level of complexity to the game. From multiplayer exclusive cards to powerful team synergies, you and your friends can work together to ascend the Spire and beat the game. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest Indie Games Coming In 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is brand new to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a>, with the original game not having any form of multiplayer or co-op available. Whilst you can still play the game solo, there’s no denying that strategizing with three friends will be a thrill like no other—but can you do it from the same device?</p>







<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-split-screen-co-op">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Helpful notes. Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the moment, it doesn’t seem like Slay The Spire 2 will have split-screen co-op during Early Access. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Crit</a> have only mentioned that the game will have online co-op, and there remains no mention as to whether there will be anything to do with split-screen. However, the likelihood is that whilst it remains in Early Access, co-op features will remain exclusively online.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia? </a></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not to say that it won’t change in the future, though. As the game rolls out on different platforms once Early Access is complete, there’s a chance that local multiplayer features could be added. Until then, though, you’ll have to team up with your friends across different devices. </p>

<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is almost here, but that hasn't stopped evildoers from dropping lots of spoilers all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> director (and famous games industry bad boy) Hideki Kamiya had stronger words for the leakers.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X">his X/Twitter account</a>, the creative commented on the ongoing drama and launched a personal attack against the folks who are ruining other fans' fun before the game hits both the shelves and digital storefronts. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-to-die-ten-thousand-deaths-former-series-director-hideki-kamiya-says-i-pray-they-are-cursed-to-never-play-the-game-again/">GamesRadar+ translated the post</a>, but you can find the original one below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">確かバイオ2の時も終盤の展開を写真週刊誌にスッパ抜かれたよなー…<br>テメエ個人の利己的な満足のために、楽しみにしてるユーザーの気持ちも、力を尽くして制作したクリエイターの気持ちも踏み躙る、全ての人の幸せを破壊する唾棄すべき行為で、万死に値するだろ…二度とゲームを遊べない呪いにかかれ… <a href="https://t.co/iKueo8axFC">https://t.co/iKueo8axFC</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>First, he pointed out RE2 actually went through something similar due to a magazine's poor handling of pre-release leaks: "Towards the end of development on Resident Evil 2, I'm sure there were some leaks that were exposed in a weekly magazine." Mind you, being aware of leaks (and even resharing them) isn't uncommon these days, but things were different back in the day. Still, <em>actual plot spoilers</em>, especially so close to a game's release, are in bad taste in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, the RE Requiem leaks are coming from less official sources and aren't a matter of an outlet slipping up. Thus, cracking down on the leakers is far more difficult. Kamiya said there's almost nothing to gain from leaks that ultimately hurt those who worked hard on the games: "Trampling on the feelings of the people who are looking forward to the game, and the creatives who worked so hard to make it... Destroying everyone's joy, just for these assholes' self-gratification."</p><p>Towards the end of his port, the developer's meaner side reappeared: "Should you commit these contemptible acts, you deserve to die ten thousand deaths," he declared before going with a softer alternative that's just praying "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>It must be noted Kamiya is a much friendlier individual in person, but he's well-known for his harsh attitude online, one which, if you ask me, is often justified based on who/what he often has to deal with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date">What Is The Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you play as? Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-start-times">Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>You’ll want to be up and ready in the morning, as Slay The Spire 2 will be launching in Early Access on Steam at 10 AM PT on March 5.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>

            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space. It was followed by NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and Minecraft. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> dropped from No. 3 to No. 5" but continues to perform strongly after its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch">killer launch</a> back in October.</p><p>Other highlights include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> sneaking into the Top 10 (from way down at No. 255!) after the release of its fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S ports. Shocking few gamers, "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Prime Video's adaptation</a>." Chances are the modern RPG classic will get another boost after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> arrives tomorrow, 24th February.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! It’s time for another Steam Next Fest. A time to stock up on unfinished business. A time to litter your desktop with dead-ends. A time to install 30 game demos and play exactly three of them - unless you are RPS supporter Mr_B, who I think accounts for the majority of Valve’s downloads traffic these days.</p>
<p>We’re not doing the whole Wishlisted thing this year due to a chronic shortage of wishfulness brought on by our collective advancing age, but we’ll be writing up the hottest demos as they arrive, in a dramatic departure from our regular news coverage of… writing up the hottest demos as they arrive. It’s not all demos, mind: a few developers have scandalous plans to unleash <em>complete</em> games into the storm of prototypes and playtests. Here are the ones we’re thinking about feeding to the Maw.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 23rd February</h2>
<ul>
<li>The traditional Xmas party rite of hiding terrible spiders under cups for your mates to find has finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3900650/Spider_Roulette/">been adapted into a videogame</a>, complete with foil packets of power-up cards that don’t, surprisingly, appear to be microtransactions. Genuinely, “pay 50p to skip turn” would be a compelling offer in this context.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 24th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400660/Rise_of_Piracy/">Rise Of Piracy</a> is a MicroProse-published early access RTS in which you take charge of a corsair fleet during the golden age of sailboating. Although you don’t have to be a pirate – the Steam page devotes two whole sections to diplomacy and trading. Rise Of Piracy Alongside Other More Respectable Ventures, then.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2085310/Emberbane/">Emberbane</a> is a 2D metroidvania featuring elemental martial arts. One for the Korra nutters, maybe.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 25th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651600/Reigns_The_Witcher/">Reigns: The Witcher</a> is Nerial’s latest saucy/murderous deckbuilding narrative game, this time set in the CD Projekt fantasy universe. You are legendarily dire bard Dandelion, and you’re trying to sing a song about Geralt in which he does not die for as long as possible.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3074850/Utawarerumono_ZAN_2/">Utawarerumono: ZAN 2</a> is a soft and sleepy-looking anime hack-and-slash that boasts of a base management system and the chance to weaponise *squints* carp?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 26th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458470/Spellcasters_Chronicles/">Spellcasters Chronicles</a> is a 3v3 wizard MOBA from Quantic Dream. Press X to jungle?</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2331020/Tales_of_Berseria_Remastered/">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a> is Bamco’s latest revamp for one of their generally quite decent action-RPGs.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4138430/Sngri_Pinball/">Snägäri Pinball</a> is a celebration of “Finland’s legendary late-night snack kiosks where neon lights, grease, and glory meet under the silver ball”. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 27th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3764200/Resident_Evil_Requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is Capcom’s latest helping of undead frightfulness. They’ve cut the action-horror label in twain for this one: you’ll alternate between massacring zombies in third-person as Leon Kennedy, and hiding from them in first-person (by default, anyway) as new character Grace Ashcroft.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3872770/ARROW_WORLD/">Arrow World</a> is conveyor belt sokoban. It burns! It burns!</li>
</ul>
<p>RPS staff activities this week? Well, a lot of us are playing Requiem. I have already gotten as far as the bit with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">the ghastly girlboss</a> from the SGF demo. Callum and Jeremy are much further along and are expressing strong opinions about things that are under embargo. James also has a code. Pour one out for Mark, sitting glazed on the periphery of all this, trying to write about a game that involves rats. What are you up to this week?</p>
