            <p>Mock reviews are a widespread practice within the games industry, yet due to the secretive nature of the work involved, they remain an under-discussed branch of the feedback process – particularly in comparison to fields such as QA and player testing. With most mock reviews and game evaluations written under heavy NDA, it's perhaps unsurprising that we hear little about this line of work.</p>
<p>With the help of experts in publishing, PR and game consultancy – combined with my own knowledge as a freelance consultant and mock reviewer – this article aims to demystify the mock review process, and explore how game evaluations provide a useful form of feedback at different stages of the development process.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">What is a mock review?</h2>
<p>In its most basic form, a mock review resembles the sort of review you would see published by games media. It's a written essay that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of a game, intended to mirror the external critique that a game would face at launch. Mock reviews are typically commissioned by publishers or marketing agencies, and often written by people with a background in games journalism.</p>
<p>"The idea is that publishers really want to gauge the potential success of their title and what a critical landscape will look like," says Sterling McGarvey, head of consulting at game consultancy firm Hit Detection. "Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews."</p>
<blockquote>"Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>Alongside a written article, clients will ask mock reviewers to provide a score, or an estimate of how the game would rank on Metacritic. McGarvey notes that publishers now increasingly value community sentiment as a way of gauging a game's success at launch, but as a forecasting metric, "Metacritic is easier and neater for all parties involved."</p>
<p>Depending on the project, reviewers could be required to give a general overview of their impressions of a game – as if they were publishing a real review – or be asked to focus their feedback on specific areas. This could be something such as a potential sensitivity issue, the game's narrative, or a particular set of mechanics.</p>
<p>"We pull together key messaging points when we're starting a campaign… and a lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across," says Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage. "If something we really want to lead on is gunplay mechanics, we will focus a lot more on 'How do you find the gunplay mechanics, and what kind of things would you recommend in terms of players creating their build-outs?'"</p>
<h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Mock reviews, game evaluations, and when they happen in development</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p>Although often used interchangeably, the terms 'mock review' and 'game evaluation' describe two slightly different forms of feedback. A mock review is typically a straightforward written review with a score.</p>
<p>"I have done only one pure mock review thus far in my career as a consultant," says PR consultant at Future Friends Games Natalie Flores, who has also conducted game evaluations for consultancy firms Magid and Hit Detection. "I've mostly done large reports spanning over 30 pages, amassed over the course of multiple surveys, roundtables, and many hours of writing; mock reviews have been a very small part of them."</p>
<p>These larger reports – in which mock reviews form only one section – are often termed evaluations. These can contain varying forms of feedback, such as breakout paragraphs or questionnaire results. The other key difference between mock reviews and game evaluations is when they take place during the development process.</p>
<p>"The term mock review is used as a blanket term," says McGarvey. "I look at a mock review as something that comes late in the development process, where perhaps there's not necessarily room to make changes, whereas a game evaluation can come at any stage of the development process. If [Hit Detection] were to evaluate a game, we can look at something as early as concept and provide some feedback just based on the collective expertise of the team. We look at what the landscape [might] look like a couple of years down the line and extrapolate.</p>
<blockquote>"A lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Other times, we will look at something that's just barely playable, alongside design documents and supporting materials… The idea being that we would look at the vision of the game, what we're playing, the scope of it, the development time they have remaining – and think 'If you're able to hit these elements of your vision, this is where we see you potentially landing with this'. It's just based on when the client feels it's appropriate, and they want to get some feedback on their game."</p>
<p>Though it may sound counterintuitive to commission a mock review close to release – when further changes cannot be made – these late-stage reviews still have their uses.</p>
<p>"There's two things that we're trying to do here: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from," says Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are. "Also, you can use them to manage client expectations."</p>
<p>So in essence, mock reviews provide a final heads-up on what critics will say about a game upon release – allowing for last-minute changes to marketing campaigns – and give publishers and PR agencies the opportunity to manage internal expectations of how a game will perform.</p>
<p>Mock reviews can be carried out internally: sometimes by a publisher's communications department, or even a dedicated in-house evaluations team. Yet alongside these internal reviews, publishers will often look to consultancies or freelance consultants to gain an outside perspective.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Not just for big publishers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Mock reviews and game evaluations can be commissioned by clients of all sizes. McGarvey says that while his work at Hit Detection used to be "heavily AAA," the consultancy has now evolved to "occupy a variety of niches," also including smaller budget AA titles ("your $30 games," he says) as well as indies.</p>
<blockquote>"There's two things that we're trying to do: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from"<cite>Lewis Denby</cite></blockquote>
<p>Denby says that for smaller teams, commissioning feedback is a matter of finding "the most valuable thing you can spend your limited budget on to help drive you towards success."</p>
<p>Commissioning a lengthy report might not be a sensible way to spend this budget, but asking evaluators to write about first impressions can be more helpful. This could involve giving the evaluators a trailer, media pack, screenshots, and asking them to play a 30-minute build.</p>
<p>"That can be so informative for indie developers, because a lot of the time these are things that they're so close to, they haven't realised that in the first five minutes of their game, there's a giant difficulty spike right off the bat," says Denby. "Or there might be something about the way they're talking about the game, or presenting the game, that's stopping people from even wanting to load up the demo in the first place. And that's often the biggest hurdle for small studios and solo devs – just getting that foot in the door."</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Why are mock reviews and game evaluations useful?</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, publishers typically commission mock reviews to gain an understanding of the critical reception a game will receive upon release, while evaluations highlight problem areas that can be addressed before launch. Developers can also become very close to their projects, sometimes making it difficult for them to impartially critique their own work. In these cases, mock reviews and evaluations are able to provide a more 'detached' form of feedback.</p>
<p>"It's very easy to not be able to see the wood from the trees, because you're in it every day," explains Denby. "We sometimes speak to indie developers who say 'We're really confident that we know how people respond to this game because we've taken it to shows and got feedback from people playing it.' And what I always say to that is… people don't want to be mean to your face. And actually, the feedback that's really valuable is that from people who you don't know, and have no vested interest whatsoever in your feelings."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Rebecca-Attard.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Evaluators can also provide guidance on how to present games to the media at launch. Attard explains that Splash Damage often equips mock reviewers with guides and documentation of the sort that would be given to critics upon release. Mock reviewers can give feedback on these guides, identifying places where journalists and influencers could potentially become confused.</p>
<p>"I've also used mock reviewers early in the cycle when we're doing things like events, or a big press beat, to look at the demo we're putting out and look at the presentation around it to ensure that the way we're talking about this game – based on what they're playing, and what we're saying – is really clear," Attard adds.</p>
<p>Developers are often aware of the problem areas within their own games, but may need further evidence to back up any proposed changes. For this reason, game evaluations can be useful for internal politicking.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, a developer will ask for something from the higher-ups and be unable to get that thing – say, for example, budget for a particular feature or segment that they know will improve the game," says Flores. "A developer can consult outside experts like mock reviewers to see if the experts will agree with them… The developer can then take the expert evaluation to the higher-up, as they will now have a stronger argument they can present when asking for what they need."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The difference in feedback compared to QA and playtests</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Developers receive feedback on their games from a variety of sources: QA, consumer playtests, and influencer playtests being just some examples. All of these forms of feedback are valuable, and in addition to these, game evaluators can bring a different perspective to the table.</p>
<p>"When you want to bring in game evaluators, you're looking for a perspective that understands media, that understands consumers and community to some degree," McGarvey explains. "It's on-the-job training that you bring, there's a certain degree of intangibles from your experience reviewing games."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Lewis-Denby_LZzdmkX.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared to QA testers – who do invaluable work highlighting specific bugs and technical problems – the job of a mock reviewer is more about critical analysis.</p>
<p>"What we're really trying to understand from a mock review is – what is going to be the reaction of the media when they play this?" Denby says. "What sort of emotions or thoughts or feelings does it conjure up? What sort of likelihood of coverage is there? All these sorts of things can be really relevant."</p>
<p>Attard notes that mock reviewers will often look at games in a more "impartial" way than consumers do in playtests.</p>
<p>"Users tend to get hooked up on little niggles that they might not necessarily like. Whereas a mock reviewer can give us a much broader view of everything, and in a much more considered way, written up into a report that isn't just raw feedback."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The importance of using a wide range of reviewers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>In most cases, publishers will commission mock reviews from several critics at once. There can also be several rounds of mock reviews or evaluations on a single project, taking place at different stages of the development process.</p>
<blockquote>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is to gather a broad range of perspectives. Attard gives the example of a strategy game: for this, she would likely bring in an experienced strategy gamer, alongside a reviewer who's more of a generalist, in order to gain two different perspectives on the game. She adds that Splash Damage typically brings in both English language speakers and non-English language speakers, as this gives an understanding of different markets.</p>
<p>"We tend to do at least four different mock reviews from different markets and different individual journalists, because it is so important to not just focus on one."</p>
<p>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well," she adds. "It's also a generational thing – there's certain things that the older generation might look for that the younger generation don't, and that gives you a fresh take on it with the younger generation."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">How do I become a mock reviewer or game evaluator?</h2>
<p>Most mock reviewers have a background in games journalism, and transition to evaluation work once they have significant experience writing reviews. The first step towards becoming a game evaluator, therefore, is to build up a portfolio of work that shows you can critically analyse a game and clearly explain your thoughts.</p>
<p>"I would recommend honing your criticism skills," says Flores. "Write your thoughts down after you finish a game, make a coherent argument about your perspective. Know how to relay this verbally, too – you'll be doing plenty of talking and responding to questions from the developer with the more involved mock review assignments out there."</p>
<blockquote>"Networking is, at its best, genuine relationship building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on"<cite>Natalie Flores</cite></blockquote>
<p>Writing reviews for your own blog is a useful way to refine your skills and demonstrate an interest in games journalism but, as Denby notes, you will likely need experience writing for professional outlets before you can take on mock review work.</p>
<p>"We need to see that you have gone through that process – working under an editor, having professionally published content – because we need to understand that you have created content of the sort that we want to understand."</p>
<p>Alongside gaining experience as a professional reviewer, it's useful to build up your knowledge of the game development process. It's important that you are able to look past bugs to understand the developer's vision. Equally, when evaluating a game later in the development process, your suggestions need to be realistic for the project's remaining development timeframe.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Be a generalist, but have a speciality</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Although it sounds paradoxical, being a mock reviewer requires both a general understanding of the gaming landscape, and the ability to specialise. A broad knowledge of gaming news, industry trends, and community sentiment is useful when giving feedback to clients, allowing you to highlight potential marketing opportunities or risks. Being a generalist also allows you to work on a wide range of projects. Yet it's also helpful to be known as an expert in a couple of areas. Evaluating a game in a genre you know well will allow you to make comparisons to similar games in the market, providing clients with useful context.</p>

<p>If there is a specific game design element that you are particularly good at analysing – such as UI/UX design or onboarding – you can also make this your niche. Publishers may seek you out if you are known to be an expert in a specific genre, or if you can provide useful insights into a particular aspect of a game's design.</p>
<p>"If you've got a niche that's outside of the usual 'this game is good or bad,' take that and make it your superpower," advises McGarvey.</p>
<p>Some evaluators specialise in identifying best practices in areas such as accessibility, or diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>"Accessibility is an area where there's a lot of people doing great advocacy and consultancy work," adds McGarvey. "The work that those organisations are doing helps everybody as a whole… A rising tide raises all ships, and these advancements, in my opinion, are making games better."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Promote yourself, and get networking</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Attracting mock review work is also a matter of making yourself visible, and building a reputation for producing high-quality reviews. As a journalist, you may well have a platform on social media, so it's worth leveraging this to display your work. A portfolio website allows publishers to check your past reviews, and see if you would be a good match for their project.</p>
<blockquote>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>PR firms and consulting agencies often do outreach to reviewers to ask for their help with mock reviews. Equally, you can be proactive by emailing PR agencies, and letting them know that you're available for work. Over time, opportunities may come your way through word-of-mouth recommendations, and through networking.</p>
<p>"Networking is, at its best, just genuine relationship-building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on," says Flores. "Just be polite and kind; have some convictions and don't be afraid to voice them constructively on social media… and become someone known for being reliable and doing good work."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>What makes a good mock reviewer or evaluator?</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, a good evaluator is able to look at an early game build and give useful feedback without being distracted by bugs which are likely to be fixed during the development process. Giving feedback on a game's flow or difficulty curve will be useful for developers; spending three paragraphs describing a bug is unlikely to be helpful.</p>
<p>An ability to detach yourself from your personal tastes and present a wider view of the critical landscape can also be beneficial. McGarvey describes this as the ability to externalise.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component," he adds.</p>
<p>Denby mentions that it's helpful when evaluators simply write a review as they would for a publication, rather than trying to pre-empt what the developers might be looking for: "Just review it, imagine that this is what you were putting out there into the world, because that is ultimately what we're trying to gauge when we distribute this code – what's likely to happen."</p>
<p>Finally, for Attard, one of the most important qualities an evaluator can have is the ability to communicate effectively and forge positive working relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>"Some [evaluators] come back with things that aren't necessarily that positive, and [publishers] have to be able to accept what they're saying and not get frustrated or annoyed at them," Attard says. "That's where having a good relationship – where someone is able to really communicate with you about the process, or the reasons why they're saying these things – is key."</p>

        <p>Employees have shared news of closure on social media</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has reportedly closed Timbre Games.</p>
<p>This follows an announcement yesterday that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-to-reduce-staff-by-up-to-15">Sumo would be reducing staff by 15%</a>, putting nearly 250 employees at risk of redundancy.</p>
<p>The closure wasn't included in the announcement, but employees shared news of the studio's shut down on social media.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we learned today that Timbre Games is closing and our entire studio's team of exceptionally talented and wonderful people will no longer be employed," recruitment coordinator Jenna Dore shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206352897406607360/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>"It has been a true blessing to work at Timbre, and I am so thankful to have gained such valuable experience and met all of the incredible humans I have come to know and love every day at work."</p>
<p>Technical director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206334477617274880/">Campbell Dixon</a> added: "It's been an incredible journey over the past three years, starting this studio from nothing and growing to a team of almost 100 people. I'm heartbroken and so disappointed that we won't be able to finish our game or show anyone the amazing work that we did."</p>
<p>Based in Vancouver, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-opens-second-studio-in-canada">Timbre Games opened in 2021</a> as part of Pipework Studios, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-acquires-pipeworks-for-usd100m">Sumo acquired for $100 million in September 2020</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At the time of writing, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>‘s long awaited DLC expansion, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em>, will be launching in just over a week on June 21. In case you weren’t aware, though, you can’t jump straight into it unless you’ve at least managed to defeat two of the base game’s optional boss fights; a feat a significant number of players still haven’t done.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">During a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202402/22335199.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Famitsu</a> this past February, <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that, in order to access the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and its new area, the Realm of Shadow, you need to have already killed Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. Sounds simple enough, but everyone knows that <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s boss fights are anything but simple or easy to beat. What’s more, you could very easily miss Mohg during your own playthrough, so be sure to read our guide on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-in-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find and beat Mohg</a> in case you haven’t done so already.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Don’t feel bad if you haven’t; a lot of other <em>Elden Ring</em> players still haven’t beaten Mohg either. On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch streamer Cohh Carnage</a> revealed that, on Steam, only 37.8% of players had acquired the Shardbearer Mohg achievement you get for killing Mohg. This prompted publisher Bandai Namco to <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet out a warning/reminder</a> on June 11 and, since then, the number’s only gone up to 38.7% according to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1245620/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam stats</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Things look a bit better on PlayStation and Xbox. According to tracking sites <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Elden-Ring/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a354491/shardbearer-mohg-achievement">TrueAchievements</a>, 65% of PlayStation players and 54% of Xbox players have claimed the Shardbearer Mohg trophy/achievement, but this still leaves a lot of players that won’t be able to play the DLC. Looking at the stats, there are also plenty of people that haven’t even defeated Radahn yet. At the time of writing, 54.5% of Steam players, 77% of PlayStation players, and 70% of Xbox players have received the Shardbearer Radahn achievement for beating him.</p>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="false">It’s likely that a portion of those players simply dropped off <em>Elden Ring</em> sometime after buying it, and may have no intention of returning to the game. Fortunately, for those who do want to play the DLC and haven’t got round to defeating Radahn and/or Mohg, the <em>Elden Ring</em> community is full of people willing to share advice. Plus, the game has a summon mechanic that lets you call on other players for aid during fights, so be sure to take advantage of that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demon%E2%80%99s-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works.898857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/demons-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are a lot of deckbuilding roguelikes out there, and there are also a fair few match-3 games out there, but to my knowledge, Demon’s Mirror is the only game that combines all of these ideas into one. It’s a fairly strange genre mashup, and one that I initially struggled to wrap my head around, but once it clicked, it all made sense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon's Mirror - Next Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqOYLReTfT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basically, you’ve got a character who has various cards they can use. Some of these will impact the enemies, some will impact you, and some will impact the board. You have to balance spending your available energy on cards and on matching things on the board. Every chain you create on the board costs one mana more than the one before, and then resets on the next turn. So, if you want to destroy an attach an enemy has placed on the board, you’ll need to keep that in mind.</p>


<p>As you chain things together on theboard, you can also reduce the cost of cards in your hands with the right passives, which will allow you to essentially cheat cards out for free if you play your, well, cards right. It’s a good mix of the two systems, and it does work pretty well for the most part. It’s hard to escape that feeling of “these two things shouldn’t be together,” but ultimately, Demon’s Mirror is a fair amount of fun to play.</p>


<p>Previewing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1600910/Demons_Mirror/">the Steam Next Fest demo</a> ahead of time, I could only access a small portion of what the game will offer, so I can’t speak for how powerful your builds can feel as you progress through different levels, but there are plenty of hints for how strong you can make yourself if you’re a good mix of lucky and smart. Even with only the first level to experiment with, I still found a few different playstyles to try out. There are also meant to be other characters as well, so that’s something to look forward to if this concept sinks its claws in.</p>
<p>Movement is your standard Slay the Spire affair, so you finish a battle, choose the next room, and so on. It’s a tried and tested method, and the only issue with it is that it feels so familiar when you’ve got a battle system that’s so unique. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, I just feel like we could have had something else in its stead, and Demon’s Mirror would stand out even more from the crowd.</p>

<p>Actually, I did have one other issue with it, and that’s that I wanted to keep playing! I don’t like repeating the same first level again and again, even though it changes between runs. I want to see how far a build can take me and explore the meta progression a bit more. That being said, when the biggest issue with a game preview is that you want to play more of it, it’s pretty clear that something special is going on. I’m very keen to see how Demon’s Mirror progresses, and you can try it out yourself now thanks to Steam Next Fest.</p>

            <p>US labour union the CWA (Communications Workers of America) have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge">filed Unfair Labor Practice</a> charges against Activision QA supplier Lionbridge Technologies. As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cwa-accuses-activision-qa-supplier-lionbridge-of-retaliatory-layoffs">Game Developer</a> reports, the CWA allege that Lionbridge fired an entire 160-person team in Idaho in retaliation for union-related activities.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The CWA accuse Lionbridge, who also subcontract labour to Activision owner Microsoft, of making the layoffs "in retaliation for workers engaging in protected organizing activities and protected speech when raising issues regarding their working conditions."</p>
<p>It’s also alleged that, following the firings, Lionbridge offered severance that required the laid-off employees to "agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act." As the CWA point out, the US National Labor Relations Board has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring">ruled this practise to be unlawful</a>.</p>
<p>The laid-off workers were told that their termination occurred because the project they were working on had ended. Despite this, other teams in Mexico and Poland continue to work on the same project.  The CWA point out that Lionbridge has what they call a "documented union-busting track record." In 2016, Lionbridge <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/">laid of all 16 of its unionised employees</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/CWAUnion/status/1800537113831858437">Posting on X</a>, the CWA quoted former Lionbridge Test Associate Al Bussabarger. "We do much the same work that union-represented Activision QA employees do," reads the quote. "Microsoft should make sure that everyone working on its games is treated with respect in line with its labor principles, including employees of contractors." This post was to add additional context to the original CWA post on the filing against Lionbridge, made by the CODE-CWA, a "Tech, Games, and Digital Industries" group with support from the CWA.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the CODE-CWA <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1696518155336593704">announced</a> that there were more than 4,000 tech, game &amp; digital worker members in the CWA. We’ve seen an uptick in staff from large companies forming and voting in favour of unions in the past few years, notably in areas related to QA, including those at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-staff-form-union-after-layoffs-and-want-everybody-in-the-industry-to-join">CD Projekt</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-qa-contractors-vote-unanimously-to-unionise">Bioware Edmonton</a>,<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-albany-qa-testers-vote-unanimously-in-favour-of-unionising"> Blizzard Albany</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">Zenimax</a>. </p>
<p>The Blizzard Albany workers, notably, faced pushback from Activision, which was shot down<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-appeal-against-blizzard-albany-qa-union-vote-rejected"> by the NLRB</a>. The CWA themselves filed an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-hit-with-another-unfair-labour-charge-from-cwa">unfair labour charge against Activision Blizzard</a> in October, 2022. In March of this year, staff at Sega Of America <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-of-america-staff-have-ratified-a-union-contract-the-first-to-do-so-at-a-major-us-studio">became the first such group to ratify a union contract</a> at a major US studio.</p>

        <p>"We're not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast," co-founders say</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Armello developer League of Geeks has announced that it's going on a hiatus for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">blog post</a> penned by Ty Carey, Trent Kusters, and Blake Mizzi, the co-founders announced that the team is going to take "extended time off" and that they're not sure "when (or if) [they] will resurrect this great beast," due to the current economic difficulties in the industry.</p>
<p>Solium Infernum, which released in February to critical acclaim, will continue to be supported with bug fixes and minor content updates, but "its sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC," they added.</p>
<p>Jumplight Odyssey, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-well-fight-till-the-last-breath">had been put on hold indefinitely in December</a> a few months after its Early Access release, will not go back into active development but will still get a full release within the next year.</p>
<p>"Jumplight Odyssey has, as of this point, not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development on the title," the post read. "We would love nothing more than to see this project finished, but unfortunately, development will remain on hiatus.</p>
<p>"We are aiming to bring it out of Early Access at some point in the next 12 months. This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned, though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources."</p>
<p>Armello will continue to be online as well, with plans for the Armello board game unaffected by the changes as it's being handled by King of the Castle Games.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months," the co-founders said.</p>
<p>They added: "Makin' <em>[sic]</em> video games is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years, but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."</p>
<p>We talked to Kusters in December as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-well-fight-till-the-last-breath">League of Geeks cut off 50% of its workforce after an investment fell through</a>. We had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-its-a-very-serious-time-for-a-studio-of-our-size">talked to the co-founder a couple of months before the news as well</a>, at the time highlighting just how much of a difficult time it was for large indie developers, due to lack of funding.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/handmancers-is-the-first-fps-roguelite-deckbuilder-and-its-cute/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Trailers, trailers, trailers. I know it’s been a long week for people that like to know what games are coming out in the next two years, but bear with me. I’ve got one more for you to watch, and it’s a good one! Handmancers is a roguelite deckbuilder, which isn’t all that unusual at this point, but this one does two things that make it stand out: first, it’s from a first-person perspective, so you can look your deckbuilding foes in the eye(s), and secondly, it looks absolutely lovely. This is a good thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Handmancer Announcement Trailer - Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXhZ9T428so?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from developer 58Blades, and published by Skystone Games, Handmancers plays on the fact that you’re using your hands to cast cards and spells, and that you can see them. You’ve got to craft your deck, level up your cards, and think about the strategy you’re going to employ to take down your enemies. There’s also powerful artefacts to equip – I’m guessing that these will grant you particular boons, or special attacks – so you’ll really have to think about your loadout and how your playstyle, deck and artefacts work together. There’s a trio of card types: Parchment, Stone and Blades, and I’m thinking that they’ll function like Fire Emblems weapon triangle. I could, of course, be entirely wrong. I’m more certain that being a roguelite, you can probably expect to lose fairly regularly too. It sounds great, and if you’re a fan of strategising and planning out your tactics then Handmancers could be a winner.</p>

<p>It also looks absolutely fantastic. The enemies and central characters look characterful and memorable, and there’s a vibrant, cartoonish strand to the art design. If the tactical gameplay stands up to the delightful visuals we’re going to be in for a treat.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like the perfect mix, 58Blades have released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2423290/Handmancers/">a brand new demo</a> for you get a flavour of it all for yourself.</p>

<p><em>“We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog.”</em></p>
<p>[<strong>Original story</strong>] A major Epic leak might hint at plenty of unannounced games coming to the Epic Games Store, including titles from major publishers.</p>
<p>Remember the NVIDIA GeForce Now leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from some years ago</a>? Numerous high-profile titles were included in that leak, including former exclusives from Nintendo, Microsoft, and Nintendo. Fast forward three years, and we might now have another massive leak via EpicDB - a database project for the Epic Games Store. Interestingly enough, the host <a href="https://epicdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the database now appears to be down, and the page can't be accessed</a>. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user 'MondoMega' yesterday, the database apparently included plenty of details from yet-to-be-published games from a variety of publishers, including major ones such as Bethesda, Sega, Square Enix, Rockstar, but also PlayStation and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Although the NVIDIA GeForce Now leak included actual titles, this new leak includes mostly codenames for upcoming games. As such, it's quite hard to link a particular codename to a specified game, but on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/?share_id=6m1QV-LYimeoJ1TcX40o5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, several users have gone a long way to try and find matches for the codenames. Notable titles on the recently updated list include The Last of Us Part II, as well as BioShock 4, possibly an Uncharted title, Red Dead Redemption 1, Rise of the Ronin (could also be Ghost of Tsushima), and many more. It should be noted, that the leak also includes now-cancelled games. Still, it's an interesting find, and we're pretty sure that it will be worth the read. We've included a part of the list below:</p>
<p><em><strong>SIE:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kondo (likely Rise of the Ronin, thanks Andybabez20. Could also be Ghost of Tsushima as multiple people mentioned!)</em></li>
<li><em>Carrack (this one is pretty interesting, a Carrack is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">14th century sailing ship</a>. So I'm not sure what this could be. Maybe a Sea of Thieves like game?&nbsp;<strong>Edit: Could also be Uncharted, thank you 7373838jdjd</strong>)</em></li>
<li><em>Utah (This is the Last of Us Part 2, thank you AdFit6788)</em></li>
<li><em>RhodeIsland</em></li>

<p><em><strong>SEGA:</strong></em></p>

<p>SteamDB is a hugely valuable resource that anyone in the industry frequently leans on to ascertain player numbers, performance charts, price history, and much more. It’s a treasure trove of data that has been plugged into Steam’s APIs for years, picking up every tidbit and statistic that emerges from the relatively transparent platform.</p>



<p>Recently – and quite suddenly – EpicDB launched, bringing about a similar service for the Epic Games Store, one of Steam’s leading competitors on PC. However, as soon as the product hit the internet, countless details about unreleased games, unpublished DLCs, and upcoming projects were revealed through the APIs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mega-leak-time">Mega Leak Time</h2>



<p>In a monumental data repository, users are discovering that the EpicDB platform is giving away a little more than intended. Every item listed on the Epic Games Store has a space, and that space houses information about a title such as its performance on the platform, when it was first created as an item in the table, and when it was last updated – and with what.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Epic Games, the service – which is operated by a third party – seems to be giving away more than intended. For instance, it has revealed references to The Last of Us Part II on PC, a Turok title from Saber Interactive, DLC for the unreleased Sonic x Shadow Generations, and a bunch of lines referring to the Final Fantasy IX Remake. For instance, nestled within the latter item are data points referring to a ‘Deluxe Upgrade’, some pre-order bonuses, and a series of game versions used for testing and debugging.</p>



<p>Most of the juicy content is hidden somewhat behind codenames, but there’s a lot that can be easily decoded. Some users have uncovered references to Morrowind (whatever that might mean), and there’s even a nod to ‘Bloodborne Remake’, but many have surmised that it’s a fake listing. </p>



<p>Sadly, it’s impossible to discover more at the time of writing <a href="https://epicdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as the website</a> has been taken down and trying to access it yields little more than an error page. Only time will tell if it comes back up.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review.898836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Standalone in the dark.</h2></div><div><section><p>There certainly weren’t many flaws to shine a shaky flashlight beam on in Alan Wake II, but one thing I did lament in 2023’s excellent survival horror sequel was the total absence of Night Springs episodes on the in-game televisions. These quirky, Twilight Zone-inspired tales were a consistent joy to discover in Alan Wake’s original 2010 adventure, so to find them seemingly off the air as though they were the casualties of some sort of in-game writers’ strike was a touch disappointing. The good news is that the series has returned in a now fully-playable form thanks to the Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC, which serves up three standalone stories that take us back to the small town of Bright Falls and beyond. They’re admittedly a little on the short side since I was able to knock all three episodes over in a single two-hour sitting, but I certainly had a blast with these twisted new nightmares while they lasted.</p><p>Night Springs’ first episode, Number One Fan, is definitely both the goofiest and goriest in the collection, allowing us to play as obsessive Alan Wake fan Rose Marigold as she waits tables in Bright Falls’ Oh Deer Diner. This action-heavy installment begins with Rose topping up coffee cups and clearing away pie crumb-covered plates, but she’s soon compelled to blaze a trail through a bloodthirsty mob after she’s sent an SOS from Alan Wake himself, who’s apparently been kidnapped. How does she receive this request for help? Via an unexpected transmission through the puckered maw of one of those wall-mounted Big Mouth Billy Bass singing fishes that thousands of disappointed dads unwrapped on Fathers Day in the year 2000. Yep, things in Night Springs are enjoyably off-kilter almost from the very outset.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC Review screens</h3></div></output><p>Number One Fan completely strips the survival component out of Alan Wake II by strapping a fully automatic shotgun to Rose’s shoulder and lining the pockets of her apron with an almost limitless supply of shells. The whole episode takes place during the magic hour shortly before sunset so none of the enemies are cloaked in shadowy shields, and therefore there’s no need to burn the darkness away with a battery-hungry flashlight before you can dispatch them. Instead, the combat in Number One Fan swaps the series’ signature light-based fights for more high tempo running and gunning. Although its crunchy gunplay may be more straightforward, it still manages to be an ultra violent delight thanks to the campy ‘50s rock music that propels it and the cutesy quips that Rose spouts with each axe-wielding maniac she mulches – like she’s a pump-action-toting Princess Peach. Night Springs’ first episode kicks the collection off with a concussive sequence of skull-shattering bangs in Rose’s relentlessly entertaining and revved up rescue mission.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Night Springs’ first episode kicks the collection off with a concussive sequence of skull-shattering bangs.</p></div><h2>Guest Side Story  </h2><p>The second episode, North Star, slows the pace down considerably as you plunge into the inkiest depths of darkness you’d expect from an Alan Wake adventure. I was initially thrilled to step back into the shoes of Jesse Faden from Control here, however my enthusiasm took a bit of a hit when I realised that she hadn’t brought her amazing shape-shifting gun and spectacular suite of superpowers from the 2019 action epic along with her. Still, this midnight stalk through the creepy Coffee World theme park featured in Alan Wake II’s main campaign successfully ratchets up the tension after the comparatively carefree murder spree of the previous episode, arming Jesse with a flashlight and regular, non-transforming pistol as she is pit against the same spooky silhouettes that had me nervously shooting at shadows in last year’s game.</p><p>North Star is also the more puzzle-oriented of the episodes featured here, and I enjoyed cracking keypad codes and manipulating the mechanical controls of a ferris wheel during this brief investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Jesse’s brother. Still, I can’t help but feel that of the three episodes included in Night Springs, this second one is the least remarkable. It fails to leverage the jaw-dropping skill set of its guest star, and a lot of what transpires in it feels like well-made but fairly standard survival horror fare. This whole second episode effectively went down like a hot beverage from the Coffee World concession stand – stimulating enough, but it also left me with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.</p><h2>Serling Silver</h2><p>Thankfully, Night Springs’ third and final episode, Time Breaker, is the best and boldest of the bunch and rounds out this collection in the most mind-bendingly meta way possible. Here we’re cast as the real-world actor Shawn Ashmore, who we find reprising his role as Sheriff Breaker from Alan Wake II in a brand new game being directed by developer Remedy Entertainment’s creative director, Sam Lake. During a break in production and after a hilarious moment with Lake giving an extremely self-aware and exhaustingly acronym-heavy explanation of his new game’s plot, Ashmore is blinked into another time and space by Night Springs’ Rod Serling stand-in and multiversal maestro, Mr. Door.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What follows is a surreal string of sequences through ominous forest paths and disorientating hotel corridor loops, psychedelically shifting from the monochrome presentation of early television to the vivid colours of comic book paneling that seem to intentionally mirror Remedy’s past work on the Max Payne series. To say anything more would be to spoil too much, but there are some excellent story surprises and left-turn level designs to be found here that rival the most outside-of-the-box moments from the main Alan Wake II campaign, and it meant that Night Springs finished on a thoroughly hypnotic high note that left me wanting more.     </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Alan Wake II: Night Springs is a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy’s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore. There’s admittedly not much new here from a gameplay perspective, and it feels like a bit of a tease to play as a version of Control’s heroine stripped of her special abilities in the second episode. Even so, the highs I felt during my short return to Alan Wake’s universe greatly outweighed the lows, and I’d gladly play through another collection of bite-sized side stories if Remedy ever decided to bake another batch. Could there be more Night Springs in the future? Hope springs eternal. </p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC Review</h3><div><p>great</p><p>Alan Wake II: Night Springs veers from ultra violence to tense survival horror, before settling into the multiversal madness of the series at its best.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au" title="Tristan Ogilvie"><span></span><figcaption><p>Tristan Ogilvie</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="hMcu2l"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>’s third episode brought up a whole lot more <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">questions than it answered</a>. For instance: What’s up with that Force Cult, how were Mae and Osha born, why are the Jedi here to begin with, why is the dialogue so bad, and what actually happened in that fire? But the most important question of all is: How in the hell did all that stone catch on fire?</p>
<p id="z5CjnH">Of course, Star Wars is a series full of deep and complex lore, so here are our best attempts to explain exactly how a mountain caught on fire in <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p>
<p id="5ga5CJ">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em> episode 3.]</p>
<p id="r4iZHi">Before we get into explanations, it’s important that we go over the event in question a little bit first. The fire in the mountain on Brendok is the inciting incident for everything else that happens in <em>The Acolyte.</em> It’s what separates Mae and Osha, and what gives both of them their diametrically opposed views on the Jedi. So when we got the flashback in episode 3, it initially seemed like it might be a complex event, rife with childhood misunderstandings and missed perspective. Maybe from what Osha saw it seemed like Mae created the fire, while Mae saw that it was some kind of Jedi accident, leading to her hatred. </p>
<p id="uR4Sfu">Unfortunately, none of this is what actually happens in the episode. Instead, we see kid Mae clearly and emotionlessly say that she would rather kill her sister herself than see her leave, then set the entire mountain temple on fire. While the events that led up to the fire are a pretty extreme disappointment — even if the show could just be using this inexplicable child murderer plot as a smokescreen for a later surprise — it’s still somehow the fire itself that seems silliest. Mae takes Osha’s sketchbook, lights up its pages using a lamp, and then throws it into the stone hallway... which promptly ignites like it’s made of dry wood. Here’s where we have to meet the show way more than halfway. </p>
<h2 id="kyK8UL"><strong>Theory 1: The alternate-material theory </strong></h2>
<p id="CNmZJy">Perhaps what looked like stone inside the mountain was actually a different material? While most of the temple we see on Brendok in <em>The Acolyte</em>’s third episode appears to be carved straight into the mountain, maybe the coven of witches actually coated the interior tunnels of their home with some extremely flammable, non-rock material. </p>

</p>
<p id="MmrFC2">This is the silliest and most cop-out theory possible, but is also a little bit of an old-school Star Wars explanation too. Just like setting fires in space or the scream of TIE fighters, it’s something silly and fun that defies all explanations of Earthly science, and that’s fine. Of course, this would be a little easier to stomach if <em>The Acolyte</em> were taking itself a little less seriously, and if the fire in question didn’t leave so many of the people involved paralyzed with guilt, full of regret, dead-set on vengeance, or simply dead altogether. Silly problems are great to meet with silly answers, but tragedies deserve something a little more thought-out.  </p>
<h2 id="wBzCL8"><strong>Theory 2: The hidden-culprit theory </strong></h2>
<p id="BFVjCM">This theory revolves around the idea that what we saw in episode 3 was only part of the story. Sure, Mae made a childish, rash assertion that she wanted to kill her sister, but her sketchbook fire should have simply fizzled out, except that another perpetrator used the Force to spread the flames. </p>
<p id="bZ7f2S">The most-likely outcome of a theory like this would be that someone from Mae and Osha’s coven fanned the flames to try to get the girls out and blame the Jedi. The culprit here, probably, would be the Zabrak witch who seemed to be having a bit of a power struggle with the twins’ mom. Perhaps she’s stronger, and more dangerous, then she appeared and simply decided that destroying the coven’s home and splitting up Mae and Osha would be the witches’ only path forward. She could even be the dark figure training Mae in the future and tasking her with killing the Jedi who visited Brendok.</p>
<p id="ytwaoA">An even more exciting version of this theory, however, is that all this destruction was caused by the Jedi all along. Mae, despite her horrific proclamation that she was going to murder the only other child she’d ever known, was mostly blameless and was instead set up and then left to die by a band of Jedi desperate to get their hands on a promising new recruit. This would be genuinely shocking. Not out of line entirely with the dark edges lurking around the Jedi in Star Wars canon (after all, how <em>do </em>they get all those youngling recruits?), but still more gutsy and interesting than almost anything we’ve seen of them on screen. </p>

<p id="gj4aY3">Making the Jedi the true villains of the Brendok fire would mark a meaningful indictment of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24173217/star-wars-high-republic-temptation-of-the-force-tessa-gratton-excerpt">High Republic Jedi</a>, an example of them determining themselves to be judge, jury, and executioner for this extremist outlier cult. Just because they determined the cult to be wrong, they massacred everyone there and attempted to steal both children, but when even that proved too difficult, they simply took one and left the other to die. </p>
<p id="eURhjz">Even in spite of what would be the show’s silly attempt at misdirection, and its often frustratingly wooden dialogue or samey characters, this reveal would be a genuinely exciting one. A real, daring stance on a certain era of Jedi history that, at least in some sectors of the galaxy, was far darker than we had ever thought possible. </p>
<h2 id="XPQnft"><strong>Theory 3: The Disney’s Star Wars theory </strong></h2>
<p id="6folEM">The third theory is the simplest of all: <em>The Acolyte</em> is simply a deeply unserious show, interested in saying something new about the Jedi, the Force, or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23462255/andor-anto-kreegyr-rebels-luthen-anton-krieger">Star Wars universe more broadly</a>, but too concerned with appearances to get the details right — both in terms of storytelling and lore. This theory suggests that there’s no more to the events than we saw on screen: Mae lit a fire in an attempt to kill her sister; it got bigger than she thought and had far-reaching consequences that she blames on the Jedi while shirking her own part in it. With this theory, even if the Jedi did a few things wrong, it would still wash out, with most of them being heroic in the end, leaving everything basically in the same place it started. </p>

</p>
<p id="xI82xM">On paper, this theory would be a profound disappointment. In practice, however, it just feels like what we should expect from most modern Star Wars stories. These projects <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23475574/andor-luthen-stellan-skarsgard-finale-star-wars-character">rarely have the guts to really shake up the franchise</a> and introduce something truly shocking, instead always bringing the status quo back at the end, or simply <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24167362/star-wars-acolyte-high-republic-future">pushing toward events we already know the outcome of</a>. </p>
<p id="VS74qj">Star Wars is firmly in an era of stagnation. So hoping for something fun, interesting, or daring out of a very silly-looking fire, even if it’s set in a totally new time period, is probably a little more than we should expect from the series at this point. Instead, it’s hard not to imagine that <em>The Acolyte</em>’s biggest moment so far is nothing more than rock that inexplicably caught fire because the plot needed it to. </p>

Now, Sega is going back to one of their most critically acclaimed Sonic titles with a re-release of Sonic Generations that includes new content in the form of Shadow the Hedgehog levels. And much to my surprise, that new content is incredibly fun.</p><p>The Summer Games Fest demo for Sonic + Shadow Generations separates the two Sonic levels from Shadow’s newly-built content. For Sonic, the two courses available were Green Hill Zone as Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone as Modern Sonic. To call these levels drastically different, or even slightly different, from the original release of Sonic Generations would probably be a stretch. Both Green Hill Zone stages are functionally the original release running at a higher resolution. This is not a remake of Sonic Generations in any way and it should not be expected to be one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generation State of Play Trailer</h3></div></output><p>That said, Sonic Generations is popular for a reason, and both these levels were still fun to play. In the Classic Sonic version, the shorter and apparently younger Sonic goes through a traditional version of Green Hill Zone that could have been pulled out of any of the older 2D titles. Modern Sonic, meanwhile, grinds on rails, stunts on enemies, and escapes from a giant robotic fish in the air while boosting through. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I cannot overstate how unnecessarily hard Sega goes on these Shadow levels. </p></div><p>The Shadow side is where the Sonic + Shadow Generations gets interesting, providing brand new and more modern content in Shadow’s own revisiting of his past. The only platforming stage available for Shadow is Space Colony Ark paired with the boss fight for the Biolizard, both from his debut game of Sonic Adventure 2. The latter level was in the 3DS version of Sonic Generations, but this was made from the ground up for this release and is not ported from that 3DS version.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In Space Colony Ark, the level pingpongs Shadow along a massive space colony. It tutorializes Shadow's Chaos Control ability, which freezes time and all objects around him to attack or use as platforms. A missile barrage coming from an enemy cannon can be an option to get to a new path with proper use of Chaos Control, which is time-limited. If you fail, it’s just one more reason to replay the level and try to get better.</p><p>Through the Ark, Shadow will occasionally engage in cinematic moments, like using Chaos Control on a missile so large that he has to punch it numerous times to send it backwards into the space fortress it came from, blowing it up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Halfway through the level, a familiar alien creature visits Shadow, transforming the world around him. He lands in a crimson city that looks similar to Westopolis from Shadow’s own game from 2005. As Shadow chases the alien nemesis through a world literally being built around them, the speedster hedgehog interrogates the villain through ambient dialogue and short cinematic scenes. For the Shadow fans in the audience, you need not worry that they dialed back the story for this iteration.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The ending of the Biolizard boss fight does not cease to be cool even if it has been used before.</p></div><p>The other Shadow level, the boss fight with the Biolizard, is less ambitious but still fun. It is a standard Sonic series boss fight that largely involves dodging energy waves on the ground and then jumping up to the boss’ weak point for some punches and kicks the way Shadow loves to do. The ending once again has Shadow beating up a large blast of energy back to the opponent, but it does not cease to be cool even if it has been used before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At the end of every phase, Shadow uses his homing attack to reach the top of the Biolizard’s back and deliver major damage. It’s a classic Sonic boss fight trope, but the act of making it up there still feels frantic and fun.</p><p>I cannot overstate how unnecessarily hard Sega goes on these Shadow levels. For what feels like a small addendum to an otherwise no-frills release, it is clear Sega is trying to make something decently memorable within the series for the Sonic Generations’ new content. It might be a trite comparison that makes veterans of the 16-bit console war bristle, but like Bowser’s Fury was the standout inclusion with Super Mario 3D World on Switch, I suspect that Shadow’s levels will steal the show for Sonic Generations. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Epic Games is readying a new Lego Fortnite update, set to arrive on 13th June, that'll expand the brick-based survival mode with two new difficulty settings catering to polar opposite tastes.
</p>
<p>
First up is Lego Fortnite's new Cozy Mode, designed to offer a laidback experience somewhere between the peril-free japes of Sandbox Mode and the standard-difficulty Survival Mode. Cozy Mode's default settings give players a smattering of combat to keep them on their toes, but with enemies set to easy and all survival meters - hunger, temperature, and stamina - disabled.
</p>
<p>
"Whether you're a beginner survivor or a builder who likes a little bit of thrill," Epic explains on its website, "Cozy mode's up your alley! Create a world and get greeted by Slumber, a friendly face who’ll guide you through your journey step-by-step."
</p>

<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, fearless players wanting to really ramp up the survival challenge also get a new option in Lego Fortnite's v30.10 update, this time in the form of a permadeath Expert Mode. Central to this brutal new offering are Storm-Wild enemies - new opponents that do more damage, have more health, and move faster than standard enemies - but Expert Mode gives the latter a boost, increasing their strength, too.
</p>
<p>
The big challenge, though, comes from that permadeath mechanic. If a player loses all their hearts, they'll be permanently eliminated from their world - but there's a way to avoid that devastating fate. Anyone carrying a Totem of Return upon death is revived in their bed with their backpack, whereupon the totem will be immediately destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Players brave enough to face Expert mode will have the chance to earn three new trophies - the Grasslands Trophy, Dry Valley Trophy, and Frostlands Trophy - each unlocking after defeating a biome specific Storm-Wild Brute then interacting with a Level 10 village.
</p>
<p>
And that's on top of the various Lego Fortnite improvements, adjustments, and bug fixes included in the new update. These range from clearer error messages - specifying low memory issues or instances when too many constructs are nearby - to swimming wolves and reduced skeleton spawns in villages. Full patch notes can be <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode">found on the Fortnite website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest season, the Mad-Max-inspired Chapter 5 Season 3, is currently underway, bringing with it a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">timely Fallout crossover</a> and - according to data miners - an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-season-adds-fallout-nuka-cola-as-files-point-to-upcoming-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover">upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>. The latter inclusion tallies with a previously leaked roadmap detailing Fortnite's plans for 2024 - a roadmap whose veracity has seemed increasingly likely since Fortnite's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">Billie Eilish crossover</a> went live in April.

From handheld ports and next-gen upgrades to full-on VR recreations, Skyrim is a game that you can play pretty much anywhere at this point.</p><p>But, with so many versions of Skyrim to choose from, which should you play in 2024? With multiple editions spread across PlayStation, Xbox, PC and even Switch, it can be tricky to know which release of the game is best suited for the experience you're searching for. Luckily, we've got you covered. Below, we've put together a full guide on all the versions of Skyrim currently available and what's included in each package. You should have plenty of time to play it before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> arrives.</p><h2>How Many Versions of Skyrim Are There?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/01/skyrimspecialedition-1280-1510795773755-1626181651526-1682920471357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In total, there have been <strong>seven </strong>unique releases of Skyrim released across nine different platforms. One of these is a version completely playable through Amazon Alexa known as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-amazon-alexa-skyrim-very-special-edition-is-actually-real">Skyrim: Very Special Edition</a>, which functioned entirely through voice commands. It was largely released as a simple, fun nod to the countless memes about how frequently Skyrim was remastered and, although we can appreciate Alexa dryly describing your epic showdown with a wandering Mudcrab, we won't include it in the list.</p><p>We'll also be moving past 2013's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/06/skyrim-legendary-edition-now-available">Skyrim: Legendary Edition</a>, which was a bundle including the base release of the game and its three expansions. With the release of Special Edition in 2016, Legendary Edition was delisted from Steam. Although you can technically still buy second-hand physical copies of this version on Xbox 360 and PS3, it's not a product Bethesda still sells and so it's one we'll skip over.</p><p>That leaves us with <strong>five</strong> different versions of Skyrim to run through. So, without further ado, let's get started.</p><h2>Every Skyrim Edtion in Order</h2><h3>1. Skyrim - PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 (2011)</h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/06/12/skyrimspecialedition04riverwoodjpg-9d0ddd.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The first version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> that launched all the way back in 2011, the standard edition is about as vanilla as Skyrim gets. Launching on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, it laid the foundation for the game's various updated ports in the years following its launch. However, in 2024, it's probably not worth seeking out.</p><p>Unless you still have an Xbox 360 or PS3 to hand, this will mostly be an option for PC players, and even then, most digital PC storefronts don't even have it appear in their search bars following the release of Skyrim: Special Edition. As for why, It comes bundled with none of the expansions or the visual and gameplay updates that were included in the more modern versions of the game. Considering Special Edition Skrim is quite frequently discounted on storefronts like Steam and GOG, the Standard Edition has been made slightly redundant in the years since.</p><p>That being said, if you're looking to tap into Skyrim's older modding scene, it may still be worth checking out. On both Steam Workshop and Nexus, you'll find mods for the original version of the game, and while they may not be as advanced as the mods that can be built on Special Edition, there's a ton of them to try out.</p><h3>2. Skyrim: Special Edition - PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X (2016)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2012/06/07/gargoylejpg-acfe7c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Launching five years after the standard edition, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition">Skyrim: Special Edition</a> is the most common version of the game currently available. Bundled in this version, you'll get all three of the game's major expansions, Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/skyrim-special-edition-official-gameplay-trailer-2">a suite of visual upgrades</a>, including remastered textures and vastly upgraded lighting.</p><p>One of the biggest additions is access to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-skyrim-se-mods">the Creations tab</a>, which allows you to download free mods made by the community as well as paid Creation Club content packs licensed by Bethesda. This feature is included on console too, meaning you can finally get a taste of the game's modding scene without needing to play the game on PC. Skyrim: Special Edition is often discounted on console and PC, but it can also be downloaded through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-xbox-game-pass-cost">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-tiers-explained-ps5-ps-plus">PlayStation Plus Extra</a>, making it one of the easiest versions to get your hands on.</p><p>This really is the core version you'll be looking at if you just want a no frills, standard Skyrim experience with all the quality of life updates that come with more modern hardware. It's easy to get either through subscription services or sales, and has all of the expansion content included, as well as the option to extend your playtime or mix things up with in-built access to mods.</p><h3>3. Skyrim: Special Edition (Nintendo Switch) - Switch (2017)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/12/skyrimswitch-shield-watermark-1497051957-1497246732781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although technically another port of Skyrim: Special Edition, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/03/skyrim-on-switch-is-everything-you-hoped-it-would-be">Nintendo Switch version</a> deserves its own spot on the list for being a full handheld port that you can play on the go.</p><p>The Switch release also has a few unique features outside of its portability. Players can switch on motion controls, using the JoyCon to attack with a sword or pull back the string of a bow, while the game also includes unique <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/Zelda_Gear,_Master_Sword,_and_Amiibo_Unlockables">Zelda-themed items</a>, including Link's tunic, a Hylian Shield and the Master Sword. If you're looking to clear a few dungeons on your commute to work, this is the version for you.</p><h3>4. Skyrim VR - PC, PlayStation 4 (2017)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/28/skyrimvr-magic-watermark-1497052192-1498692124608.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Just a year after the release of Special Edition, Bethesda decided to release an alternate version of Skyrim that would ramp up its immersion to new heights. This new port was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-vr">Skyrim VR</a>, which does exactly what it says on the tin. Using a PSVR or Windows-based headset, players can hop into Skyrim's world recreated in virtual reality, allowing them to explore its icy plains from a new perspective.</p><p>Skyrim VR includes the full base game and its expansions while implementing motion controls, with players using VR controllers to swing swords, draw bows and pick up items. In essence, it's another version of Special Edition but fully experienced through a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headset">VR headset</a>, so if you want a new way to explore Skyrim and have the tech necessary to play it, it could be one to try out.</p><h3>5. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition - PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Switch (2021)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/05/image-2021-11-05-145823-1636124304089.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The latest version of Skyrim, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim: Anniversary Edition</a> launched in 2021 to celebrate the game's ten-year anniversary. In essence, it's more of an expansion to Special Edition than a full-fledged remaster, bundling together a list of over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-and-new-creations-detailed">70 Creation Club mods</a> for a discounted price. Included are new quests, weapons, armor sets, houses, enemies, dungeons, spells and features, alongside a lot more.</p><p>You can buy Skyrim: Anniversary Edition as a full game, but if you already own Skyrim: Special Edition, you can upgrade to the Anniversary edition for a lower cost instead. Anniversary Edition definitely isn't an essential add-on to the game, but if you've already wandered the world of Skyrim for years at this point and want to freshen things up for your next playthrough, it's worth a look.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-smaller-origins-sized-map-not-all-of-japan-covered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is the next big RPG in the series from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, and the rule for recent RPG-style entries in the series has been “bigger is better.” <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Origins was big</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a> was bigger, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-valhalla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a> was perhaps even a bit larger. So, does Ubisoft plan to push the scope even further for AC Shadows? Thankfully for those who found some recent AC games a bit overwhelming, the answer is no.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Video Games Chronicle interview</a> with Ubisoft Quebec’s Simon Lemay-Comtois, Assassin’s Creed Shadows scales things back to a map “roughly similar to Origins.” Mind you, AC Origins still had a very sizable 80km² world, but at least the map inflation is being curtailed somewhat.</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois further detailed what part of Japan the game focuses on, as Ubisoft won’t be trying to render all of Japan, despite the nation’s relatively compact size.</p>
<p><em>“The story that we focus on is mostly on central Japan, so we don’t expand all the way to the entirety of Japan, so therefore we knew we had a rough idea for the territory we wanted to cover. So, something important happens in Kyoto, something important happens in Osaka, Azuchi – we need these places, so how faithful to these castles can we be, because they’re very interesting, so we build out those castles, they have a very big footprint.</em></p>
<p><em>And then we think about how much of the world do we need between those castles so that it becomes credible and feels like an adventure as you move between them, and it doesn’t take a real four days of horseback riding to get from one to the other. So, it’s kind of a tricky thing to develop, but eventually we find our footing with the types of cities and castles that we want to represent and that’s what justifies the size of our world map.”</em></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sneaks onto PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on November 15. Yesterday Ubisoft shared over <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first footage of its samurai and ninja protagonists in action</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic recently announced that it will add difficulty settings to its survival game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a>, with the v30.10 update later this week, on Thursday, June 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The v30.10 update will introduce Cozy and Expert mode. As the names suggest, each of these modes accommodate very different playstyles. As detailed by a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode" rel="nofollow ">Fortnite blog post</a>, Cozy mode is primarily meant for those who are new to survival games and aren't looking for too much of a challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Expert mode will be catered to those looking for more of a challenge. In this mode, Storm-Wild creatures will do more damage, receive more health, and move faster than normal enemies. In addition to storm enemies receiving a buff, permadeath will be enabled in Expert mode. But if they have a Totem of Return equipped, they'll spawn back at their bed with their backpack.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all the new hardships Expert mode players will have to endure, it isn't all bad, because they'll be able to unlock three trophies to show off. The trophies players will be able to unlock will consist of accomplishments tied to the Grasslands, Dry Valley, and Frostlands. To unlock them, they'll need to defeat the biome-specific Storm-Wild Brute and then interact with said biome village at level 10.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Fortnite content, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-the-best-landing-spots-during-wrecked/2900-5459/#1">gallery highlighting the best spots to land for Chapter 5 Season 3</a>.</p>

These are usually in weird and out-of-the-way places, but they're marked on your map so you'll at least know where to go when you start your hunt. Region Chests are indicated by the little plus signs on your map, which will give you a good starting point. There are three chests in each of the main Pale Heart areas: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse. Each will give you a piece of an encrypted key. You're looking for 15 of these, and the first nine come from Region Chests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Landing_Region_Chest_Locations">The Landing Region Chest Locations</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Landing Chest 1</strong> - From the transmat zone, turn right and go up the stairs. Ahead is a cave and, beside that, a basin area where water is pooling and enemies are hanging out.

That's where you're headed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1917" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387"></a><figcaption>Look for small ledges on this wall to climb up to the building above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To the left of the building, you should see some ledges jutting out from the woody wall, which you can reach from the high ground across the pool.

Enter the Cyst and continue until you reach a room with two round gazebo-like platforms joined by a staircase. You'll find more Hive Knights to kill here with your sword, as well as an Ogre. When you're in the clear, use the sword relic to and look for a small opening in the wall beneath the round platforms and the exit passage.

Early on, you'll find a room with stairs that spiral downward, in which you'll fight an Ogre. Head down to the bottom of the stairs to another round crystalline platform and look for a cavern opening in the wall near you.

Head to The Divide, entering from The Impasse so that you'll find yourself inside a version of the Wall from the Cosmodrome. Keep moving on the linear path until you find a golden chest that looks like the Region Chests you opened earlier. If you'll notice, despite its frozen and blue coloring now, this is the same spot in which you got your first gun when you started playing Destiny (or Destiny 2), in the original Cosmodrome mission when Ghost resurrects you for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317392" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317392"></a><figcaption>The chest is the easiest to reach when you start from The Impasse.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317392-20240605204322_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All 15 Encryption pieces should have given you a new item that lets you unlock this chest. The good news is that you now have Khvostov! The bad news is that it's the Legendary version of the gun, not the Exotic version. To earn that, you have a lot more stuff to do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_4__Collect_All_8_Visions_Of_The_Traveler">Step 4: Collect All 8 Visions Of The Traveler</h2><p dir="ltr">Time for another item hunt. Hidden around the Pale Heart of the Traveler are collectible little Traveler objects--they look like white beach balls. They're all in slightly obscure locations, but you can get clues to find them if you head to the north end of the Tower in the Lost City. Go through the door there and follow the path until you reach a round room full of pedestals. Each of these includes a description of where to find a Vision of the Traveler--one for each area of the Pale Heart. You might also recognize this as the room where the Speaker for the Traveler used to hang out in the original Destiny, before the Red War.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317432" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317432"></a><figcaption>Once you have the eight Visions of the Traveler, a new golden chest will appear.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317432-20240607014208_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Luckily, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-visions-of-the-traveler-locations-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/1100-6524029/" data-ref-id="1100-6524029">Visions of the Traveler guide</a> for finding each of the locations. Place each Vision on its corresponding pedestal in the Tower, and once you have all eight, a second golden chest will appear. You can't open it just yet, though: you lack something.</p><p dir="ltr">What you're looking for are Motes of Light--17 in all. You get one Mote for each Vision of the Traveler you find, for a total of eight. As for the rest, you've got one more big set of objectives to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_5__Complete_Overthrows_In_Each_Pale_Heart_Location">Step 5: Complete Overthrows In Each Pale Heart Location</h2><p dir="ltr">There are nine more Motes of Light you need. Each one drops from a boss in Overthrow, the new patrol activity you can complete in the Pale Heart. To get them, you just need to run complete, four-stage Overthrows in each of the Pale Heart locations that feature them: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse.</p><p dir="ltr">While these can take a while to complete, you don't have to do anything special to get through them, nor do you have to wait a particularly long time to get all those Motes. Each consecutive Overthrow you run in a location will rotate the boss, so you can do three Overthrows in a row in one location to get all three Motes for that spot. The bosses drop them, so look for them on the ground (they're purple diamonds).</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie has noted that if you get your final Mote from a particular boss in The Landing, it can bug the process, so do that set first, just to be safe.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_6__Open_The_Golden_Chest">Step 6: Open The Golden Chest</h2><p dir="ltr">With all the Motes in-hand, you'll get a new version that combines them into a single item. Return to the Tower in the Lost City and head to the room where you dropped the Visions of the Traveler. You should now be able to open the final golden chest, finally earning you the Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guide hub</a> for even more coverage of the latest Destiny 2 expansion.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 10 years, BioWare is finally letting you kiss Lace Harding, the dwarven scout who acts as your initial eyes and ears whenever your character uncovers a new area in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Though you can flirt with her numerous times and establish a strong rapport with Harding, she is not a romantic option in Inquisition--she's not even an official companion. That all changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>--previously titled Dreadwolf--as Harding is not only one of the seven recruitable companions in the game, but she's a romance option, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding is, without a doubt, one of the best parts about Inquisition. Sarcastic and playful, she's willing to trade a few verbal barbs with the Inquisitor if the two establish a bond, and she's a bright and shining spot even during Inquisition's darkest moments, sticking with you and the Inquisition no matter where you choose to go. Fans have been pining for the cute dwarf ever since Inquisition launched in 2014, and I've often wished she could have had a larger part to play in Dragon Age's story. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that she'll be a major player in the fourth Dragon Age game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest, I got to see the opening hour of The Veilguard played by game director Corrine Busche, who answered many of my questions about the upcoming RPG, including how romance would play a part in it. Unlike previous Dragon Age games, which included romantic partners of various sexualities and ancestral preferences, all of the companions in The Veilguard are bisexual and don't seem to have any racial preferences--you can smooch them regardless of who your character, Rook, is--so long as you raise your relationship status high enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Busche made sure to clarify that The Veilguard's companions have been written to be bisexual, not player-sexual. The romantic options don't reshape themselves to satisfy the player character's gender and sexuality. Instead, they have their own hopes, dreams, and desires informed by who they are, and if they can't find what they want with the main character, they'll find it elsewhere. For example, Busche warned me that if my Rook didn't go for Harding (as if, right?), she might find solace with one of the game's other companions in particular, akin to how Garrus and Tali explore their attraction to one another and end up together in Mass Effect 3 if Shepard does not romance either of them as, regardless of who Shepard is, both Garrus and Tali are straight.</p><p dir="ltr">The Veilguard seems to put a lot more emphasis on building relationships with your companions than in previous Dragon Age games. Though your companions will unlock their core abilities over time, the only way to earn special upgrades to these skills is to develop their relationship with Rook. I didn't get to see these upgrades in action during the preview, but I did see how The Veilguard's first two companions--Harding and Neve--perform in a fight. Harding fits the role of a long-range sniper, a rogue initially armed with a bow and arrow, while Neve is a detective and mage who specializes in close-range cold magic.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Busche, you'll meet and recruit every companion by the end of the first act, which should take players about nine to 10 hours--that's a tinge faster than the 15 or so hour recruitment time in Inquisition, which makes sense given The Veilguard only has seven companions and Inquisition has nine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317490"></a><figcaption>Players will recruit seven companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including Bellara, shown here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317490-da_ea_bellara_05_3840x2160_rgb_wm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Faster" seems to be the name of the game for The Veilguard, which looks to do for Dragon Age what Andromeda did for Mass Effect. Your perspective as a player has tightened even further--especially once combat kicks off--shifting to a view more akin to an over-the-shoulder shooter. As spells fly and swords clash, combat seems to pull you into the thick of battle where you must deftly dodge out of the way of an enemy's telegraphed wind-up to land a well-timed combo of your own. Whether you choose to go the way of the warrior, rogue, or mage, you have an assortment of speedy attacks, explosive heavy-hitting abilities, long-range shield breakers, and quick dodges.</p><p dir="ltr">In the opening hour, each battle wrapped up in a matter of moments, and even though Busche pointed out that a tactical menu exists to pause the action and direct Rook's allies, it didn't really look like that was even needed, almost like the feature existed as more of a reminder of what Dragon Age used to be, not what it is now. Real-time combat is not new for Dragon Age, but this is the first time I've seen a game in the series seem to lack much in the way of tactics. For combat at least, The Veilguard appears to lean more toward the action half of action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat isn't the only thing that's different this time around. The Veilguard takes you to Tevinter, a never-before-seen location in Thedas. Unlike the more fantastical locations the franchise has visited so far, Tevinter has more of an arcanepunk vibe, incorporating themes of industrialization. My first look at Tevinter reminded me of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' Eberron, where magic is common enough to be used by everyday people, not just powerful spellcasters. Neon billboards illuminated paved city streets and dark alleys like the backdrop of a noir detective story, and arcane runes powered the city like a faux-electricity. Even though The Veilguard takes place just after Inquisition, it feels like we've been thrown forward a full century to a more modern era.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317491" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317491"></a><figcaption>Like in past BioWare games, choosing which allies to bring on missions can be about tactics or relationships--or both.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317491-da_ea_standard%5Bmage%5D_09_5760x3244_rgb_wm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game picks up in Tevinter at what feels like the end of another adventure, as Rook--with the help of Varric--are on the tail of Solus, working to prevent him from fully destroying the Veil, an act that would surely destroy all life across Thedas. Harding joins their troupe and aids Rook and Varric in meeting with Neve, a detective also on Solus's trail and the trio eventually catches up to the fallen elven god in the midst of a ritual that is tearing the Veil apart.</p><p dir="ltr">The mission showcases plenty of Dragon Age staples (combat, choice-driven dialogue, companion approval) while also revealing what 10 years away have done for the series' visuals. Inquisition isn't an ugly game by any means, but The Veilguard is a cut above its predecessor with special care to particle effects and character animations. It looks like a damn pretty game, and I can't wait to get lost in it with my favorite forward scout at my side.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC this fall.</p>

He stressed that while Nintendo will begin sharing details on the console’s successor in the next nine months, nothing about a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648">rumored Switch 2 </a></span>would be revealed during the upcoming livestream.</p><p>It now seems like the Nintendo Direct is probably targeting a June 18 stream. That’s according to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dczvpj/among_us_update_set_for_june_18th_accidentally/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dczvpj/among_us_update_set_for_june_18th_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video for an upcoming update</a></span> to multiplayer murder sim <em>Among Us </em>that was seemingly accidentally uploaded and published ahead of schedule before being taken down again. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWpFSNUTC-Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWpFSNUTC-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copies of the video</a></span>, which debuts new roles for the the popular pandemic-era party game, are still available and the contents <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gonintendo.com/contents/36449-among-us-update-set-for-june-18th-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/36449-among-us-update-set-for-june-18th-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were reported on by GoNintendo</a></span>. </p><p>While it’s always possible that the video is for a standalone announcement, Innersloth has previously revealed updates in Nintendo Directs, and the words “available now” make it sound like a shadow-drop that would go live when the showcase airs. While companies’ plans can always change, the fact that we’re still waiting on the Direct and the month is almost over makes June 18, or later that same week, feel like the closest thing to a sure bet. </p><p>Nintendo’s 2024 schedule for the Switch is wide open following the launch of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> on June 27. With the console likely to be sunset beginning next year, this will (hopefully) be the last victory lap for it before the Switch 2 is revealed after reported delays. We still haven’t gotten an update on <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, announced at the beginning of the Switch’s life cycle, and with Microsoft going more multiplatform, Square Enix looking to port its past exclusives, and Sony bringing <em>Lego Horizon Adventure</em> to the handheld hybrid, there’s plenty of stuff that could get announced. </p><p>Maybe we’ll even get a new <em>Pokémon</em> game this fall. While <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has already been announced for 2025, it would be great to get a rumored remake of <em>Pokémon Black </em>and <em>White </em>in the meantime. Who knows, maybe we’ll even get an expansion for <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. I’ve already collected ever Wonder seed in the game and am desperate for more levels. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-and-darker-mobile-release-window-platforms-trailer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark and Darker Mobile</a></em> takes the experience of the incredibly popular PC game and pulls it into an experience that plays well and looks great on your smartphone. Ahead of its release, Krafton has announced that it’s getting a beta later this year for all fans to try out. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">The beta for <em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em> is slated for <strong>August 2024</strong>, giving you plenty of time to prepare for how scary these dungeons will be before you sign up and start playing. At the time of writing, there’s no official sign-up page or final date for the beta. However, the date and sign-ups will likely open soon as we enter summer, and Krafton will prepare the game to receive every fan who is excited about dungeon delving and betrayal. </p>
 <h2 id="h-get-ready-for-deceitful-dungeon-action-in-dark-and-darker-mobile-s-beta" data-injectable="false">Get ready for deceitful dungeon action in <em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em>‘s beta</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="1st Gameplay Reveal Trailer | #DarkandDarkerMobile" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhy3serUVP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">Krafton held an initial open beta in Korea in April of this year, which was a massive success. The cap of 50,000 applicants was quickly exceeded, but everyone who got in seems to have thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic gameplay that emerged. The best part about it is how you can forge fake alliances and use enemies to deal with the players you cheat. That’s where I’m going to have a lot of fun in August. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false"><em>Dark and Darker Mobile</em> is very similar to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-and-darker-releasing-in-early-access-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC game of the same name</a>. It’s a grim, low fantasy game where you explore dungeons alone or alongside other players. Every dungeon is packed with enemies for you to kill and loot to claim, but the real danger is much closer to home. </p> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">You see, other players can turn around at any point to stab you in the back and take your share of the loot if they fancy it. The game is all about building trust with others. But if you can’t achieve that, you need to be prepared to take them down at a moment’s notice. After reaching each chest, you can choose to go deeper or make a break for the exit. That risk vs reward system is so tempting that it’s hard to say no, so most players end up overstretching themselves. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">While <em>Dark and Darker Mobile </em>has a visual downgrade compared to the PC version, the gameplay appears to run extremely well. You’ll have no trouble exploring the darkest dungeons and choosing to go for just one more chest while you feel the breath of your allies getting closer to your neck. </p>

The tabletop company has made a reputation for crafting bespoke artisanal board game accessories.

Their Diceapalooza Kickstarter campaign continues that trend with high-quality dice.</p>

<p>According to its campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmwood/dice-a-palooza/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diceapalooza Kickstarter</a> is a crowdfunding campaign dedicated to producing signature dice and dice accessories.</p>
<p>The selection of dice is robust. There are resin dice with names like <em>Ancient Bronze</em>, <em>Chill Out</em>, <em>Rainbow Road</em>, <em>Oops, All Pink</em>. and <em>Fire Glass</em>. For those that appreciate more heft, there are gemstone dice ranging from Cats Eye to Amethyst to Black Obsidian.</p>

This heirloom-quality seven-dice set is made of recycled bronze, perfectly balanced in mass and weight, and chimes when rolled. There are even more luxurious options for metal dice, including gold.</p>
<p>As for their wooden dice accessories, the options are also suitably crafted. These include magnetic and collapsible dice towers, leather-lined personal trays, and foam-lined display vaults with swappable components. You even have your choice of wood from Eastern Elm to Cherry to Black Poisonwood.</p>
<p>Depending on your choice of materials, the prices of the products in the Diceapalooza Kickstarter can vary wildly. For example, an Eastern Elm dice tray is sold at $35 compared to a Black Poisonwood dice tray at $60. This is all excluding shipping fees.</p>
<p>The different pledge tiers for the Diceapalooza Kickstarter are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>General Admission for $5</strong>: Get an exclusive ticket pin</li>
<li><strong>Floor Seats for $50</strong>: Your choice of any resin dice set and an exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>Front Row for $85</strong>: Your choice of any gemstone dice set and exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>VIP for $100</strong>: A prismatic glass dice set and exclusive pin</li>
<li><strong>Platinum VIP for $250</strong>: A set of metal Ember Forge dice and exclusive pin</li>
</ul><p>If you back any of these tiers you can add other items shown in the campaign to your pledge after the campaign has concluded. The only exception to this rule is the Ember Forge dice set, which requires a Platinum VIP pledge.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the Diceapalooza Kickstarter campaign has raised <span><span>$161,204, more than sixteen times its initial funding goal of $10,000. The campaign concludes July 11.</span></span></p>

<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Systemic Reaction has announced the next update for its open world survival game that’s packed with advanced robots out for your blood. The <em>Skyfire Update</em> for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-generation-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation Zero</a></em> brings a lot to the table, extending the game even for players who have hit endgame and find it easy.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Generation Zero’s Skyfire Update</em> will be released on J<strong>une 25, 2024</strong> for all platforms. It brings many new elements to the open world stealth action that players can immerse themselves in. This includes a brand new endgame enemy machine to fight toe-to-toe with, new companion armor kits, more weapons, and an update to various mechanics like the Tyrant spawning system. </p> <h2 id="h-learn-to-master-the-machines-again-when-the-skyfire-update-drops-for-generation-zero" data-injectable="false">Learn to master the machines again when the <em>Skyfire Update</em> drops for <em>Generation Zero</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Generation Zero Skyfire Update Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1oI6HbFK1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">The new enemy type you’ll be battling in the <em>Skyfire Update</em> for <em>Generation Zero</em> is the Vulture. It’s a new Tyrant class enemy that’s evolved from the Firebird enemy type. These things look like they could cause problems for a group, so you need to go in with your top-tier equipment and weapons if you want to take them out. </p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">A new piece of equipment you can get hold of is Companion Armor Kits. Throw one of these at your companions, and it’ll repair their armor on the fly. If your companion’s armor is depleted, you can actually re-kit them with this, too, making it much easier to go out on long runs and survive longer in tough battles. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">The update adds a new weapon to <em>Generation Zero</em>, the Meusser Hunting Rifle. It fires off a chemical laser beam that can set the ground around you on fire. It’s also got a bunch of new weapon augmentations, but you’ll need to kill some Tyrant enemies to pick them up. </p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Lastly, this update adds new Tyrant locations to discover after killing rival machines, gathering the required coordinates, and entering those into Tyrant Terminals in bases. Fixes to machine detention are also coming alongside updated Tyrant progression. </p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false"><em>Generation Zero</em> has grown over the years to offer the best stealth survival experience that pits you against an island filled with hostile machines. The tension you feel playing solo is second to none, and going in with others still feels like you’re facing an insurmountable enemy. </p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="false">This update sounds like it will only improve the endgame and offer something new to grind for after pouring dozens of hours into it. Those rewards feel great to earn because you build up a great collection of tools to head out and test out on machines. I can’t wait to set the ground on fire and watch my enemies burn. </p>

I <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-announces-elder-scrolls-vi-1826718022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blogged about it</a> at the time. Let’s go through my post line by line and see if my predictions came true:</p><p>“It was just a brief teaser that showed a large landscape, and Todd Howard implied it’ll be coming after single-player sci-fi RPG <em>Starfield</em>, which he announced seconds beforehand.”</p><p><em>Starfield </em>is out! <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is not, though it is apparently out of pre-production and in “early development” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-of-pre-production-but-pete-hines-says-it-will-be-years-before-we-start-hearing-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as of last year</a>. Recent comments on the teaser trailer, which has been viewed over 18 million times, celebrate its six-year anniversary. Sort of. “This is like releasing a teaser for <em>Morrowind </em>in 1985,” reads one.</p><p>Assuming <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> comes out during my lifetime, I’m gonna say I was technically correct here.</p><p>“If I had to guess, <em>Elder Scrolls VI </em>will almost certainly be on the next generation of consoles. So you know, get excited about that – and then stow that excitement away like a squirrel hiding acorns in a tree trunk, preparing for a long, cold, <em>Elder-Scrolls</em>-less winter.”</p><p>Past Nathan really loved tortured metaphors, but that’s beside the point. One could read this portion of my old blog and come away thinking I completely missed the mark. After all, what are the odds that <em>The Elder Scrolls VI </em>comes out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S? Seems highly unlikely, given that the now-current console generation has been around for several years, and I sincerely doubt we’ll see Bethesda’s next fantasy opus until <em>at least</em> 2026 – probably later.</p><p>But consider: Which “next” generation of consoles was I referring to? Gave myself a pretty easy out here, and I’m gonna take it. Once again, technically correct.</p><p>“Or, you know, just play <em>Elder Scrolls: Blades</em> to tide yourself over.”</p><p>Damn, I completely forgot that <em>The Elder Scrolls: Blades</em> existed.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the most anticipated games of 2024, Star Wars Outlaws, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> prominently during yesterday's Ubisoft Forward event. Fans got an extended new look at protagonist Kay Vess in action.</p>
<p>Today, we've got an exclusive interview straight from Summer Game Fest 2024 with Ubisoft Massive's Navid Khavari (narrative director) and Mathias Karlson (game director alongside Julian Gerighty), who shared some juicy new details about Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 30. You can read all about the various editions in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our roundup article</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Gameplay Showcase | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did your team first get the idea for an open world action adventure Star Wars game themed around the Underworld?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Good question. I think what we can say is that we started our conversations with the team at Lucasfilm Games sometime in 2021. I think it's a game that felt so natural. It was in us, like as kids growing up with this trinity, specifically that era we're in between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>And getting even the notion that we might be making a game in Star Wars, and then finally ending up with Lucasfilm themselves saying, you know what? With a scoundrel game in the underworld, we think you fit in right in between these two movies. It was just a really cool day.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think there's also an expertise within Ubisoft Massive in terms of the open-world gameplay, design, and world-building that you've seen in previous games, so it was just a natural fit. We always talked about the idea of stepping into Star Wars. That's something we've always wanted to do, and we're looking to realize that.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like developing a game of this caliber right under the pandemic for the first year and a half or so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I mean, it was, of course, new to everyone. I think we quickly adapted. I think any endeavor if you're armed with a really, really clear idea of what you want to achieve, and you have a great team, and in our case also fantastic collaborators in Lucasfilm Games, and we were all, from day one, just pulling in the same direction. We quickly got into a new groove and just kept going.</p>
<p><strong>Now, Kay Vess certainly looks great. However, some Star Wars fans are a bit disappointed as they would have liked an alien protagonist for once. Was that ever a consideration before settling on Kay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> No, I don't think so. We knew very early on that we wanted to set ourselves within a scoundrel and truly Kay, and I should say Kay and Nyx, kind of organically came from that. Their dynamic duo, with Kay being a scoundrel from Canto Bight growing up on the streets as a thief and then having this companion, Nyx, who is a brand new species, a brand new creature that is a meal with sort of a mysterious history. It came about really, really organically.</p>
<p><strong>Can fans expect to see characters from other Star Wars, such as games, movies, and TV shows, appearing in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari</strong>: Yeah, definitely. I think you'll have to wait a little bit, until August 30 (the launch date), to see them all. But you've seen Jabba, you've seen Kira, which was just an unbelievable thing to be able to have in our game. And we recently announced Lando. He's very fun to play Sabacc with. So, I think there's a lot of fun stuff coming in that regard. Honestly, I think if I got into the Easter eggs, your 15-minute interview would be over, so we shall leave some secrets for the launch.</p>
<p><strong>As a quick follow-up, is the expanded universe off-limits for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think I'm not going to answer that one. Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Can you guys discuss Toshara, the new planet you've created in collaboration with Lucasfilm?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Sure. We were going to make a new planet, right? That's pretty cool. Of course, your mind starts racing, and we ended up with something that's very inspired by the savannas of Africa. We even had a part of the team going down there for a research trip. I think something that we found really inspiring was to couple that with something that's very Star Wars inspired just to have a very distinct vibe.</p>
<p>There's a very clear profile. All of Tatooine is desert, and Toshara is windswept on top of this savannah. And the combination of these almost amber-like mountainous structures and the wind that's just been eroding this place for many, many, many years felt very distinct. It felt like something you've never seen before. Definitely not in Star Wars. And then, of course, it's filled with new lore.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> We were really excited about this idea of a planet in the Outer Rim that the underworld sort of finds as a nexus, right? When Kay arrives on Toshara, what was really fun is that her as a rookie having to navigate the Underworld within it is, I think, going to be incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>There is a whole range of characters that you're going to meet, but also just the feeling of zipping around on your speeder on the Tosharan savannah. Nothing really beats it. Lucasfilm really was very generous. I think they put a lot of trust in us to try and bring something new and interesting to the table. When you get on Toshara, the first stop is usually the cantina. You get to meet the locals and understand the dynamics of the characters there. I think it really fits into the underworld fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to see the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth firsthand?</strong></p>
<p>No comment on that one!</p>
<p><strong>Okay. I had to try! Can you tell me how many planets players can visit in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Absolutely, yeah. We have five planets in Star Wars Outlaws. We have Canto Bight, which you might recognize from The Last Jedi. Toshara, which is our brand new planet - or sorry, brand new moon I should say - in the Outer Rim. And then, of course, we have Kijimi, the snow-swept planet that you might recognize from Rise of Skywalker. That is particularly exciting because it's ruled by a new syndicate we're bringing to the table called the Ashita Clan, which is this Melitto species with a hive-like hierarchical structure of control.</p>
<p>Then we have Akiva, which fans of Star Wars will know was featured in the book. It's the first time we're gonna actually be able to see and explore this jungle planet. And then, of course, there's Tatooine, which was just incredibly exciting to bring to life.</p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I think something we're very proud of in this game is being able to offer all of these different locations so seamlessly stitched together in what truly feels like one big slice of the galaxy. Being able to go to your speeder and drive it into your ship, literally take off and hyper-drive wherever you want at your own fingertips and land and then drive out again. I think people will really, really like it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The open world is sizable. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How large of an open world should players expect when landing on the planets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> It's sizable. It's different from planet to planet. It hasn't been an exercise for us that's metrics driven in the sense that we're going for size as a primary motivator when thinking about, okay, how do we bring this planet to life? It will vary. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes. But at the end of the day, it is about being truthful to the source. Or in our case, also some new stuff. And to fit it with things that are interesting. If there's something on the horizon that piques your interest, you can actually drive over there and have a look and you will stumble into some adventure.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the speeder, will it be possible for Kay to ride animals as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>We'll have to wait and see, but the speeder is her primary travel method—her steel horse, if you will.</p>
<p><strong> I want to kind of shift gears over to the Wanted and reputation systems. If your reputation with a certain faction drops too low, is there still a way to repair that relationship and avoid, you know, being shot on-site by their operatives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>100%. So, really central to our philosophy around the reputation system is that Kay is not a character that is about allying with a cause or allegiance and things like this. It's a very free-spirited person who is seeking ultimate freedom for her life. But for you as a player, this very naturally translates into the fact that you're the one navigating this world.</p>
<p>It's about, you know, rolling with the punches and really playing the underworld. You will have means to get back, and at the end of the day, I think you'll come to find that it's more about what you're after than what they can get out of you. You're gonna grow increasingly into the driver's seat, so to say, and how to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> Yeah, exactly, and I think that's very true to Star Wars as well, you know. I like to say that Han, even by Empire, always believed that he could actually pay off his debt to Jabba. And I think it's the same with Kay, right? If you're useful at the right time, you can turn the tide of opinion of someone like Jabba or Kira.</p>
<p><strong>Makes sense. In one of the three demos I played today I did experience that you can essentially pay off a corrupt empire official and reduce Kay's wanted level. Can she also take contracts directly from empire officials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> Mhm.....Can't share. But I think we can share that contracts are one very player-agency-centric part of the game where you have the opportunity to say, okay, I'm on the low side with this syndicate right now. I want to push it up. Or if you really want to enjoy the fruits of being in an excellent reputation end the scale, taking jobs and contracts for the different syndicates is something you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Trailblazer ship, can Kay Vess customize it aesthetically and/or functionally in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> So, in general, progressing and evolving and growing is really I think central to both the narrative and the game itself. Upgrading your abilities with Nyx. Him being able to do even more things for you. Your blaster, your speeder, your ship, you saw that Kay was maybe putting on a different jacket when you played in Kijimi.</p>
<p>That is a very player-centric choice, and these different gear pieces and clothing pieces also have gameplay effects on them. So, there's a lot to look forward to when it comes to both visual and gameplay customization.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so does that include customizing the ship as well, then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. What percentage of the game will be comprised of space exploration&nbsp;or combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>That's really up to you at the end of the day. When we think of Star Wars Outlaws as an open-world experience, space is just a natural part of the Star Wars world as a planet's surface.</p>
<p>So you are at all times free to take off into space and explore that region, jump wherever you want on and around the planets in our game. Both the story, the main campaign, which is the thrust through this game, and the contracts, etc. will also take you to space if you don't go there just on your own accord.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Yeah, and we've described it as the story is kind of an engine. Kay's journey is an engine of pursuit through the different planets and the regions, but there's nothing stopping you from, you know, taking on the contract in space or taking on the dogfight, so I think as Mathias said, it's really how much time do you want to spend in space.</p>
<p><strong>Can you revisit planets whenever you want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. At the end of the day, there's a lot of freedom in the hands of you as a player in that you can revisit or play these planets in the order you like.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of game length are you targeting for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p>It's a full-bodied single-player action-adventure experience that is very scalable with how much time you invest into exploring the world that we prepared for you. So, I'd say it at least doubles the duration of playing just the campaign part if you engage with everything else.</p>
<p><strong>How much time can you spend with Sabacc?</strong></p>
<p>As much as you ask for. And I will tell you I've spent hours playing Sabacc just on its own and it was a blast. The team's done an excellent job of creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you two so very much for your time.</strong></p>

The dwarf is a fan favorite for his cheeky banter, the stories he tells, and his devotion to Bianca, his crossbow he’s been carrying with him in every appearance since 2011. He’s got a personal relationship with Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party member who’s revealed to be a major antagonist at the end of that game. He wants to stop the elven mage’s world-ending plan and he hopes to do it by talking things out. But as Solas refuses to listen, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">Varric</a></span> draws his crossbow…only for Solas to destroy it with a spell. Fans are not okay. The moment is around the 16:45 mark:<br></p><p>Scroll down to the comments on YouTube and you’ll find plenty of fans with a renewed drive to stop Solas’ plans, not just because they threaten the lives of everyone who isn’t an elf, but because Bianca’s destruction must be avenged.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Mofo really betrayed me, stole my gear, took my hand, and now he’s killed Bianca?!!” writes @npc6254.</p><p>“Bold of them to put such an important character death in a teaser.

But Bianca, and Varric’s reverence for the weapon, have been a key part of the dwarf’s story over the years. <em>Inquisition </em>reveals the bow’s namesake and it’s a big moment for a character who tends to shroud his own history with a smokescreen of storytelling. He also doesn’t use other bows despite technically being an archer, and the only way to make him more powerful in that role is to find upgrades for Bianca in <em>Inquisition</em>. For <em>Dragon Age </em>fans, this is like if Cloud’s Buster Sword got snapped in half in the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> <em>Remake</em> game.</p><p>Will Bianca be salvaged? Is Varric going to be okay without his trusty weapon? What is Solas going to do now that Rook dropped a statue on him?

It's a new Dragon Age that continues the series' trend of offering an escalating sense of high-fantasy political and social intrigue, yet still seeks to highlight BioWare's long-standing strengths when it comes to having a cast of compelling characters and deciding their fate. The game has been unveiled after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bioware-lays-off-50-staff-as-part-of-long-term-reorganization">layoffs at the studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and years of challenging—but seemingly not impossible—directional shifts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we saw an extended demo of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s prologue, with commentary from creative director John Epler explaining BioWare's big focus on companion characters—a quiet return to the studio’s design roots.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare's high-fantasy comeback">BioWare's high-fantasy comeback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Set after the events of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next game sees the world of Thedas facing a new threat posed by Solas, a former ally now turned villain. Seeking to destroy the barrier between the ethereal Veil and the mortal realm to restore his people, Solas unleashes otherworldly forces. A new hero, referred to as Rook, teams with returning heroes Varric and Harding to form a new party to face these threats – which inevitably unearth a greater foe that seeks to destroy all life in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Epler, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular, focuses on the themes of choice and consequence, and that a world at its bleakest is still worth saving. Like other games in the series, it features a fully customizable protagonist with different backstories and cultural backgrounds (human, dwarf, elf, and qunari), giving a more comprehensive range of options to make the protagonist feel like a natural part of the world that's been plucked out of obscurity to become a hero.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This follows in BioWare’s tradition of making Dragon Age protagonists more of a blank slate for the player—an ambitious challenge given how much game content has to evolve around the player’s long string of choices – which are reflected in the BioWare standard dialogue wheel.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strong cast of supporting characters in a BioWare game has been a staple for the developer. Epler stated that the developers were keen to lean into that with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which he says has the most developed companions and related storylines from any BioWare game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been on every Dragon Age game previously, and I think the biggest thing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brings to the larger series experience is an even heavier and more deliberate focus on the companions," said Epler. "We've been saying that it's the most deliberately crafted companion experience we've ever done – each character is integral for you to save the world, and they each bring something to the table. These characters are important, and each will have their mission to see and learn more about them."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content">BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The extended demo's dramatic and action-focused opening offered a clear view of what kind of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be, which sticks with the familiar mainstays of an ensemble BioWare RPG. However, the upcoming game also has a more stylized aesthetic and snappier gameplay compared to the more gritty and tactical pace of the original game and its sequels. It's an action-focused RPG, with the combat itself having a similar flow and pace to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Witcher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games. However, Dragon Age's familiar tactical pause also makes a return, allowing players to carefully choose skills at your leisure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a sharper narrative focus on the companions, combat still sticks solely to the protagonist, a contrast from the game’s earlier entries, which afforded the player more cross-party control. However, the game empowers players by allowing them to send commands to allies, strategically coordinating with the protagonist. This feature, reminiscent of Mass Effect's tactical commands, reminds players that these are separate characters with their own agency.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During one critical moment in the prologue, Rook had to choose which party member to accompany them in a plan to thwart Solas' spell while leaving one party member behind to hold off incoming monsters. It’s a decision that will shape how each party member views Rook in the adventure ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epler said that as with previous BioWare games, companions will also have a set of unique quests tied to their individual stories, which will branch out throughout the game. How you build your party and what choices players make will define the type of adventure Rook and his party will have, which Epler stated are all bespoke events outside of the critical path.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the big things we wanted to do with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is to have the entire game feel like a crafted and authored experience," said Epler in a post-presentation follow-up. "While the game does have a lot of content that's not part of the critical path, and the various side-missions, all of that is hand-crafted by the team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This again alludes to a return to form for BioWare, which experimented with fewer hand-crafted set pieces in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect: Andromeda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If it’s successful here, it’s an unfortunate rebuke of the studio’s directional shifts for its previous two games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks more like a stylized grand adventure for the series that bolsters its cast of heroes, though we didn't quite get a look at how many of these choices will come into play when your party begins to explore Thedas during a chaotic period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been interesting to see where BioWare is as a developer currently, and it's no secret that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has had trouble with development as various staff turnovers have extended dev time. That said, the upcoming game has intriguing flourishes and a tone that could be a nice pivot for the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With recent successes from other fantasy RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showing that building up a great cast and seeing them evolve with one another has a lot of value to a role-playing game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be doing the smart thing by focusing on what BioWare has traditionally done best, and that's put its cast of characters in the spotlight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was interesting to see a far more stylized adventure-like tone for</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dragon Age, which began its life as a dour, proper noun-laden adventure.

<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the reveal of the upcoming summer update, Sakurajima, <em>Palworld </em>is once again in the spotlight. The reveal came at this year’s Summer Game Fest, and<em> Palworld’s </em>community manager, Bucky, detailed his experience at the event on Twitter. While mostly positive, Bucky noted a few encounters painted <em>Palworld </em>as “the boogeyman” for some people. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">In his post, Bucky opened with his better experiences at the show, then acknowledged the team is “more than aware of all the Palworld discourse” since its launch earlier this year. According to Bucky, claims that<em> Palworld</em> was made with AI, stolen assets, and is the target of a lawsuit are all false. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Bucky has always been pretty outspoken when it comes to negativity aimed at <em>Palworld</em>. Back in February, he again posted on <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to touch on the ‘dying’ game discourse, saying that it’s ‘<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworlds-community-manager-says-its-fine-to-take-breaks-amid-negative-player-count-discourse/">okay to take breaks</a>’. This time, he’s aired his feelings over what he says were a minority of Summer Game Fest encounters. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Summer Game Fest comes to a close and the long flight back to Tokyo begins…lots to process but overall it was an incredible weekend. Long post incoming:</p><p>1: Meeting other devs and industry folk was so much fun. Whereas GDC was very much about the business of games, SGF felt more…</p></div>— Bucky | Palworld ✈️ Summer Game Fest (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1800269900545478921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">For most of the post, Bucky has nothing but nice things to say about his experience at the convention, from meeting other devs and fans to meeting some of his own personal heroes. He seems to have had a good time, explaining that it was “great to share stories and advice with others in the industry”’ as they sometimes feel ‘”a bit isolated in Japan.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="false">Bucky goes on to promise that <em>Palworld </em>will continue to get bigger and bigger, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/">Sakurajima update</a> that’s coming on June 27 is part of that plan. The update will add new Pals, Raids, and Bosses to challenge. We’ll see that accompanied by new areas to explore and expanded building options, too.</p>
