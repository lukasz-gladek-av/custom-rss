			<p>Bloober Team has always been synonymous with horror, from their earliest days with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/16/layers-of-fear-review/">Layers of Fear</a> through to the high profile <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. It has, however, been nearly 5 years since their last original title, the somewhat divisive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium,</a> so the pressure on Cronos: The New Dawn to deliver is heightened. Can the Polish developers follow up on the success of their work on Konami’s legendary series in a story of their own devising? To do so, Cronos takes clear influences from the usual survival horror mainstays of Silent Hill and Resident Evil but there is also a large slice of Dead Space, from character design to gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | A New Breed Of Horror" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dY2fTE07h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos features a complicated narrative full of time travel and dimensional travel, but it all boils down to a story of betrayal, grief, and coping with the effects of a pandemic. Post Covid-19 any story that revolves around communities locked down to prevent the spread of disease will take on a greater resonance for players and this is certainly the case here. Notes and environmental cues abound that tell a tale of a scared population torn between self preservation and communal survival. The disease here is a mysterious affliction that turns victims into monstrous ghouls that merge with each other to create even greater threats.</p>


<p>Dead Space is the most obvious influence here graphically, with the main protagonist, enigmatically named The Traveller, wearing an exosuit that recalls Isaac Clarke (and Bioshock’s Big Daddy to a lesser extent). The Traveller feels similarly chunky too, with deliberate movement rather than agility being the name of the game. Environments are largely dark and depressing, with effective mood lighting and signposting alongside some gnarly body horror aspects. Many areas are covered in a biomass that oozes and throbs as you move past it, whilst others are desolate and windswept. These environments are contrasted with occasional serene moments where you travel back to the town of New Dawn before the epidemic and are faced with scenes of everyday normality.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of New Dawn follows the familiar pattern of finding keys, unlocking shortcuts and solving environmental puzzles. The latter does feature the new addition of a power that can manipulate timespace anomalies to change the environment for your benefit. This is mostly used to reveal hidden paths (sometimes requiring you to take detours to find an angle where the anomaly is visible) or to access secret areas filled with loot but later game boss fights also use this mechanic to great effect. The progression is quite strictly linear, which feels appropriate for survival horror and means that there is little backtracking.</p>
<p>Alongside your anomaly manipulation power, you have a basic melee attack which is mostly used to destroy item boxes or as a last resort when ammo is low, and an adaptable sidearm which can take various forms to mimic the standard horror arsenal. It starts as a basic handgun that can be charged for extra damage, but you find shotgun, automatic, and even a powerful arbalest as you make your way through the horrors of New Dawn. Somewhat annoyingly, however, these different forms take up extra spaces in your limited inventory so I found myself sticking to the initial handgun and shotgun throughout. I appreciate that this is a convention of the genre, but some games have taken to separating the inventory from your weapons and I think this enables you to try out a greater range of weapons, aiding in a feel of gameplay variety. Upgrading weapons is a slow process too and whilst this is undone for a small cost your current guns are usually more effective than the ones you find.</p>

<p>Combat is a deliberate and intense affair. Many enemies take multiple shots to go down, with fully charging being essential. If you allow enemies to merge they become even more powerful, eventually being impervious to bullets and requiring you to use fire and explosive barrels to damage them. My first playthrough resulted in me being hunted by a merged enemy when I had no ammo to damage it and necessitated a reload as I came to terms with this mechanic. Setting fire to corpses prevents merging, but you also have limited torch ammo so you need to be strategic as to when to use it.</p>
<p>You are not entirely alone in your quest though as you are preceded by a host of former operatives who leave clues, tools, and pathways for you to find. Fairly early on you’ll also meet The Warden, a fellow traveller who plays an increasingly important role in the story of Cronos. Alan Turkington brings a welcome degree of mystery and gravitas to this role in his vocal performance. You’ll also find survivors, some of whom are targets for retrieval as you are sent to recover their ‘essence’ in order to learn how to prevent the tragic disease from happening. The moral ambiguities around this process are a key part of the larger tale being told and it is far from a simple hero’s story.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, however, are the ten cats that are scattered throughout the game. Finding these furry friends almost always requires venturing off the main path or solving optional puzzles, but the rewards for doing so are worth it. Most obvious are extra currency or upgrade materials but, once rescued, these feline companions also congregate in your main base and provide a welcome level of life to the desolated environment. Other upgrades can be found through absorbing the aforementioned ‘essence’ with each providing different buffs. There are various achievement that rely on you maintaining specific essences throughout but an initial playthrough will see you swapping each out as you progress with only three being able to be stored at once.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/footage-of-human-head-studios-prey-2-leaks-online-over-a-decade-after-it-was-cancelled.1287507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before Arkane Austin made its Prey game, a developer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/human-head-rune-ragnarok-interview/">Human Head Studios</a> created and developed Prey as a first-person shooter centered around a Cherokee named Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi, who ventures on a quest to save his grandfather and his girlfriend after they're taken by an alien spaceship currently in orbit around the Earth. It was released on PC and Xbox 360, and a sequel was in development until the game was cancelled in 2014.</p>



<p>Between 2006 and 2014, the rights for Human Head Studios' Prey went from its 3D Realms, who initially helped publish the game, to a different company called Radar Group, to ZeniMax Media, who modern players will recognize today as a Bethesda and ZeniMax company, and overall a subsidiary of Microsoft and Xbox. It was under ZeniMax, unfortunately, where Prey 2, which had bounced around in development limbo for years, was canceled, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rune-developer-human-head-studios-closes-down-and-reopens-as-roundhouse-studios-at-bethesda/">Human Head Studios was officially shuttered</a> and subsumed into Bethesda as Roundhouse Studios in 2019.</p>



<p>Now, more than a decade after Prey 2 was cancelled and a little under a decade since Arkane Austin made its entirely separate but similarly titled Prey, gameplay footage for Human Head Studios' Prey 2 has leaked online.</p>



<p>A post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/">Reddit</a> includes links for what would have been Prey 2's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">opening</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSNdZBLCvog">gameplay demo</a> that might've appeared at an E3 show, and a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDwfoEv20iE">earlier development</a> clips of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoYaYVPY5WA">gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7OIifeZ-s">combat</a>, all uploaded by a YouTube channel under the name '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.'</p>



<p>The footage is incomplete, but it does give fans of the 2006 Prey a sense of what the team was striving for in a sequel, hoping to take the core elements of Human Head's first Prey game and evolve on them.</p>



<p>At the time of Human Head Studios' shuttering, co-founder Chris Rhinehart said, "<em>Sadly, we had to wind down the business of Human Head Studios and close its doors, which was particularly devastating due to the passion and creativity of the team we’d assembled</em>."</p>



<p>The video game industry wasn't in such dire straits in 2019 compared to its current state, so thankfully, at the time, the whole team was able to stay together and were given new jobs at the aforementioned Roundhouse Studios, which was formed under Bethesda as a way to keep Human Head together. Though it only bought them a few more years, since the mass layoffs since then, not to mention the latest round of mass layoffs that saw significant cuts to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, likely split the team up for good. </p>

			<p>Following the release of several <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/">horror games</a> to a reception ranging from positive to mildly negative, sometimes due to how particular sensitive themes were addressed, Polish developer Bloober Team has risen considerably in the estimation of survival horror fans for the excellent work the studio has done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, a faithful adaptation of the classic Konami game enhanced by some modern features that make it a joy to play. While the Polish studio is set to continue this fruitful collaboration with the development of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/"> remake of the first entry in the series</a>, Bloober Team is also expanding its own properties with new titles, the first of them being Cronos: The New Dawn. Right from the game's reveal, it was made clear how this game would be a threshold release for the studio, moving past the narrative-focused experiences such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/"> Layers of Fear series</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> to delve deeper into the survival horror genre. And while it is definitely a little flawed, there's no denying that Bloober Team created a solid game that becomes rather engaging once things really get going.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The true mission of The Travel and the real purpose of The Collective are among the mysteries hidden in Cronos: The New Dawn</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set in a twisted reimagining of Krakow's Nowa Huta district, one of the city's districts built as a utopian ideal city meant to mirror European capitals like London and Paris. Instead of exploring the grandeur of the most populous district in Krakow, players will get to explore a ruined version of the district, its population completely decimated by a terrible plague known only as The Change, which turns human beings into horrible, mutated monstrosities known as The Orphans. Despite the current situation, humanity doesn't seem to have been left to its doomed fate, as a mysterious organization known as The Collective is sending individuals wearing massive protective armor to investigate The Change and fight off any monsters on their path. After many of these individuals have died on the path to truth, it will be up to a new Traveler to retrace their steps and rescue certain individuals from the 1980s via time rift before they succumb to the Change. After meeting The Warden, another armored individual tasked with providing members of The Collective with the tools needed to survive New Dawn, however, it starts becoming clear how there's a lot more behind The Change, the recovery of individuals from the past, and the purpose of The Collective.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn's setting and story are undoubtedly some of the best features in the game. The Polish setting is rather unique for video games, and the game's time-travel gimmick allowed for the creation of dual worlds, which are incredibly interesting to explore, although the almost constant nighttime doesn't provide a lot of visual differences between the two. With environmental storytelling in the vein of the Souls series, and scattered documents in the vein of classic survival horror games, piecing together the story and the events that happened before and during the outbreak of The Change is also quite engaging, although the game does feature plenty of cutscenes that provide clarity on some of these events and make it easy to follow the plot at its base level. With some difficult choices to make at times as well, Cronos: The New Dawn does an excellent job immersing players into the role of The Traveler, making them hunger for the next big reveal.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn's story is engaging and immersive right from the very beginning.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Having a great story that's gripping right from the start is generally good for any game, but in the case of Cronos: The New Dawn, it's even better for a particular reason: the first few hours of the game do a terrible job introducing the experience, so much so that I expect some will drop the game entirely before things start getting good. This is caused mainly by what immediately feels like a by-the-books survival horror experience clearly inspired by the Dead Space series, only with a really unremarkable enemy design, both in terms of combat and visual design, and a considerably worse combat system with no dismemberment mechanics that requires some time and resource investment in weapon upgrades to become fun. Exploration and traversal fare a little better thanks to an intricate level design, and the lack of an in-game map, which enhances immersion considerably while forcing players to rely on the environment's visual elements to find their way (although there's an optional waymarker system that guides players to their next objective).</p>



<p>Though exploration and traversal improve fairly quickly with the introduction not only of optional locations filled with much-needed resources like Energy, materials to craft items, and spare ammo as well as documents and Travelogs that provide additional information on the setting and story, but also of the Anomaly mechanics, which can be used to alter the environment by manipulating time, representing a unique way to provide additional puzzles alongside those of the more traditional variety, like locked doors and passwords to find, combat does not. </p>



<p>With their hulking armor, The Traveler is really slow and has no real defensive option, not even the ability to turn 180 degrees when needed, so proper positioning and headshots with the handgun, whose shots can be charged for extra damage, are the only things that separate The Traveler from an early death at the start of the game. With enemies not reacting a lot to shots, combat feels unsatisfying in the first few hours, dragging the entire experience down. Even after introducing the Orphans' ability to consume their dead to power up, requiring The Traveler to burn their bodies using the Shell Suit's flamethrower, things don't improve. In its basic form, the handgun is a really weak weapon, and with ammo being so scarce, every combat encounter becomes a stressful exercise where luck seems to play a bigger role than skill. Ending up with no ammo in a forced combat encounter, with no weapon to rely on other than the weak melee attacks, including a stomp that looks more powerful than it actually is, is a frustrating experience that I expect will make a few players simply give up on the game.</p>



<p>My frustration with the Cronos: The New Dawn's combat system reached its peak right before the game's first boss battle against a massive Orphan set in a small location with several rooms whose design provides the cover needed to shoot the canisters scattered around to stagger the enemy and reveal its weak points. It's during this battle, or rather after a few failed attempts, that I started appreciating what the game tries to do with its combat mechanics. Upgrading the handgun and the shotgun, deciding on the fly how to use the resources in my possesion to craft either ammo or healing items, which can be easily done without opening the menu by holding either the directional shortcut to which a weapon is assigned or the healing button, picking up some resources on the combat grounds to allow for emergency crafting, finally clicked together, completely changing my perspective on the game. </p>



<p>After obtaining the first Essence, the soul of one individual related to The Change outbreak, and enjoying a welcome passive bonus, and meeting The Warden, ammo started becoming available in bigger quantities, making it much easier to handle Orphans and manage resources, which continue to be scarce, but not as scarce as they are in the first couple of hours, although that wasn't the end of the frustration, as there still some forced enemy encounters on the way that were, sometimes, a little too challenging with the available resources.</p>



<p>As The Traveler's mission proceeds, more combat and exploration tools are unlocked, including small explosive bombs called Pyre and anti-gravitational boots that further enhance the experience a lot, so much so that I had a difficult time putting the game down. Granted, some flaws remain evident, such as the average enemy visual design, which makes it almost hard to tell one enemy type apart from another, and the generally predictable survival-horror experience, but how every gameplay element comes together in the end made it easy for me to look past most of these issues, ultimately making making me appreciate some of the game's unique quirks even more, including managing how to burn the bodies of dead Orphans to prevent a powerful enemy from becoming even more powerful, while making me forget the frustrating first couple of hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a few hours to get going, but when it does, the experience becomes quite engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enhancing the Cronos: The New Dawn experience are the game's visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5. While the game eventually becomes a little predictable in terms of visual design, as already mentioned, it's difficult not to notice how the good usage of lighting and volumetrics enhances the entire experience, even without hardware ray tracing. The solid visual design of New Dawn, which gives it a distinct industrial vibe, is accompanied by great texture and character models work, except for the aforementioned enemy design, which looks rather generic, and some evident asset recycling from the Silent Hill 2 remake, as the hair of one character makes really evident.</p>



<p>Being powered by Unreal Engine 5, however, some stuttering issues were expected on PC, and they sadly are in. Though the game has a shader precompilation step, which reduces shader stuttering issues, the game clearly suffers from traversal stuttering issues that, while not frequent, are easily noticeable and immersion-breaking. Given the game's visuals which rely a lot on lighting, enabling hardware ray tracing hits performance considerably, as the game ran at an average of 55 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS in Balanced Mode without Frame Generation at the high Quality Preset at 4K resolution traveling around The Terminal, which serves as some sort of main hub, on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM). At the same settings, enabling Frame Generation (and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 users</a>) boosts performance in the same area at an average of around 80 FPS, so using frame gen tech will be the way to go for the vast majority of players who want to experience the game with ray tracing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cronos: The New Dawn 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Balanced, Ray Tracing, Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cubXYGJWR1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Disabling ray tracing greatly improves performance, as the game ran at close to the 100 FPS mark in the same scenario without it. Sadly, there aren't a lot of graphics settings to tweak outside of a comprehensive Quality Preset and a few others that have minimal impact on performance, like motion blur, so upscalers (TSR, DLSS, FSR 3.1, and XeSS) and frame generation are the only features that can help the user achieve the desired level of performance in the game. Though lacking in graphics options, Cronos: The New Dawn comes with others that should be the standard for PC games but often aren't, including rebindable controls, ultrawide resolution support, and a wealth of accessibility features such as multiple Color Blind modes, quick-time event settings, and more.</p>

<p>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-hits-clearance-level-pricing-ahead-of-new-s11-tablet-launch.1287495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>September is here and even though we still technically have a few more weeks of summer, culturally, it’s over. That’s because all the kiddos are headed back to the classroom to kick of the new school year. And with that comes tons of back-to-school sales.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet which usually goes for $220 dropped by 30%.</a> That saves you $65, bringing the price down to just $155 for a limited time. You’re getting an 11-inch touch display for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Look and Sound</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is packing an LCD screen that has a resolution of 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. The built-in speakers supply a powerful and rich sound you can hear clearly with the help of Dolby Atmos. You’re getting cinema-like sound in the palm of your hands. Alright, you and I both know a tablet isn’t producing “cinema-quality” audio. Those are Samsung’s words and even though that “like” is doing a lot of heavy lifting, it’s still quite relatively speaking when talking about tablets.</p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>At 11 inches across, the tablet is light and slim in design, yet remains durable. That makes it wonderfully portable so you can take it with you when traveling on long weekend trips, or just with you to your local coffee shop to get some work done or enjoy some reading with a change of scenery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">You have two choices or storage capacities.</a> To no one’s surprised, the less expensive model of the two is the lower capacity 64GB model. You have an option for twice that with 128GB. Storage is good for if you find yourself downloading a bunch of movies and shows, though if you’re just streaming everything anyway, the 64GB model will be perfectly suffice.</p>



<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is running Android OS which can actually have multiple apps open side-by-side at once. You can switch back and forth between different tasks or have two more tabs open next to each other for easy viewing.</p>
<p>Moving files to and from the Tab A9+ is pretty simple. Quick Share allows you to just select a file and transfer it immediately to a nearby device. That even works for phones and tablets running something other than Android OS.</p>
<p>The Samsung Kids app makes this tablet a great choice for parents who might be sharing the tablet with their children. Not every kid needs their own dedicated smart device and the Kids app is filled with a bunch of playful content appropriate for kids.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team is hot off the heels of its 2024 success. Cronos: The New Dawn is a brand-new IP from the makers of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and it has everything you could want from a survival-horror game: A nervous atmosphere, a constant feeling of trepidation and jeopardy, grotesque monsters, and an inventory so limited you’re wondering if you can stuff a few more ammo clips into your suit.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> feels <em>safe</em>—and I hate using that word with new games, as it feels like an insult. It feels like a pejorative, but in many cases (this one especially) it’s a compliment. Bloober Team throws out the odd new idea here and there, but the game feels like a well-rounded survival horror title with an interesting story.</p>



<p>The game’s central enemy mechanic revolves around the concept of merging, and it feels like Cronos has dipped its hand into the best pots, aptly creating an amalgamation of tried and tested horror tropes to produce a polished and impactful debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Did you pay for your fare? I don’t think so. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>You are a nameless Traveler: A mysterious figure sent to retrieve items, uncover time rifts to gain a deeper understanding of the planet’s implosion, and explore its fallen remnants in search of The Traveler who came before you. The ‘Change’ brought the world to its knees and executed it in cold-hearted fashion. All that remains is a series of monsters—each more unpleasant than the last—who merge with defeated enemies and become stronger—which is a real problem for you!</p>



<p>I found the first hour of <a href="https://cronosnewdawn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> to be a bit slow and unengaging, to be honest. You think of Silent Hill 2’s foggy and genuinely haunting opening moments, whereas Dead Space hits you with loud, blaring danger sirens as a Necromorph tries to pierce you in a tense elevator chase sequence. Any lingering doubts quickly evaporated into intrigue, and the story and gameplay improved progressively. It crescendoed by the end of my 14 hours in Cronos’ hellscape, and I was truly left wanting more when the credits rolled.</p>



<p>The story feels a bit ambiguous and ambitious for its scope at times, but the final payoff is satisfying. It probably requires a second playthrough to fully grasp the intricacies of the narrative’s details, which are revealed through cutscenes and typical world-building notes and tapes scattered throughout the game’s various vile and decrepit biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-fix-what-isn-t-broken">Don’t Fix What Isn’t broken</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nope. Just nope. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played any survival-horror game before, Cronos swiftly becomes second-nature. You need to be accurate, learning the game’s charge-up mechanic is crucial to make shots stronger and optimize ammo management, the upgrade system is a slow-burner (don’t expect to upgrade even half your gear by the time your first playthrough is done), and the pacing ducks and dives between combat-heavy encounters and exploration.</p>



<p>The game genuinely improves as it unfolds, allowing you to acquire more weapons and tools. I would’ve liked more variety in the weaponry, but your flame Tool and explosive bombs you get later on compensate somewhat. Cronos’ levels range from snowy exteriors to dank, dilapidated residential buildings with monsters scuttling around every surface. You risk eternal dizziness as you need to have your head on a swivel, lest you get pounced on by an unsuspecting enemy.</p>



<p>My favorite portion of Cronos was a hospital section midway through the game—no prizes for where the inspiration came from here. Puzzles aren’t really at the forefront of Cronos’ design, but this area requires multiple keys and special items as are necessary for doors and hidden areas. The tension was palpable throughout, too. My anxiety and nervousness were through the roof as I ventured into unknown corridors and rooms, and there wasn’t enough absorption in the world to mop up my terror sweats.</p>



<p>Cronos has jump scares aplenty, and its addictive 80s synth music offsets any built-up paranoia you’re likely to experience. As much as you won’t want to, searching the vicinity is a must. Despite being advertised as a hard game, I comfortably finished Cronos with under 10 deaths—but I am well-versed in the genre. Seek out Energy, look for Cores, and your cat-like curiosity will be rewarded—there are literally cat collectibles. </p>



<p>If you’re worried there’s not enough of a challenge, a Hard Mode is unlocked at the end, along with a New Game+ setting.</p>



<h2 id="h-room-for-one-more-please">Room For One More, Please?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive journey. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll flat-out say Cronos’ inventory system is frustrating beyond belief. It’s probably the most oppressive balancing act since Resident Evil 0. If you don’t focus your Core upgrades on increasing your inventory slots ASAP, you’re going to suffer. Each ammo slot doesn’t hold much ammo, and you can never truly have a consistent balance of ammo and health.</p>



<p>If you find a health item out in the open, you can’t use it; it <em>has</em> to be in your inventory. The only way to drop items is to permanently discard them. You’re telling me we can have magical inventory boxes that can transfer your gear from one safe area to the next, but I can’t use a first aid pickup right in front of me?</p>



<p>You often have compulsory story items taking up slots, and I ended up not really using the game’s central burning mechanic because each flame canister—you guessed it—takes up an inventory slot. I felt punished for minimizing ammo and resource waste. Now, I think the game’s Hard Mode will be better-suited for me, and inexperienced horror fans are probably going to chew through supplies faster than a hungry mouse does a block of cheese, but veterans might get the ick from the system’s obtrusiveness.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-verdict">Cronos: The New Dawn Verdict</h2>



<p>The critic in me will say Cronos: The New Dawn isn’t transcendent. Again, this is ok. What Cronos does, it does very well, and taking the recency bias of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> out of the equation, I can’t recall a new survival-horror game I’ve enjoyed this much and found this immersive in a while.</p>



<p>Once it gets going, Cronos batters you with a buffet of scares, stress, and superb combat. I can’t overlook the stingy inventory management headaches that will last a lifetime, but there’s no denying that Cronos: The New Dawn wants you to think and strategize. I’ll wrap up this review by saying Cronos: the New Dawn is an excellent new survival-horror title. If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-play, and old-school horror fans will love this: Such is our calling.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app gets a little bit bigger tomorrow, as the House of Mario revealed that the classic shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forsaken-1998/" data-ref-id="5000-103">Forsaken 64</a> will be making its way to the app on September 4. As always, this is only for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, and you'll need to have the Mature version of the Nintendo 64 app downloaded in order to play it. Forsaken 64 is actually only the fifth game to release on the Mature app, joining other classics like Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who might be on the younger side, Forsaken 64 is a shooter that first released way back in 1998 on the original Nintendo 64, as well as PlayStation and PC. It's set in the still-far-off year of 2113, where all life on Earth has been wiped out following a science experiment that caused a shockwave to hit the entire planet. The N64 version is actually unique compared to the PlayStation and PC versions--in the latter two, you play as someone trying to obtain some lost treasure, whereas in the former you play as a character trying to thwart said thieves by taking them down.</p><p dir="ltr">A big thing that sets the game apart from that era of shooters is its movement--the game has a full six degrees of freedom, meaning you can move backwards and forwards, side to side, up and down, and combinations of all of those too. You'll also be able to play in multiplayer with up to four players at once like in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">Forsaken 64 releases on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app on September 4.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-september-hollow-knight-silksong-i-am-your-beast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-major-indies-enter-xbox-game-pass-this-week.1287468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/02/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in September 2025, with two of the six games overshadowing the rest despite both being indie titles, as I Am Your Beast and Hollow Knight Silksong enter the subscription service.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a>, you might recall, is developer Strange Scaffold's fast-paced, first-person, parkour-shooter, as you run around individual levels eliminating everyone in your path while going for the fastest times. It was one of 2024's better indie titles from the same studio that released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/">El Paso, Elsewhere</a>, the year before, which is also being made into a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://deadline.com/2024/04/el-paso-elsewhere-movie-starring-lakeith-stanfield-in-works-1235890630/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9p7T-0LyPAxVSDzQIHZXxImEQFnoECB4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zCdyhWx36_ex6-sLdn0zd">feature film</a>.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong needs no introduction at this point, with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass being significant if you want to avoid paying its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">$19.99 price tag</a>. That might seem like a small price to pay for what has been heralded as one of the most anticipated indie titles in the last decade, but it follows the same model Team Cherry used with Hollow Knight, which has mostly stayed at $14.99 since it launched in 2017.</p>

<p>The rest of the games entering Xbox's subscription service this week and the first half of this month include Saber Interactive's RoadCraft, RedCandleGames' Nine Sols, a game you could argue is heavily inspired by Hollow Knight. Strategy and city-builder Cataclismo, and PAW Patrol World.</p>



<ul>
<li>I Am Your Beast - Xbox Series X/S, PC, Cloud - available September 2</li>



<li>Nine Sols - Xbox Series X/S - available September 3</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - September 4</li>



<li>Cataclismo - PC - available September 4</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - available September 10</li>



<li>RoadCraft - Xbox Series X/S, Cloud - available September 16</li>
</ul>



<p>As with every month, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. As of September 15, the following three games will no longer be available in Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<ul>
<li>All You Need is Help</li>



<li>Wargroove 2</li>



<li>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/octopath-traveler-0-hands-on-way-more-than-just-a-mobile-game-remake.1287462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I can’t say I expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423">much from <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>. I’ve long admired the HD-2D role-playing game series but each new entry eventually leaves me cold. All of the pieces are there but they don’t solidify into an experience that’s more than the sum of its grindy, retro-infused parts. So I was surprised by just how much I immediately clicked with Square Enix’s latest tribute to the genre’s pixel art golden age.</p> <p>It probably helped that the demo I played last weekend at PAX West pushed me right to the brink of failure in a tough boss fight I ultimately only survived after all of my healing items were depleted and only one party member was still barely left standing. Some fans have worried about <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> being based on a mobile game that came out several years ago called <em>Champions of the Continent</em>. While Square Enix <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459">already confirmed the gacha gameplay elements</a> have been stripped out from this remake (the story has also been reworked), I can confirm, based on what I played at least, that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> doesn’t feel like an obviously <em>lesser</em> entry in the series.</p> <p>My roughly 30 minutes with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> was what anyone familiar with the old-school, turn-based RPG series would expect: I ran around town, fought enemies in a desert, and eventually made my way through a brief, cavernous dungeon peppered with treasure chests and dead ends to the boss fight within. The HD pixel art with soft focus backgrounds is still pretty and effective nostalgia bait, and the music in the section of the game I got to play was exceptional.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622694"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622694">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>But my demo did highlight two of the main features that set <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em><em>&nbsp;</em>apart from its predecessors. The first is a settlement sim mini-game in which you get to rebuild a town burned down at the start of the game from scratch. This includes both structures that impact aspects of your recovery efforts and the village’s development, like how many villagers come to live with you and the kinds of resources they harvest, as well as purely cosmetic features like cobblestone roads, trees, and benches.</p> <p>You gather materials out in the world and build stuff by placing objects on a square grid. While I didn’t get much time to play around with how these systems interact with one another over time, it’s easy to see how the settlement sim elements offer another avenue of satisfying progression that will directly benefit the rest of your party on your travels. Combined with all of the characters you’re meeting and collecting on your adventure, it all feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-1-2-hd-collection-review-rpg-features-ps1-1851767870">a bit <em>Suikoden</em>-coded</a> in the best way.</p>

 <p>Speaking of parties, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> lets you wander the world with eight instead of just four. During combat, half are relegated to a back row while the rest take turns attacking on the frontlines. Whenever it’s someone’s turn you can swap them with their buddy in the back if you need to take advantage of a different skill to exploit an enemy’s weakness or increase survivability for an upcoming onslaught. Even though they don’t get to act from the back row, these members of your party still boost the squad with free health restoration, skill points, and Boost Points at regular intervals.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000622695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622695">Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The result is combat that feels a lot busier but also more dynamic. Maybe someone in the back row has full BP so you swap them in to unleash a super attack and stun an opponent. Or you need the dancer to come out and buff the team before swapping her out with the spear guy who can target the enemy’s weakness. It speeds combat up and also creates a satisfying second layer of party management. For me it hit a sweet spot that the level of in-combat decision making in other <em>Octopath Traveler</em> games hasn’t always managed to.</p> <p>Out December 4 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> seemed like a stop-gap release aimed squarely at existing hardcore fans while they wait for Square Enix’s Team Asano to eventually deliver <em>Octopath Traveler 3</em>. But as an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>sympathizer who’s long been <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-ii-impressions-rpg-partitio-osvald-1850179725">on the fence about the series</a>, my hands-on time convinced me this might finally be the one to break my skepticism.</p>

              <p>This console generation has been notable for many reasons, from the scarcity during a covid-era launch through to the unprecedented scale of failures and studio closures, but one aspect that’s more bizarre to see than any other is the continual <em>increase</em> in prices. Historically midway through a generation we would see prices start to drop—this time, however, we’ve only seen the cost go up. And now in an astonishing move, it’s looking like Sony might be downgrading the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.</p> <p>While currently only affecting customers in Europe, the situation appears to be that the narrower PlayStation 5 Digital’s storage will be reduced from 1TB to 825GB, with the price remaining the same. That’s a price which, notably, has already been increased twice since launch. This is what’s being reported by billbil-kun on the French site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471"><em>Dealabs</em></a>, based on information from <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">certification documents</a>&nbsp;that show the next version of the discless PS5 in Europe, the <span dir="auto">CFI-2116 model, will maintain the current €499 ($580) price, but lose 20 percent of its storage capacity. This is currently only affecting the digital PS5; the version with a disc drive is as yet unchanged.</span></p> <p>That €499 price, it should be noted, is €100 ($116) more expensive than the PS5 was at launch, after two €50 increases since 2020. In the U.S., the console has also increased in price. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-tariff-sony-pro-xbox-unit-sales-earnings-1851780593">Sony warned in May</a> that Trump’s implementation of tariffs would likely cause costs to increase, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">last month that happened</a>. The PS5 Digital, which launched at $400, is now only available as the PS5 Slim at $500 (originally $450), though at least it still comes with a full terabyte of storage.</p>

 <p>Of course, any of this could change at any time. In previous generations, at around the four-to-five year mark in a console’s lifespan, we’d usually be seeing prices dropping on original builds, perhaps alongside a tweaked version at the original launch price. As such, it’s been weird enough to see this reversed, let alone then learning that new versions of the machines might become <em>worse</em> instead of better.</p> <p>825GB is far too little space in 2025. The PS5 Digital originally launched with that as its standard storage, before the “Slim” version replaced it in 2023 and upgraded things to 1TB. But given Sony’s software already takes up a huge chunk of the drive, that only leaves 667GB on an 825GB disc for your use. Given AAA games are routinely coming in around 150GB these days, you’re left with room for maybe four or five big titles? That’s&nbsp;<em>terrible</em>.</p> <p>But console manufacturers are clearly hurting when it comes to hardware revenue, given most are notoriously sold at cost or at a loss, and with tariff confusion and reality deeply hurting markets, there’s obviously a desire to shave costs wherever it’s possible. Putting the price of the console up a third time in five years in Europe is probably too big of an ask, so cutting corners could well be the next option. Which sucks. Big time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-won%E2%80%99t-be-influenced-by-mario-kart-world.1287456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sonic Series Producer has stated that Mario Kart World did not influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds in any way. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds launches this month on September 25, 2025. Ahead of the release, players will be able to try the game through an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-getting-free-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open network test</a> scheduled for mid-September. Ahead of that, the developers have revealed how Mario Kart World had no impact on their upcoming title’s development plans.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-did-not-influence-sonic-racing-crossworlds-development-plans">Mario Kart World Did Not Influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds Development Plans</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/sonic-series-producer-was-surprised-by-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/09/02/sonic-team-boss-mario-kart-world-wont-have-any-influence-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), Sonic Series Producer Takashi Iizuka spoke about Mario Kart World’s impact on Sonic Racing CrossWorlds. Izuka first stated that, like everyone, they are also unaware of the “road map of Mario Kart titles” and were “surprised” when it was released. At the same time, the developers were expecting one to be released soon, as Nintendo “typically” releases a new karting title with new hardware.</p>



<p>However, Iizuka added, “Whether or not Mario Kart was going to be released, our goal was to develop the best kind of Sonic racing title. That hasn’t changed – Mario Kart World won’t have any influence.” Izuka also spoke about the differences between the two games, which include cross-play, a customizable gadget system, characters from other IPs, Travel Rings, and more. </p>



<p>He stated that these features add “depth to the racing and are something other kart racers aren’t doing.” Izuka concluded, saying, “Even though Mario Kart World was announced, it didn’t influence our development plans.”</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-full-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete character list</a> has been revealed, including launch, season pass, and bonus characters.

And while Helldivers 2 remains immensely popular, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani has indicated that his team has had trouble adjusting the game because the majority of players aren't offering any feedback about it.</p><p>"The vast, vast majority silently play the game--they don't post here or on Reddit," wrote Joriani on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1411450096058368114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-ceo-says-the-vast-majority-of-people-silently-play-the-shooter-which-means-the-devs-cant-just-look-at-reddit-and-what-streamers-are-saying-for-feedback-this-is-a-challenge-for-all-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "When we do good, we [see] this in the stats. And when we don't, we also see it--sometimes it overlaps with what influencers or people say in social media--often it does not. So we use different tools to calibrate our compass."</p><p>Jorjani noted that the developers do listen to feedback from Helldivers 2 players who stream their games. However, he feels that they represent "the play style of a minority," while also setting "standards for many as they have a platform to broadcast and many who look." Ultimately, Joriani indicated that Arrowhead makes changes and fixes by balancing out external feedback with "a lot of data, metrics. and qualitative data."</p><p>Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, which is apparently attributed to the influx of Xbox gamers.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/">Ubisoft shut down The Crew servers</a> in March 2024, making the game unplayable since it requires an online connection. That means owners of the game couldn't even check out the single-player campaign. This led to a couple of fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-facing-lawsuit-after-the-crew-was-removed-from-platforms/1100-6527713/">filing a lawsuit against Ubisoft over The Crew situation</a>. In the aftermath of the uproar, Ubisoft has announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-anger-over-first-games-shutdown-the-crew-2s-new-offline-mode-detailed/1100-6531111/">offline modes are on the way for The Crew 2 and The Crew: Motorfest</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a Stop Killing Games movement that started after The Crew was shut down. In July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-addresses-the-stop-killing-games-movement/1100-6533318/">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot was asked about the campaign</a> during a shareholders meeting. "And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever," said Guillemot at the time. "But that's an issue that we're working on. That's something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crew originally launched in late 2014 on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360. The game then received two expansions: Wild Run and Calling All Units.

                <p>Earlier this summer, developer Wargaming shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-2-0-adds-tier-xi-tanks-new-pve-campaign-and-more-next-month/1100-6534078/" data-ref-id="1100-6534078">the first look at World of Tanks 2.0</a>, a massive update that may be the biggest one to date for the 15-year-old game. Now, the 2.0 update is live and players can dive into a new story-driven PvE mode and take out 16 new Tier XI tanks for a test drive on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTEkzHeiafg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FTEkzHeiafg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the other changes to the game include a redesigned hanger and user interface, an upgraded matchmaker, and "a comprehensive rebalance of hundreds of vehicles." A new Scandinavian map, Nordskar, will be the site of the PvE Event, "Operation Boiling Point." That's where players can try out three different Tier XI tanks.</p><p>Wargaming has also stated that the sound upgrades will include "heavier, more authentic tank sounds recorded from real vehicles." The developer is also rewarding longtime players who started before the 2.0 update with one full tech-tree branch (Tier VI–X), 2,500 Gold,15,000 Bonds, 10 million Credits, and 60 days of premium access.</p><p>Players who join after today's update will also get a few freebies, including two full tech-tree branches (Tier VI–X), three premium tanks, 60 days of premium, 6 million credits, and more. There are also exclusive awards waiting for players who already own all of the Tier VI–X vehicles. Every player who logs in from now to mid-October will receive "epic gifts," according to Wargaming.</p>

                <p>Video game consoles typically become cheaper the longer they've been on the market, but the current generation has been the exception to that rule due to various factors. Over in Europe, prospective PS5 owners might have to settle for a Sony console that offers less, as it has been reported that the internal SSD capacity is being shrunk so that Sony can avoid raising the price of the hardware yet again.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to leaker Billbil-kun</a>, the PS5 Digital Edition SSD will shrink from 1TB to 825GB starting with the next console chassis-E revision when it's available to purchase on September 13. As Billbil-kun noted, PS5 Digital Edition consoles originally sold for €399 when they launched in 2020, with the price increasing to €449 and €499 (around $582) eventually. The regular PS5 console with a disc drive is expected to retain its 1TB SSD.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨 UPCOMING RELEASE 🚨<br>PS5 Slim Chassis E (CFI-2100) is dropping soon...<br>But there's a catch 👀<br>📉 Digital Edition will come with less SSD storage<br>Full details below 🔽<a href="https://t.co/JTzhQ0alKV" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/JTzhQ0alKV</a></p>  — billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This year has been expensive for anyone looking to purchase a PS5 console.

            <p>
We've all heard the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> story by now: controversial launch followed by, as commenters often put it, the greatest redemption arc in the history of gaming. Somewhat remarkably, developer Hello Games' exploratory space sim has now received almost forty major updates since its launch in 2016, all helping No Man's Sky turn its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">into "Very Positive" on Steam</a>. But earlier this week, shortly after the arrival of its Voyagers update, No Man's Sky hit another incredible milestone, reaching its highest Steam player count since its launch nine years ago.
</p>
<p>
Following a peak of 212K Steam players on its initial release (as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max">per SteamDB</a>), No Man's Sky's numbers gradually sunk to a low of around 1K by March 2018. But just a few months later, buoyed on by its massive Next update, the game saw its highest Steam player count since 2016, peaking at 97,723. Subsequent releases have continued to increase interest in the procedural space sim, but none have been as enthusiastically received as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">last week's Voyagers update</a>. Player numbers climbed quickly after its arrival, until Monday when, with much of the US off work for Labour Day, they finally reached their highest point since August 2016, with 98,285 Steam players exploring the universe concurrently. It was an impressive moment - especially for a game that's ten next year.

Hello Games boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962598264387108899">celebrated the occasion on social media</a> with his customary exploding head emoji, but has now discussed No Man's Sky's recent success in more detail with Eurogamer. "Most of the time you are working on a game or an update, and you have no idea how it'll be received," Murray explained. "Often during development you lose perspective, and you can't see the wood for the trees. With Voyagers though, even from the earliest days it was obvious there was something really special about just flying around in a ship you built with your friends. It's just something that we've all seen glimpses of in other games, but there's a certain magic about exploring the universe in your own USS Enterprise or Millennium Falcon."
</p><p>
"It has also been one of the hardest things our team has undertaken," Murray continued. "We are still a small team, and this has been a really ambitious feature to add to a game that was released nearly a decade ago. Over the last year we were never fully sure if we could pull it off. I know my name is associated with No Man's Sky, but really it's the team - I couldn't be prouder of what they've managed to achieve. I'm so happy that it's getting the reaction that it has. Many of us have worked on this game for years, or were here for launch - and I genuinely feel the team really deserve this, they've earned it."

<p>
Voyagers is No Man's Sky's 38th major update and heralds the arrival of fully customisable Corvette-class ships. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">last year's Orbital update</a> introduced a spaceship editor, providing the tools to construct standard-scale vessels for solo occupants, Voyagers takes things to a whole new level. Corvettes allow for an impressive degree of design flexibility, giving players the means to create elaborate - and potentially huge - multi-crew ships, featuring navigable multi-level interiors built from a range of differently themed parts. These can then be further embellished by bolting functional systems and cosmetic components to the exterior for complete personalisation. 
</p>
<p>
About the only wrinkle to all this is the slightly convoluted way parts are acquired in standard mode, meaning it's not quite as simple as dropping into a hangar and designing your dream ship. But that hasn't stopped No Man's Sky players (some using Creative Mode, admittedly) from whipping up a range of incredibly striking Corvettes already. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/">the game's wonderfully chill subreddit</a>, there's evidence of everything from the virtually inevitable - Millennium Falcons, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n73rgn/corvette_star_destroyerish_build/">Star Destroyers</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n7bs9y/bringing_back_the_classics_corvette_style_no/">TARDIS</a> - to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n48azw/space_pirate_time/">space galleons</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n69fmc/my_masterpiece_corvette_the_capitol/">elaborate floating cities</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n3hacg/flew_to_gotham_jacked_some_guy_in_a_gimp_suit/">Batmobile</a>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n4wxi7/i_finally_created_my_dream_ship_the_10497/">classic Lego Space Explorer</a>, even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n4ec82/no_mans_discish/">Discword itself</a>, drifting through the universe on four turtle-mounted almost-elephants.

Murray himself shared a fan's <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962866703399821490">Formula 1 space-racer</a>, and I'm particularly partial to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmcrRQCy0DU">pilotable tropical island</a>, which is virtually unrecognisable as a ship when parked in water. My design efforts look a little tragic by comparison!

But back to Murray and the team at Hello Games. "It's been a crazy twelve months for us," he continued to Eurogamer. "We've launched Worlds Part I and Part II, as well as Voyagers in that time. All huge updates that have really changed No Man's Sky inside and out. Meanwhile Light No Fire is incredibly busy behind the scenes. It's exciting and fun, I've never worked on a team that is this productive and creative. There's a buzz to it day to day, but it's also hard work. We're deep in the trenches right now, fixing issues and fighting fires. And god, it's been a long journey! So these moments, seeing so many folks enjoying the game, seeing us hit big numbers, it's really meaningful. We don't take it for granted. It's the most important thing to us."

            <p>Gameplay footage for the cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a> has emerged online over a decade since the games cancellation. The gameplay has been suddenly uploaded onto an otherwise desolate YouTube channel called "David Halsted".</p>
<p>Gameplay footage uploaded includes a playthrough of the demo, the game's opening, a flythrough of the Undercity, a chase prototype and a combat segment titled "agile combat" which shows a gunfight in-action.</p>
<p>Prey 2 was in development back in the 2010's by Human Head under Bethesda, though work on the game stopped in 2011 with the game close to an alpha state according to Human Head co-founder Chris Rhinehart.</p>

<p>After a bizarre situation where development shifted away from Human Head and some reported contractual shenanigans, the game was officially cancelled in 2014. This came via <a href="http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/10/prey-2-officially-cancelled-bethesda/">a statement by Pete Hines who stated</a>: "It was a game we believed in, but we never felt that it got to where it needed to be…"</p><p>Many of those original Human Head developers would then get swallowed up by Zenimax Online Studios, developers of The Elder Scrolls Online.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved.1287414/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Octopath Traveler 2 having been released in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">2023</a>, I did not expect to see a new entry in the series that made HD-2D popular anytime soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Back in July</a>, however, Square Enix surprised fans of the series worldwide with the announcement of Octopath Traveler 0, a new game which isn't a proper sequel to its predecessors, but a sort of new and improved take on the story elements and gameplay ideas seen in the mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent as well as some brand new gameplay mechanics, such as town building mechanics that will allow players to rebuild their hometowns and customize it with a ton of visual customization options.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last month, I was given the chance to try out Octopath Traveler 0 before its release later this year, getting a taste of both the town building mechanics and the gameplay loop, which doesn't seem to stray too far from the classic JRPG loop featured in the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately, a total of around one hour wasn't enough to appreciate the finer details of the experience, and the few minutes I spent rebuilding the town weren't particularly impressive, as, aside from placing some buildings here and there, I couldn't experience how much choices would impact the development of the town and its inhabitants, although things seemed promising enough.</p>

<p>The second half of the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo, on the other hand, felt way more familiar and engaging. Set during one of the early story chapters, I was able to explore a beautiful and lively HD-2D town, interact with NPCs using the series' trademark Path Actions, which can have widely different outcomes depending on a variety of factors, and eventually proceed to a dungeon whose design is in line with the design of dungeons of the previous two entries in the series - a few alternate paths, but a generally straightforward design that easily prevents players from getting lost. As I explored the dungeon, I got into quite a few battles which felt instantly familiar, as the turn-based combat system of new entry in the series hasn't been changed a whole lot. As such, before long, I started hitting enemy weakpoints to Break and stun them, and Boost my characters to enhance the power of their skills to get rid of them in a single turn. The biggest change to the Octopath Traveler 0 combat experience is the bigger party size, eight members instead of four positioned in a front and back row, which I expect will open up a lot of interesting strategies and that is sure to influence enemy design considerably, since it will be easy to hit an enemy weakness with so many characters on hand. Having so many characters and widely diverse skills at my disposal, however, did not make the boss battle awaiting at the end of the dungeon any easier, so even those who mastered the previous two entries in the series should find plenty to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>Thrown into the middle of the adventure with little to no knowledge of skills and synergies for eight different characters, playing the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo felt overwhelming, at times, but as soon as I got a little more acquainted with them, I was hooked once again. With the game's Job system promising to deliver the usual excellent customization features the series is known for, and plenty of unknowns regarding story, characters and the town building mechanics, which still managed to show promise in a short one hour session, I cannot wait to sit down and spend more time with what it setting out to be a more than worthy new entry in the series when it launches on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that another retro N64 game is coming to Nintendo Switch Online tomorrow, and if you're a fan of relatively obscure 90s shooters, you're in for a treat with this one.</p>

<p>As revealed by a brand new trailer, the latest N64 title to come to Switch Online is none other than&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>, the Nintendo 64 version of a game that was also released for PC and the original PlayStation in 1998.</p>

<p>Indeed, this isn't the first time Acclaim's FPS has been re-released; back in 2018, as part of its 20th anniversary, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">tireless</a> retro <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">stewards</a> Nightdive released a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em>, complete with support for modern hardware, a new automap feature, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online-shooting.jpg?itok=gueTtUR7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online-shooting.jpg?itok=pW3UCucT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>will soon be available on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>This being Nintendo Switch Online, however, the version you're getting here isn't Nightdive's remaster; rather, it's an upscaled version of the original N64 game, so if you prefer your retro re-releases faithful to the originals, then this one's for you.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>is only available as part of Nintendo Switch Online's 18+ collection, so if the age on your account is lower than that, you won't be able to play it even if you are signed up for Switch Online.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">other</a> N64 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">titles</a> on Switch Online, you also won't be able to check this one out if you're not signed up for the Expansion Pack addon, so make sure to grab that if this is a game you want to play on your Switch.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off exactly what you can expect from<em>&nbsp;Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p><em>Forsaken 64&nbsp;</em>will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online catalog tomorrow, so if you're tired of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">that other game with the same release date</a>, you know where to head.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4.1287408/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a lot of words you could use to describe Randy Pitchford. The sometimes controversial, always energetic Gearbox CEO is often his studio's biggest cheerleader, and it comes off as earnest, which isn't something you can say about a lot of CEOs.</p>

<p>That passionate commitment to his craft really came through when we chatted with him and narrative director Sam Winkler on the show floor at PAX West. A <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room punctuated the conversation with loud smashes, but honestly, that level of mayhem felt so on brand.</p>

<p>We asked Pitchford and Winkler about the efforts that went into <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s endgame this time around, along with what they think worked for fan-favorite DLC characters like Krieg and Gaige, especially in light of the newly confirmed DLC character.</p>



<h2><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Biggest Hype Man</h2>

<p>It's been six years now since Pitchford, Winkler, and the team started working on the newest <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/borderlands" rel="nofollow">Borderlands</a> </em>game.</p>

<p>"This is a non-trivial percentage of my life," Pitchford said. "I wouldn't trade it for the world. For us, this is literally our lives. And we don't fuck around. Everything in the game is because someone did something. A human being put their heart and soul and sweat and tears into trying to do the best they did. It's not AI making this shit."</p>

<p><em>Borderlands </em>isn't just something that Pitchford creates to satisfy the bottom line. There's genuine joy when he talks about the game. That bleeds into when he talks about development, because he knows that a more fun game will be a better product for the end consumer—including himself.</p>

<p>That was evident when I asked him and Winkler about their favorite Vault Hunter to play as in the upcoming iteration. Part of me expected a diplomatic "I couldn't choose my favorite child" response without detail, but instead, I got a meaningful answer that sounded like these two were genuinely excited to play the game, even after countless hours of play testing.</p>



<p>"When I started, I thought I was just going to be Vex for life, and then when Rafa came online, I started messing around with that," Pitchford said. "But as I'm coming into launch, what I've been playing over the last few weeks, it's all been Harlowe." In fact, he has a ritual where he'll try to 100% the game when it releases, and he plans to do that with the Gravitar herself.</p>

<p>Winkler, on the other hand, has had to focus on the narrative whenever he plays an internal build, so he couldn't really savor the character he really wants to play: Amon, the Forgeknight who plays like an elemental space viking.</p>

<p>"I knew from talking to the character designers and constant back-and-forth meetings about this, they're like, 'Oh, this character's more technical' so I'm going to have to pay close attention while I'm playing," Winkler said. "So I'm reserving it. This is my treat at the end of the road."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've been working on <em>Borderlands </em>for over 20 years. I'm starting to get pretty good at it." —Randy Pitchford</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Crafting the Perfect Endgame</h2>

<p>Historically, the franchise has responded and adjusted well to new player patterns and tastes. Case in point, one of the big changes to <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is the ability to create new characters starting at level 30 once you beat the campaign.</p>

<p>"We have actual telemetry that kind of informs us that look, for a lot of players that complete the main game, the deterrent from trying other characters is starting over," Pitchford said. "And starting them with an endgame-viable baseline can let them explore more."</p>

<p>"And respects their time," Winkler added.</p>

<p>Of course, getting to max level is a whole other ball game. Pitchford cautiously said that on average, there's likely more play time getting to level 50 than there is getting to level 30. Though of course, that depends on what you do to gather XP.</p>



<p>The biggest change for endgame this time around, however, is their internal approach. From the start, Creative Director Graeme Timmins has kept the endgame in mind, specifically because he's always been the one to work on it post-launch for other <em>Borderlands </em>games.</p>

<p>"If you want the kitchen to be clean, you get the guy that has to clean up the mess to manage the kitchen while it's cooking," Pitchford said.</p>

<p>He also admitted that yes, previous iterations have taken some wild swings for the endgame, but with iteration comes increased precision, taking them closer and closer to a bullseye. This time around, the key focus is riding that thin line between ensuring gear is always viable while there's always another piece out there that's a little bit better.</p>

<p>"We used to kind of invalidate loot a lot, and I think it's better to not invalidate loot but to not kill the loot chase," Pitchford said. "So we had to design it so that you can have both living almost paradoxically on top of each other."</p>

<p>Another big part of the endgame that Pitchford and Winkler were excited about was the proficiency system, which introduces more reasons to continue playing after rolling credits. There are challenges involved that keeps things interesting, like killing a certain number of enemies or a more difficult iteration of an enemy.</p>

<p>"Tying some of the progression in the endgame to specific challenges to me makes the hunt more interesting than just 'number go up,'" Winkler said.</p>

<p>"You have completionist mindset and progression mindset working together, which is really kind of a fun kind of psychology," Pitchford added.</p>



<h2>Player Feedback &amp; Gameplay Data</h2>

<p>There are two big factors that Gearbox considers as they iterate on their games: player feedback and gameplay data. The folks at Gearbox have a good finger on the pulse of their community—though admittedly, the community does make it easy.</p>

<p>"One thing that we can count on from our audience is they're not going to hold back," Pitchford said. "If they have opinions, we will hear about them. But we love them."</p>

<p>Winkler said that with modern game development, launch is often just the start of things, as that opens the door to the biggest QA session they'll ever have. In this case, it's all about the data they get on the back end while players, well, do their thing.</p>

<p>"They're going to break our shit," Pitchford said.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Winkler responded. "And we can respond super fast. We get instant feedback and we can make it as good as possible because we've got people like Graeme and Grant [Kao, Associate Creative Director]."</p>



<p>By analyzing the telemetry, like they did for determining the need for endgame-viable new characters, the studio can see what needs fixing, tweaking, and updating. It's a lot of data to sift through, but with all those data points, it's easy to see what's breaking the game and what's breaking the player.</p>

<p>"When we have millions and millions of players playing the game—let's say there's 5 million people playing—that 1% of god-roll player, well guess what? That's now 50,000 people that are just fucking crushing because they got the shit," Pitchford said. " t's really wild how the edge cases are massive numbers of people when you have the game launch at the scale."</p>

<h2>Crafting a New DLC Vault Hunter</h2>

<p>Just last week, the team confirmed that it's working on a new DLC Vault Hunter for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. It's a shift from their 4-character strategy for <em>Borderlands 3</em>. which was primarily driven by data showing that players mainly stuck with one character.</p>

<p>Of course, the level 30 starting point seems like the new way to combat that barrier while satisfying the huge demand for DLC characters. After the popularity of Gaige and Krieg from <em>Borderlands 2</em>, it's no surprise that people are clamoring for more.</p>



<p>"One of the reasons why I think both Krieg and Gaige went well is because we didn't have the same stakes for them that we had for the main characters," Pitchford said. "We could actually fuck around. Krieg would never work as a main playable, because the gameplay style is so weird. But because it's so weird and interesting, it kind of resonates."</p>

<p>There's a lot that goes into a new Vault Hunter. They need to be relatable, have a worthy backstory, look exciting, play well—in other words, they need to be iconic. It's a lot of pressure, especially with Gaige and Krieg setting the bar high. But Pitchford is confident that he and his team have found something good with this upcoming character.</p>

<p>"There's a certain point where—and that's when you kind of know it's going to work—where the character stops being this thing we're making. And then the character is like, it's there now. Now it's telling us what it's going to do and who it needs to be," Pitchford said.</p>



<p>"I'm feeling the genesis of it, and I'm really kind of pumped about it. I love that moment when it shifts from being the thing that we're trying to make to oh, now it's got a life of its own. It's going to tell us what it's going to feel and say and do. I love that."</p>

<p>For Winkler, who oversees a lot of the scripts for these characters, that magical moment happens when the voice actor nails what that character should sound like.</p>

<p>"For me, it's the moment where we get the actor in the booth, and it's like, OK, this could work on a page or at a table read. And then someone spins my fucking flack into gold and goes, oh, there it is. And now I get to go back and rewrite all this stuff because I've got the voice in my head."</p>

              <p>In a world where (almost) everything exists online, it’s more important than ever to keep your privacy secure: That’s where a VPN (or <em>Virtual Private Network</em>) comes in. <strong>It’s your own personal internet bodyguard</strong>: It keeps your data under lock and key and your online behavior hidden from hackers, trackers and even your internet company. Of all the VPNs available, NordVPN is the world’s top service.</p> <p>NordVPN has a few very cheap plans that are really good: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/"><em>Basic</em> plan only costs around $3.09 per month (down from $11,59 per month) if you subscribe for two years</a>. f you want something with a bit more bells and whistles, the Plus package is the most popular choice: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">about $3.99 monthly (down from $14.99) with the same two-year subscription</a> and comes with some handy add-ons that are nice to have if you want to get the most out of your VPN experience. Both of them are <strong>73% off the original price</strong> right now.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p> <h2>Safe and Secure Connection</h2> <p>NordVPN <strong>makes your connection very safe with military-grade encryption</strong>&nbsp;so your data is encrypted and no one can view it. And <strong>they don’t keep logs</strong> so your browsing history stays just that – yours, and not on their servers or tracked. If you require an extra level of protection, NordVPN offers a Double VPN feature that routes your connection through two servers for double encryption.</p>

 <p>The Plus plan adds even more protection in its Threat Protection Pro (similar to an antivirus software) which prevents annoying ads, trackers and malware that slow you down or invade your privacy. It also has NordPass which is a decent password manager (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-password-managers" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">check out Gizmodo’s list here</a>) that helps you store and keep your passwords safe so you don’t have to remember them. And if you worry about how many devices you can protect, <strong>NordVPN’s got you set with up to 10 simultaneous connections</strong>.</p> <p>Speed also matters when you go for a VPN, isn’t it? With <strong>over 7,000 servers spread across more than 120 sites worldwide</strong>, NordVPN gives you fast and reliable connectivity wherever you go. This makes streaming and gaming smooth and uninterrupted. You will not need to suffer from lags or buffering.</p>

 <p>If you’re still not convinced, no problem: <span><strong>NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong></span>. Try it, test it out with no obligation. If you don’t enjoy it, simply get your money back.</p> <p>And if you want to save even more or be able to customize your protection, NordVPN has other options too—from Basic to Complete and Prime—that give you options with additional features like encrypted cloud storage and identity theft protection. But in the end, for great privacy and security at a cost that won’t hurt the budget, NordVPN’s Basic (and Plus) plan is where it’s at.</p> <p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-global-release-times-confirmed">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release date</a> of September 4, 2025, delivered in a brief trailer two weeks ago, was amazing, celebratory news for Silksong fans who had been waiting for such news for over six years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was a far less celebratory day for the developers of around 10 other video games with existing marketing plans to launch right around that same time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ensuing weeks, the list of games that have moved their release dates for Silksong has only grown longer as developers reconfigure marketing plans and find new dates that work. As of this piece’s publication, that list includes Demonschool, Aeterna Lucis, Little Witch in the Woods, CloverPit, Megabonk, Baby Steps, Faeland, Starbirds, and Moros Protocol. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2837590/view/534359257319997765" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</u></a>, an indie game with no release date plans anywhere in sight, elected to delay its Kickstarter launch and demo release due to Silksong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But is it actually the right decision to move a smaller game out of the way of a bigger one? What if your small game is so different from the big game that you could stand to set up a Barbenheimer situation? What if GTA 6 stealth launches tomorrow?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both GTA and Silksong have prompted plenty of discussion this year about what devs can and should do when their game suddenly shares a release date with a juggernaut. So I asked a couple of experts about the thought process behind setting and moving release dates, and what they think the right choice is when GTA 6, Silksong, or another marketing monster drops into your launch window unexpectedly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Delay?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Just deciding on a video game’s release date in the first place can be one heck of a puzzle, I’m told. The game has to be ready, for starters, it has to be able to make it through the complex platform certification process. You have to make sure, if you’re a publisher with multiple games, that none of those games are stepping on one another’s toes. You want to avoid seasonal sales on storefronts like Steam, because you won’t get visibility during that time. You want to speak with platform partners to ensure the time makes sense for them. And you have to deal with all sorts of other factors: maybe a developer is going on vacation a week you want to release and need them to be there for bug fixes. Maybe someone on the team is getting married. Maybe the developer just really likes Tuesdays!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with all that work put into just finding a date in the first place, moving to an entirely different date sounds like a terrible idea, right? Well, Adam Lieb says it often is. Lieb is the CEO of marketing platform Gamesight. A big part of Lieb’s job is to work together with developers and publishers to plan marketing around their games, and he tells me he’s worked on over a thousand different games in the last five years, largely on PC and console.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which all means that Lieb, as a part of his job, makes recommendations on when publishers and developers should release their games. And while there are many factors to consider, including competition, Lieb says he doesn’t always advise devs to delay if a big game appears in their existing launch window. Why? Simply put, delays are expensive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The most boring business reason is that every day your game is ready to launch, and you don't launch it, it's costing you money,” he says. “The game is ready. You could be generating revenue on that game… If it's going to be the difference between game success and failure, of course you should always do it, but when that's not the case, you're just talking about wasting a bunch of costs that you shouldn't be spending to push something like three months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But pure cost isn’t the only reason Lieb doesn’t always advise moving games. He tells me that a lot of the conventional wisdom for why someone might move a game out of another game’s launch window doesn’t apply in every case. For instance, is it a good idea to release an indie platformer shortly after Silksong comes out? You’d think it’s not, but Lieb proposes something different:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you have an indie platformer, a great time to launch it is probably, I don't know, two to six weeks after Silksong comes out. You've got probably a brand new audience that's playing that style game either for the first time, because it's a huge game, or they haven't played it in a long time, or it's their favorite genre, it doesn't really matter. You've got more people playing indie platformers during that time. [Silksong] probably doesn't have a thousand hours of content. People are going to play it for 20 to 40 hours, or something like that. Then they're going to be looking for the next game to play. So, if you have a game that is in the same space, you actually do kind of want to be around their launch window, maybe even before.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an example, Lieb mentions the original Splitgate, which he recalls came out right before a big Halo update and benefitted from Halo fans excited about the update and wanting to play something like it right away. We also discuss The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered’s shadow-drop earlier this year, and its launch extremely close to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Both games are RPGs, yet both sold well — perhaps, Lieb suggests, in part because excitement for one fed directly into interest in the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Analyzing those close comparisons is another big part of Lieb’s job. When working with a game, he looks at data to determine what other games players “index” for, so that developers can avoid competition or, alternatively, play off interest. For instance, if Gamesight was working on Borderlands 4 (hypothetically — Lieb and I did not discuss this particular game at all), he might look at what games players of Borderlands 3 also played around the same time, and then advise Gearbox to steer clear of any sequels or similar releases with Borderlands 4. And sometimes, games that index high are not what you’d expect, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>Palworld players indexing highly for Helldivers 2</u></a>, or are driven more by content creator trends than similar genres or gameplay or anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lies of P did so much better in the post-Elden Ring world because there was this huge influx of Souls players, and then they came off of it, it was almost like a warm audience, and then there's a new game in the genre,” Lieb shares as an example. “People were hungry for more of that type of game, and then that type of game appears, and it was actually great for them.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Out of the Way, and Getting Over It</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieb provides me with compelling reasons why delaying a game may not always be the best idea, even if GTA 6 is approaching rapidly in your rear view mirror. But Nigel Lowrie, co-founder of Devolver Digital, which is publishing Silksong-delayed Baby Steps, had a more breezy take on delaying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lowrie says he walked into 2025 fully prepared to delay Baby Steps or whatever else if he needed to; GTA in particular was “blinding” as he looked at the calendar ahead — at least until it was delayed to 2026. And Silksong wasn’t the only indie game of concern, either. He was wary of Deltarune, and continues to keep an eye on ConcernedApe’s The Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Silksong, he continues, was different. Silksong trended on social media during publisher showcases it wasn’t even in. He calls it a “cultural moment,” saying that the marketing itself is effectively part of the experience of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“People do enjoy Death Stranding 2,” Lowrie says. “But people spent probably more time or just as much time engaging with the marketing and promotion of Death Stranding 2 than they did [playing Death Stranding 2.]  And there's that sense of, that's part of the experience in a lot of ways. We'd likened it to Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones was this cultural moment and everyone watched Game of Thrones for an hour every week or whatever when it was on. But when I look back on my experience, I know my wife and I, we'd get in bed immediately and just speculate about next week. And it sounds silly, but really, we spent a lot of time engaged with that series or these games through speculation, hype, promotion… I'm not saying it's just as fun as playing the actual game, but it is part of the experience. And so you have to be mindful of those kinds of things too, when games reach that level people love talking about it along with actually playing the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the prospect of massive games like Silksong or GTA always ready to disrupt a calendar, Lowrie says he ensures he’s always ready to move a game. So when Silksong’s trailer hit, he chatted with the developers of Baby Steps — Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy — to see how they felt. They looked at how many people watched the Silksong trailer or were even just in the queue ahead of time, waiting for it to start. “That many people with a little video that was a minute and a half long, everyone assumed it had to be the release date, that's the only reason it would make that big a stink, and there were like hundreds of thousands of people waiting for it to start and you're like, that's important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The group came to the conclusion that Baby Steps could move, and so it did. He says he’s seen criticism online from those who think Baby Steps, or other games, should not have moved. But Lowrie says it’s different when it’s your game that your livelihood depends on. “You can't AB test reality,” he says. “Maybe Baby Steps would've just been fine September 8, it could have been. But am I willing to risk this team's livelihood and the future of the game they've worked on for five years to see if they both work out? I'm not. And I also want to listen to what they want, and what they want is to have their own spotlight and I couldn't agree more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for what it’s worth, Lieb agrees. Though he gave me many reasons not to delay a game, he also acknowledged there were many reasons to delay when GTA 6 or Silksong comes knocking, and the need to be in a media “spotlight” was one of them. There are only so many hours in the day, he says, and if every content creator is covering Silksong or GTA, your game is out of luck. “The day GTA comes out, all you can do is write stories about GTA because that's what people want to read about,” he says. “There might be content creators that love your game, and wish they could play it on launch day, but sorry, dude, can't.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GTA 6, the juggernaut</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong, both Lowrie and Lieb agree, is a big deal, and unique in the way it’s captured and consumed a massive portion of the gaming audience. But GTA 6, they said, was on another level even further beyond that. “I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands,” Lowrie says. Lieb’s take is similar: “I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieb adds that GTA 6 is so massive it’s impacting release date conversations even in genres far outside of what you’d normally consider GTA competition. “What's funny with GTA is, because we do a lot of genre analysis comparisons because of the RP servers, there ends up being almost every type [of game]. Someone’s built a horror GTA RP server or whatever, so that competes with Silent Hill somehow. And you obviously take that with a little bit of grain of salt, but the scope of that game is so large that it ends up competing with stuff that it otherwise wouldn't. Almost every other game, if you're a shooter, you don't care a lot about other things besides shooters. There are some things you maybe should be slightly cognizant of, but generally if you're a FPS, that's the genre you care about. But GTA has been this little bit of a black cloud that looms kind of over everything. So, that, I think, has caused people to be more hesitant with dates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why, both he and Lowrie tell me, so many developers and publishers steered clear of fall 2025 when they thought GTA 6 was releasing then. Once it moved, suddenly that period was safe again, and it filled up with releases. But we should expect everyone to give May 26, 2026 a wide berth. How wide, I ask Lowrie? He doesn’t know exactly just yet, though he says GTA 6’s ability to not need months upon months of aggressive marketing is helpful — none of his games are likely to cross streams with any big GTA 6 gameplay trailers or events. It’s just the release date that’s scary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask both of them about a Barbenheimer scenario or, more applicable to video games, a Doom/Animal Crossing scenario. Is there a game that could release alongside GTA 6 and succeed by virtue of being incredibly different? Neither of them are confident it could, and Lieb in particular says it’s a bad idea to risk it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The problem is if you are the head of marketing, head of publishing, whoever's trying to make this decision with the larger team, and you've got to put together a PowerPoint presentation that says our game is launching the same date, everyone's going to be like, ‘You're crazy.’ It doesn't mean that it's a bad idea, it just means it's super high risk, and it's going to be hard to get everyone to be on board, because if you're wrong, and it does blot out the sun, and no one's talking about any other games. No journalists are writing about any other games. No creators are creating content for any other games. And you look back, that's a career-defining bad decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6’s date is set now (as far as we know), so hopefully Lowrie and other developers and publishers won’t have to deal with any more surprises on the release date front for a while (at least until The Haunted Chocolatier and Hades 2 v1.0 get dates). But I do finish up by asking Lowrie what he recommends developers do when a massive game suddenly descends upon them, upending all their carefully-laid marketing plans. Lowrie notes that there are so many games coming out now, you’re almost guaranteed to share a release date with <em>someone. </em>And if it’s someone big, he prefers addressing it with both humor, and humility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's cool to know your place in the food chain and embrace it, it's fine. I am very proud of Devolver, but we know that we're not about to go up against juggernaut, GTA 6 or whatever, so just have fun with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Movie On the Way from Paramount]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-movie-on-the-way-from-paramount.1287375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has announced that it's working on a live-action&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, and the studio is promising to deliver what it calls "the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series".</p>

<p>In a press release, Paramount confirms its intention to make the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, pledging to honor "the brand's rich narrative and distinctive style" and to provide "an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have many more details than that; Paramount says the movie will be an "unforgettable cinematic event", and we know it'll be live-action, but beyond that, the studio, along with the franchise's publisher Activision, are remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=DSDJRxOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=g7qXN4QO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>is getting its first movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know, for example, whether Paramount's movie will adapt any of the existing&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games, or whether it'll be an all-new experience. There are also a range of time periods in which&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are set, so we don't know whether the movie will be a period piece or a more contemporary one.</p>

<p>We can, however, make an educated guess as to why the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie exists. Back in October last year, Activision revealed that the series as a whole had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">crossed 500 million units sold</a>, and that most recent release&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date.</p>

<p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are, however, also very expensive to make. In January, a report emerged which revealed that 2020's&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">cost an eye-watering $700 million</a>, which includes its initial release and subsequent live-service content additions.</p>

<p>It's worth bearing in mind that since&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>is five years old, budgets are likely to be even higher now, and so making a movie with Paramount makes sense as a way for Activision to bolster its coffers for future development.</p>




<p>Following on from last year's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next installment in the series,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>, is due to launch this November. Unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, it'll be set in the near future, and will also feature co-op play for its campaign.</p>

              <p>Summer is over. Sorry, folks. September is here, and even though the season doesn’t technically end until September 22, you and I both know that date is meaningless. Once August ends, I’m swapping my tank tops for flannels, drinking pumpkin spice lattes, and rewatching <em>Over the Garden Wall</em> again. And with summer ending, school is starting—a great time to save on a bunch of tech stuff with all the back-to-school sales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">Take this student laptop for instance. Normally priced at $1,400, this has dropped by 81%. That brings it under $300 to just $260 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>This student-ready laptop is working with a powerful Intel N150 processor with an integrated graphics card</strong>. This thing won’t be playing <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> with ultra-high settings or anything, but it’s perfectly capable of taking care of basic everyday task a student might need. Things like browsing the web, sending emails, drafting up essays, or building slideshows will be easy-peasy. It comes pre-installed with Window 11 Home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The laptop’s got 4GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. However, it does come with <strong>an extra 128GB in the form of a microSDXC card</strong> generously included. That’s 256GB of workable space.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>You also get a full year subscription to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>. That includes access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more. Plus with OneDrive, you can get even more storage on the cloud which you’ll be able to access anywhere from your other devices. Forgot to submit your paper, but you’re sitting in class with your laptop back in the dorm? Not a problem. Just pull it up on your phone and send it away.</p>
<p>The anti-glare display stretches across at 14 inches and is capable of a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. You can expand onto a second monitor over either USB-C or HDMI which can support resolutions of up to 4K at 60Hz. In addition to those ports, you get two USB-A ports and an audio jack.</p>



<p>Collaboration is easy with the built-in mic and HD 720p web camera which can record crisp and clear videos.</p>
<p>With a long battery life of up to 11 hours on a single charge, you can keep it running all day. You won’t need to bring your charger with your when taking your laptop out to all your classes for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">For a limited time, you can save 81% on the HP 14 student laptop</a>. The price is down to just $260 for back-to-school season and it even comes with a year of Microsoft Office 365.</p>

Despite the game's strong first month Tsujimoto said that the high price of Monster Hunter Wilds' "main platform," the PS5, was an "unexpectedly large" barrier to achieving this target.</p>

<p>The exec also pointed to the success of the Switch 2 and its moderate price to emphasize his point--though didn't say anything about the potential for a Switch 2 port for Wilds.</p><p>Tsujimoto is speaking mainly in the context of the Japanese market, where the cost of buying a PS5, including peripherals and subscriptions, comes close to 100,000 yen (around $670 USD). This price point is not easily reachable for young people, Tsujimoto says, adding that this is true in international markets as well as Japan.</p><p>By contrast, he mentions that the response to the Switch 2 was "better than we had expected" at 49,980 yen (around $335 USD), saying that this "reaffirmed the high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers."</p><p>After its strong first month, sales for Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">fell off dramatically</a>, with Capcom reporting only 477,000 copies sold between April 1 and June 30. While the cost of the PS5 may be a factor, the game has also suffered from performance issues, most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">heavily impacting PC players</a>.</p><p>Despite the steep decline, Monster Hunter Wilds is still far from a flop sales-wise--as of August 2, Monster Hunter Wilds was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025</a> in the US.

<p>These features include ambient-light detection and specific adjustments targeting the "unique needs" of live sports and gaming. The intelligent features also include a "Precision Black" feature that appears to be targeting viewer complaints that a lot of premium TV is too dark--saying Dolby Vision 2 can improve clarity of dark scenes "in any viewing environment without compromising artistic intent."</p><p>Dolby Vision 2 is also dipping its toes into the controversial world of motion smoothing, but Dolby claims its Authentic Motion feature will be "the world's first creative-driven motion control tool," and will serve to make content feel "more authentically cinematic without unwanted judder." Motion smoothing is notoriously unpopular with filmmakers, who have often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBLx4ctoX0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged consumers to turn off the feature</a> to avoid the dreaded "soap opera effect," so it will be interesting to see how Dolby's promised cinematic application of motion smoothing plays out in practice.</p><p>Dolby Vision 2 is still in its early days, but early adopters include Hisense, which will incorporate the new standard into its premium line of TVs, and on the content side, CANAL+ has said it will support Dolby Vision 2 in the content it distributes. TVs with Dolby Vision 2 incorporated will come in two tiers--the premium Dolby Vision 2 Max, which will include "additional premium features," and the standard Dolby Vision 2.</p><p>Dolby Vision is not widely supported in the gaming industry, but can be used with a growing list of games on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-gets-official-dolby-vision-support/1100-6496622/" data-ref-id="1100-6496622">Xbox Series X|S since support was added in 2021</a>. Dolby hasn't said anything about game-industry adoption of the new Dolby Vision 2 standard, but games that already support Dolby Vision will presumably see an improvement in quality if played on a Dolby Vision 2-enabled TV.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
