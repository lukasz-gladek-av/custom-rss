            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k25-release-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as who'll be on the wrestling sim's cover and what kind of new gameplay improvements you can expect.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will officially release across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, intriguingly enough) on March 14th, and if you pick up one of the game's two special editions, you can play it a week early.</p>

<p>The cover star is none other than "Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns. After&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K24</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k24-announced" rel="nofollow">WrestleMania Showcase focus</a>, the new game's Showcase mode will instead revolve around Reigns and the extended Anoa'i wrestling family, which also includes The Rock, Rikishi, and Jacob Fatu, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=5lOFox96 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=GDqDmiDq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WWE 2K25</em>'s cover star is Roman Reigns, and he's also heavily involved in the game's Showcase mode.</figcaption></figure><p>The Showcase mode will be titled The Bloodline's Dynasty, and it'll let you relive "historic showdowns" involving the extended Anoa'i family or "flip the script and change the outcome of select match-ups".</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will also introduce The Island, a hub featuring "a series of areas built around different WWE themes" in which you'll try to impress Reigns by completing a number of different challenges and tasks.</p>

<p>2K is boasting that&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will feature the largest roster of any&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>game to date; it'll feature over 300 wrestlers spanning multiple generations of WWE history, including the likes of Rey Mysterio, Chyna, and Bret "Hitman" Hart, plus more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to lots of new match types in&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25</em>, including intergender wrestling for the first time in the series' history, as well as new Underground Matches, the return of Chain Wrestling, and Bloodline Rules Matches.</p>




<p>Three different versions of the game will be available: <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-standard-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Standard</a>, <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-deadman-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadman</a>, and <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-the-bloodline-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloodline</a>.</p>

<p>The Standard version launches on March 14th, and it'll also get you cross-gen access, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. Meanwhile, Deadman and Bloodline both pack in extra goodies and launch a week early.</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>comes out on March 14th (or March 7th, depending on your edition) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878960/WWE_2K25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-PPSA22696_00-WWE2K25000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

When I'm back I will start working on the next Arrowhead game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilestedt was thrust into the headlines following Helldivers 2’s explosive launch in February 2024. Despite a raft of issues the cooperative shooter became PlayStation Studios’ fastest-selling game of all time, shifting 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Helldivers 2 is so successful that Sony is turning it into a movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilestedt himself became the face of Helldivers 2, often wading into discussion about the game’s qualities and failings across social media, Reddit threads, and Discord. In May last year, Pilestedt revealed that Helldivers 2’s enormous success had caused a problem for the studio: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-its-seen-a-horrifying-amount-of-threats-and-rude-behavior-from-some-in-the-community">more community toxicity than it had ever had to deal with before</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the release of Helldivers 2, Arrowhead had enjoyed big hits with the first Helldivers game and Magicka, but the success of Helldivers 2 raised the game and the studio’s profile. "The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G.biz</a>. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Helldivers 2 launched it faced significant server issues that made the game unplayable for many, sparking an initial backlash. Since then, Arrowhead has faced complaints about everything from weapon balance to low impact Premium Warbonds. But by far the biggest backlash was sparked by Sony’s controversial decision to force PC gamers to link to a PlayStation Network account to play. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but not before a review-bombing campaign savaged Helldivers 2 on Steam. Arrowhead community managers have said the PSN backlash caused staff to lose a week simply having to deal with the fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid Helldivers 2’s success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">Pilestedt changed his position from Arrowhead CEO to chief creative officer</a> so he could focus more on the studio’s games as well as its community. Replacing Pilestedt as Arrowhead CEO was Shams Jorjani, former executive at fellow Swedish games company Paradox and publisher of Magicka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no word on Helldivers 2’s next game, but it seems likely we won’t see it for some time. Meanwhile, Arrowhead continues to update Helldivers 2, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">the recent addition of third enemy faction the Illuminate breathing new life into the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Kentucky Route Zero is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, January 28, 2025. Below, we look back at its inspirations and excitement for experimentation.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It is in the details that Kentucky Route Zero stakes its claim beyond video games. Its typewriter typography. The terse descriptions of characters between bursts of dialogue. The adventure game actions written like stage directions. Lights that illuminate the new parts of a stage or set. It is the details that matter. In practice, KRZ doesn't play differently from any other adventure game, but it feels different than many of them. This is because it takes from a wide array of influences, many beyond the usual preview of video games. Its interest in theater, film, visual art, and radio is what still makes it a vivid game five years later.</p><p dir="ltr">It is no secret that video games can be a little self-obsessed. While one could meaningfully label a painting, a movie, or a book as "science-fiction" or "romantic," video game genre designations like "roguelike" or "platformer" can only really describe video games (though if any one wants write an essay about what novels could be described as "strategy" or "simulation," I would be very eager to read it). Many--even most--big-budget games borrow from a ready-made list of influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Indiana Jones, or Lord of the Rings. This narrow set of sources can make video games feel sometimes hyper-generic: unable to node themselves into a meaningful network, but instead digging deeper into an ever-drying well. When a big game attempts a big homage to genuine artistic legacy, it can feel absurd. Who could possibly take Ghost of Tsushima's "Kurosawa mode" seriously?</p><p dir="ltr">Though Kentucky Route Zero could be described as science-fiction, it is a quiet unnerving kind, drawing most obviously from the magical realism of writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Ricardo Piglia. It has stark artificiality, a stageness, that is clearly pulling on the theoretical and fictional work of Bertolt Brecht. It is, in a word, pretty far outside the regular span of video games. This results in something that can feel beguiling and strange in a way video games can often struggle to be, especially if you haven't read any of its inspirations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>This is not to say that KRZ is ashamed of or above its adventure-games roots. It also stakes its claim within video games, sometimes in grand overt gestures. Within the first screen of KRZ you will encounter a computer console where you can request "games." It will reply "games is not real." In Act 3, you interface with a gigantic machine which plays a version of Colossal Cave Adventure. It is, undoubtedly, pretentious. But it also puts video game influences alongside the literary and theatrical without a lot of fuss. Of course these things belong together. Why wouldn't they? That matter-of-factness grants KRZ a lot of ground to explore its own formal qualities.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it is important that we not give into astonishment. Plenty of games take inspiration from outside of video games (or even just outside of video games' regular set of influences) and they are still tiresome. BioShock Infinite is perhaps the most grandiose and spectacular example of this. There are also plenty of great games which also pull beyond the medium's clichés. Disco Elysium and Signalis made big splashes for similar reasons. Norco was unfairly compared to Kentucky Route Zero for drawing on a different set of Americana. People can be hyperbolic about KRZ, naming it as one of the most important games of all time merely for having book smarts and pro-labor politics. It's easy and tempting to exaggerate a video game's originality or power, especially when we haven't read or watched or looked at the things it is drawing from.</p><p dir="ltr">But what KRZ has, that many other games don't, is a real excitement and verve for experimentation. It is not merely that it borrows from other works of art, but that it wants to innovate on its own terms. Each of its five acts are, to some degree, daring formal exercises. From the whirring wheels and road maps of Act I to the Huckleberryian ferry ride of Act IV, the game never settles on a consistent visual language or conceit. The game took so long to make, the full game released nine years after it first appeared on a Kickstarter campaign. This is perhaps explained by how eager it is to reinvent itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Every act, released individually, does feel like something new. Main characters vanish never to appear again and the player's control and perspective alter constantly. The culmination of this is, of course, Act V, where the player plays a cat wandering a small town. The camera turns on a swivel placed in the center of town. The center of the camera is on the spoke of the wheel or the trunk of a tree, the heart on which this whole community turns. In its final moments, the game takes on a communal character, not following any individual really, but instead a place: a people.</p><p dir="ltr">If you search the right phrase, you'll find dozens of forum posts asking for movies, books, and TV shows like KRZ. The question is sort of funny on its face. What makes KRZ strange and exciting in video games is far more commonplace in essentially every other medium. It is easy, and understandable, to denigrate KRZ's contributions for this reason. Could I not just read Gabriel García Márquez, Berholt Brecht, and John Steinbeck and call it a day? But what this fosters in me is a sense of indebtedness. Self-evidently, great art steals, but that theft is not one of ownership. It's more like a torrent. Every other copy still exists; many of them have their pieces in yours. It's a network. Any theft pulls a string, tying the knot further. KRZ's final image is of a house without walls--a place that lets you in--where new friends pull up a chair for you, and lend you a book. Kentucky Route Zero is a powerful work of art, because it is an invitation. Many games are eager to bring you into their world, to make it consume you. KRZ wants nothing more than to push you into something else, to make you see the world that came before it.</p>

			<p>In an era of reboots, remasters, and endless rumours of new and old Resident Evil games, it’s refreshing to look past the noise and play an actual game whilst you wait for the latest shenanigans of the Umbrella Corporation. There’s plenty of indie counterparts these days, whether they’re looking to reinvent the genre or pay strict homage to the classics.&nbsp;The Mute House is very much in the latter category as it is very much Resident Evil by the numbers. This isn’t as damning as it may sound though, as I am always in the mood for some spooky mansion action.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mute House | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhK6vmpRJ-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most impressive thing about The Mute House is how polished the game feels considering it is the work almost entirely of a solo developer. There is some excellent use of Unreal assets (all credited) and a clear understanding of just what makes the genre work. The level design, puzzles, and combat are all first rate with only a few minor niggles leading to some frustration.</p>


<p>Alongside being a very faithful take on Resident Evil’s style and design, The Mute House is also a return to the more hardcore nature of the early games. There are no initial difficulty settings here and the intended experience is challenging in a way that reminded me of my teenage days grappling with the first Resi game on PS1.</p>
<p>You begin by playing as Amber, a young woman lost in the woods on her way back from a night out. Immediately you are thrust into a chase scene as a ‘maniac’ is following her. Amber soon finds herself taking shelter in a cabin near a mysterious mansion. The relief is short-lived, however, as this is just the beginning of her nightmare. Cut to a week later and Amber’s elder sister, Emily, a local cop is investigating her disappearance. Upon entering the mansion, the entrance is sealed behind her and her quest begins.</p>


<p>At first glance the mansion is almost a carbon copy of the original Spencer Mansion even to the point of having a concealed door behind the staircase. The rest of the levels do find their own style though, and you’ll find yourself navigating a cemetery and sinister gatehouse before you have any chance of finding Amber.</p>
<p>Navigation is familiar genre fare, with perfectly implemented tank controls and inventory management being the name of the game. One big departure from other games in the survival horror genre, though, is also perhaps the most controversial aspect here – there is no map function whatsoever. This could be a deliberate move to increase the hardcore aspect but it does take some getting used to, especially once you start unlocking shortcuts and alternative paths around the mansion. I can see the appeal of this in a second playthrough (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/dead-of-darkness-review-terror-from-the-top-down/">Dead of Darkness</a> has an achievement for not checking the map) but it did lead to some annoying backtracking at times. The ideal situation is to play through in one sitting, but the 5 or 6 hour initial playtime makes this difficult.</p>

<p>Combat plays a significant role here, with the narrow corridors in many areas not being conducive to dodging the zombies and mutated monsters that you will face. Initially you’re restricted to your police issue handgun which is fine, but soon becomes underpowered. Once you find a shotgun it will become your main go-to, although ammo management is an issue for much of the game. This area could do with some rebalancing as zombies taking 8 or 9 shots to die makes the pistol barely usable when a single shotgun shell will do the trick. I ended the game with around a dozen clips in storage and others left in the environment.</p>
<p>Inventory management is another key survival horror staple that The Mute House takes and gives a distinctive hardcore twist. Rather than the magically linked item boxes that are typical for the genre, the shelves here only act as local storage, so you need to remember where you put things and return for them. This was another aspect that took me a while to get used to, so entrenched was the usual approach, but there are a couple of centrally located shelves to work with and nowhere near the deluge of items that are in other titles. In fact, aside from some key items you’ll only need to juggle health restoration and your weapons and ammo. This, however, is also made more difficult by the odd decision not to allow item stacking. This means that each clip or box of shells is a single item and reloading with partial clips drops the bullets already in the pistol.</p>

<p>Equally central to the world of survival horror are puzzles, and The Mute House has a nice mix of key finding, item use, and some more involved environmental ones. I was especially impressed by an audio-based puzzle that required you to memorise a tune and play sections of it in the correct order, and an Indiana Jones-like floor tile puzzle that requires you to take notes from five different pictures throughout the game. The latter was less exciting the fourth and fifth time I had to repeat it though as it preceded an instant death boss encounter with no save point in between, despite there being a room in which one would have worked.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Mute House is one of the most faithful survival horror experiences currently available and is highly recommended for any fans of the genre. While clear in its influences, it also has some new ideas of its own. They don't entirely come off, but I appreciate the distinct vision at play here and once you take the game on its own terms you are set for a memorable time. I just don’t think I ever want to do that tile pattern puzzle again!	</p></div>

Of course, there's the obligatory video with glimpses from the community, but there's also lots of news about the game's future.</p>
<p>To start with, the fifth content update, titled Pact of the Flame, is available now. Its highlights include the addition of in-game text chat for multiplayer sessions as well as voice chat (when enabled, current options are proximity voice chat or a global, server-wide, plus a new Social menu), the introduction of emotes (accessible through a dedicated emote wheel), a first-person camera mode for building, new props, cosmetics, and materials with over 70 new items, two new building materials. Moreover, new quests for more vanity items are available, including a special Serpent Warrior-themed set just in time for the new Chinese Lunar Year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>A simple job they told me. Travel in luxury aboard the Herald Varonius as an agent of the rogue trader Jakel Varonius and glory will await you. I should have known things are never that easy.

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=_3mXzx0r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=aK27Opmu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM to run the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>For The Emperor!</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7s's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we're looking at here, uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused. Whereas <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (for which we will review the starter set for next month when it releases), uses a D100 system, similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces, and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this starter set is slightly different from that released in 2018 by&nbsp;Ulisses Spiele, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wrath-and-glory-starter-set-review-warhammer-40k-roleplaying" rel="nofollow">reviewed here</a>. With Cubicle 7 taking on the system, they've updated the books (this version includes a completely new adventure) and changed some of the components inside, all for the better.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=MP-uNWZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=nBRGGbyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While still of a high quality, the&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set components don't feel as polished as the other <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets Cubicle 7 offer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools Of The Faithful</h2>

<p>Like the other 2 Cubicle 7 roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Wrath and Glory</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail below, along with some quick reference sheets for the rules and a map of the system.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Traitor’s Hymn, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Wrath and Glory,</em> and&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla, a sourcebook full of details of characters the players might meet, along with ships and local politics, which can be used to either flesh out the included adventure, or create your own to expand beyond the Traitor's Hymn.</p>

<p>The maps, rules references sheets and box don't feel as polished as the other starter sets that Cubicle 7 offer. The sheets are single-sided and there's no rules reference for the GM on the inside of the box. It's not a huge deal, but compared to the others sets, it does feel like a missed opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=Ffge1wna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9BI2fdII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes an incredible spread of pre-generated characters that create fantastic party tension with their different loyalties.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Faithfull and Fallen&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The<em> Wrath and Glory</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the <em>WFRP</em> and <em>Soulbound</em> starters, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also similarly to the other starters, it has a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a Rogue Trader, who are half merchant half adventurer, a Sanctioned Psyker, a magic user approved by the Imperium, a Sister of Battle, a warrior devout to the Imperium's religious creed, a Skitarius, a heavily augmented human, a Space Marine Scout, a new recruit to the superhuman soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, and an Aeldari Ranger, a space-elf sniper.</p>

<p>The mix creates an interesting dynamic within the group, and while they may be loyal to each other, they all have higher goals or loyalties. The Rogue Trader is ultimately only out for themselves, the holier than thou Battle Sister would burn everyone she suspected of treachery, the Skitarius is only loyal to the Machine Cult, similar to the indoctrinated Space Marine who would choose their Chapter over anything, and everyone suspects the alien.</p>

<p>I said the same things in my review of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy starter set reviews, about the Games Master needing to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here it is a little simpler as the game mechanics are a lot more straight-forward (at least in the starter set, there's a lot of extra awesome depth in the full rules). This means that once the GM has a handle on the rules, they can focus on the adventure. They do have to have some ideas ready on the fly for the Wrath dice, which we discuss below, but that's an essential skill for being a good GM anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=UuN2UiJj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=4TrAepPB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set custom dice help to keep a simple system even faster to focus on the action. Watch out for the 1 on the red dice though!</figcaption></figure><h2>How To Wage War In The Name Of The Emperor</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system uses 6-sided dice (D6s), with each result of a 4+ being a success (or icon in <em>W&amp;G</em> terms). A roll of 6 counts as 2 icons, and the custom dice included in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set show this clearly, with skull icons for the 4 and 5, and a skull with a halo for the 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system keeps the game flowing fast, as the Games Master will call out a test target, 3 is standard, and the attribute and skill required for the test. For example, if you're trying to push over something heavy, it would be an Athletics - Strength skill, but if you're trying to jump over a series of obstacles, it would be an Athletics - Agility test. Once the test and difficulty is called, the player rolls a number of D6s equal to the combined attribute and skill they have and simply need to roll a number of icons equal to or above that.</p>

<p>When players collect their dice, they identify one as the Wrath die (the starter set includes a custom red die). This dice has a bonus effect of adding a complication to the roll (success or not) if a 1 is rolled, or the group gains a point of glory or it counts as a critical hit if it shows a 6. I absolutely love this little detail, which, for such a simple mechanic, really adds depth to the rolls, along with keeping players humble. Even when rolling 20 dice for a test requiring 3 icons, that little Wrath dice can still spoil your day with a complication when you succeed.</p>

<h2>Wrath and Glory Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set is a great introduction to roleplaying in the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting. The adventure has both intrigue and combat, showing the strength of the system in both areas and really allows you to get behind blasting the enemies of the Emperor. The characters are all fantastic, and if the players have a little background knowledge of the setting, can really get into the depths of the suspicions between each of them. If everyone is coming in cold to the setting, the character sheets do a great job of bringing you in, and telling you who you like and don't. The starter set mechanics are simple enough that you don't need to spend ages working out results, allowing you to focus on the combat, and are a great introduction and stepping stone to the full system.&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla book allows you to expand well beyond the introductory adventure and gives you a few sessions' worth of material for the GM to work with if you want to test the system more before investing further.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-the-majority-of-the-studio.1093692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining employees as part of what it describes as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, the studio says the layoffs were a "tough decision" and that it "recognize[s] and deeply appreciate[s] the contributions of every individual impacted". The studio stops short of saying exactly how many employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what this might mean for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, for cozy sim&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>), Phoenix Labs says it'll share more on its plans for these games "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=VqegnAn- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=P2RJgd2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining staff.</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the rather vague "unfortunate but necessary changes", Phoenix Labs doesn't offer any kind of reason as to why this decision has been made.</p>

<p>However, the studio has come in for criticism recently regarding the most recent major&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>update, otherwise known as Awakening.</p>

<p>The update has proven unpopular with players, resulting in the game hitting an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a>, where it was released on the same day as the Awakening update landed.</p>

<p>Criticism included the update's changes to monetization, progression, and other gameplay systems, with some laying the blame at the feet of Phoenix Labs' owner Forte Labs, a blockchain-focused company that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">purchased</a> the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-acquired-by-garena" rel="nofollow">former owner Garena</a> (from which Forte itself spun off) in 2023.</p>




<p>The changes to <em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>proved unpopular enough to prompt Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">issue an apology</a> and promise to make "immediate adjustments" back in December, but if the game's current Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count</a> (at time of writing) is anything to go by, those changes haven't made much of a difference.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if Phoenix Labs' layoffs are directly related to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' recent performance, the studio is far from alone in laying off employees; these layoffs are taking place against the backdrop of a much wider wave of staff cuts, project cancellations, and studio closures.</p>

<p>Other studios hit in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">Reflector Entertainment</a>, tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, among many others.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-call-of-dyuty-collab/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sledgehammer-games-planned-to-have-halo-maps-in-modern-warfare-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1093686/</guid>

<p>Sledgehammer Games once had plans to have a massive Halo collaboration in Modern Warfare 3, where some Halo maps would come to Call of Duty.</p>



<p>That’s according to leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1884053078682566742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@TheGhostOfHope</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly returned back to form and started to leak details in regards to Call of Duty again after taking a break.</p>



<p>In a new post, Hope revealed that “Sledgehammer Games had plans to do a huge collaboration with Halo with Modern Warfare III which would have added various maps from the Halo franchise.”</p>



<p>Another leaker and dataminer by the name of Alaix seemingly confirmed the details by saying, “maybe one day i’ll feel generous enough to share some of the screenshots I have from this collab.”</p>



<p>While it’s currently not known on what maps, weapons, or outfits would have made it into Modern Warfare 3, it’s intriguing to know that there where at least plans at one stage, with Alaix’s comments implying that there was even assets made.</p>



<p>It means that Microsoft could visit such collaborations again in the future, depending on how the Call of Duty franchise performs and how much interest such collaborations would bring in.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Microsoft have been considered Call of Duty and other Microsoft IP crossovers. In November 2024, it was claimed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-doom-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War</a>. While those leaks are yet to come to fruition, where there’s some, there’s fire.</p>



<p>Would you like to see a massive Halo x Call of Duty crossover in a future CoD title? What do you think of Halo once being planned to be in Modern Warfare 3?

Keen Games consistently delivered updates for it throughout 2024, and the same will happen in 2025. Enshrouded's 2025 roadmap kicks off today, January 28, with the Pact of the Flame update. Pact of the Flame adds several useful multiplayer features to Enshrouded, including an in-game text chat, options for proximity or server-wide voice chat, emotes, and a new social menu. On top of that, a first-person camera mode for building and over 80 new items have been added.</p><p>Keen Games also released a roadmap of Enshrouded's expected 2025 updates. Throughout this year, new features like an event system, base raids, weather events, the ability to teleport between servers, build sharing, and a new biome are all expected to come to Enshrouded. Following even more updates early next year, we can all expect Enshrouded's development to crescendo with a 1.0 launch next spring.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Robot Entertainment has revealed the post-launch&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it includes a new War Mage, a new enemy type, and much more.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement" rel="nofollow">announced last year</a>, launched for PC and Xbox Series X|S today, but Robot Entertainment isn't resting on its laurels. The developer took to Steam earlier today to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2273980/view/533214336538116486" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">share its vision</a> for where&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will go in the future.</p>

<p>In the post, Robot Entertainment organizes forthcoming updates into two categories: In the Works and Coming "Soon", and "The Road Ahead". It's probably not too difficult to guess what each category represents.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=Mhu4OMCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=DGfyTDK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>has barely been out a few hours, but its developer has already shared the game's post-launch plans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the former category, Robot Entertainment promises a new War Mage in the form of Master Gabriella, who's appeared in previous&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>games as well. She'll have "an exciting kit of tricks" and will reintroduce Arcane magic into the game.</p>

<p>Next up, the Resort Canal map will ask you to defend two rifts simultaneously, and it'll take place in the game's Coastal biome. You can also look forward to a new Unstable Orc enemy, which takes a great deal of punishment before it dies to compensate for its slow movement.</p>

<p>Rounding out the Coming Soon category are an Alchemy lab, which will offer you buffs for each run, and a new Gnome Balloonist Sentinel, which will "add more ceiling space for traps".</p>

<p>As for the road ahead, Robot Entertainment says it plans to support&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>"for as long as possible", and that the studio has "ideas for a wide variety of content and features".</p>




<p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series, combining the franchise's traditional action-tower defense hybrid gameplay with a new roguelite-inspired approach and "deeper progression systems".</p>

<p>You can grab the game right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/orcs-must-die-deathtrap/9p0302f6v9vt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

The report follows <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1883938087446995432">teases made by the official Sims account on X</a> as part of a 25th anniversary celebrations roadmap, as well as a few other scattered hints in various bits of promo as collated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i1frue/the_sims_1_2_and_3_might_be_rereleasing_for_the/">Redditor skyline7284</a>. "According to a source familiar with the plans, both games will be released digitally on PC later this week," write Kotaku.</p>

<p>The first two Sims games released in 2000 and 2004 respectively, but neither domestic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation game</a> has been easy to play on PC for years. Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) had to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/returning-to-the-sims-1-in-2023-is-a-weird-challenge-i-fully-recommend">install The Sims on a Windows Vista machine</a> from 2008 to revisit it in 2023, and the Sims 2 has long been offline, with the last digital copies removed from sale in 2014 around the time that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> released.</p>
<p>The next Sims thing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">Project Rene</a>, is still in development, although EA have said that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">won't be Sims 5</a>, technically. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">they blogged last</a> September. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."</p>
<p>Paradox cancelled their own Sims competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> last year, and laid off staff following what one developer called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-devs-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-prior-to-closure-says-laid-off-designer-despite-their-sim-like-exceeding-paradoxs-expectations">"a month in purgatory"</a>. They've since said they'd like to take another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">crack at a similar game</a>.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-announced-nba-2k-style-island-hub-intergender-march-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new year means another entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry’s flagship wrestling franchise</a>, and today 2K Games unveiled WWE 2K25. After a few years of relatively conservative updates, it seems like developer Visual Concepts is going all out with WWE 2K25, which adds a new island hub you can explore with up to 50 other players, a Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase mode, and a roster of over 300 Superstars, with no restrictions on who can fight who – yes, intergender wrestling is in. You can check out the first teaser trailer for WWE 2K25, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OTC is ready for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWE2K25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWE2K25</a>! ☝️☝️☝️ <a href="https://t.co/tx4p6Fj9Ks">pic.twitter.com/tx4p6Fj9Ks</a></p>
<p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href="https://twitter.com/WWE/status/1884080756705685505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And here’s a look at the game’s covers and some early screenshots…</p>

</figure>


<p>WWE 2K25 most standout new feature will likely be The Island, an online hub similar to ones seen in NBA 2K for years, in which you can interact with other players and complete various challenges. Interestingly, The Island will feature its own storyline, in which you vie to impress Roman Reigns that's completely separate from the usual MyRise story mode (which is still in the game). The Island will be exclusive for the current-gen Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game (it seems PC players will have to sit the feature out).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Bloodline Rules Showcase will open things up somewhat, offering three different types of matches – ones that let you relive history, ones that let you change history, and dream matches that never got to occur in real life. Want to know how a historic Bloodline member like Yokozuna might match up against the current roster? Now you can.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K25…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Match Types and Gameplay Improvements:</strong> Intergender wrestling makes its long- awaited debut in the WWE 2K franchise! WWE or player-created Superstars from the men’s and women’s divisions can now compete against each other to set up limitless matchups across all game modes. Additional features include the return of Chain Wrestling, Bloodline Rules Match, Underground Match, and new barricade diving! More details on each new match type will be shared soon.</li>
<li><strong>MyGM Online Multiplayer:</strong> Intrepid GMs can take their show on the road and challenge general managers worldwide in the enhanced MyGM for WWE 2K25, now with online multiplayer for up to four players. Players draft WWE Superstars and Legends to their weekly show’s roster and lead their brand through multiple-week seasons with a bigger selection of General Managers, cross- brand Premium Live Events, and more.</li>
<li><strong>MyRise:</strong> Players guide their Superstar from the women’s or men’s division in a singular, multi-gender MyRise storyline where Bayley, Kevin Owens, and other Superstars infiltrate NXT in an attempt to take control of the entire WWE. Featuring new personality choices that lead to specific storylines, as well as brawl environments, unlockable arenas, characters, useable objects, and more, plus new ally storylines involving Jey Uso, Bianca Belair, Seth Rollins, and other Superstars.</li>
<li><strong>Universe:</strong> WWE 2Ks sandbox mode receives upgrades to give players greater control over their Universe experience, including the long-awaited return of Promos! The new system includes multiple promo types and outcomes with new cutscenes and branching choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like WWE 2K25 is looking to mix up the formula a bit -- following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious but steady improvement</a> over the past few years, we'll see if the gambit pays off. As usual, WWE 2K25 will come in an array of different editions, including the basic standard edition for $70 on both current and last-gen consoles, the $100 Deadman Edition, and the $130 Bloodline Edition. Everyone who pre-orders any edition gets the Wyatt Sicks Pack, which includes characters Uncle Howdy, Dexter Lumis, Nikki Cross, Joe Gacy, and Erick Rowan. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the Deadman and Bloodline Editions of the game…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadman Edition</strong> – “Deadman Edition Bonus Pack” which includes Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Undertaker and Original Undertaker (‘90) Persona Cards and playable Superstars, a useable Urn object, Undertaker ‘95 Mask cosmetic item for The Island, and Brother Love Manager, plus a Season Pass to all five post-launch DLC character packs and 15,000 VC.</li>
<li><strong>The Bloodline Edition</strong> - All bonus content included in the Deadman Edition, the Ringside Pass (Season Pass plus Superstar Mega-Boost), The Rock Nation of Domination Pack, which features a Rock Nation of Domination Persona card and playable Superstar, plus The Bloodline Edition Bonus Pack, which features Mattel Elite Series 114 Jey Uso and Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Roman Reigns Persona cards and playable Superstars. Also Family Above All Hoodie, OTC Shirt, Yeet tank Top and Yeet Sunglasses cosmetic items for The Island, while for Steam only, it includes an additional 32,500 VC. Also included is the WrestleMania 41 Pack which features the WrestleMania 41 Arena, two WrestleMania 41 Main Event Superstars Persona cards and playable Superstars, and a new Superstar Persona Card (TBA), which will all be available Summer 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWE 2K25 hits PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who drop the cash for the Deadman or Bloodline Editions can play a week early on March 7. Look forward to a Wccftech preview and review of WWE 2K25 over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Dead Drop’s Workbenches in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 represents a big step up. The hand-holding is gone, and you need to go on a serious expedition to find all the Collectibles if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission 1’s Workbench Collectible</a> is child’s play compared to the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. Dead Drop is the first big, open map to explore. It has 19 Collectibles to find—including three Workbenches. Finding these is imperative to give Harry the best chance of surviving the never-ending onslaught of German troops.</p>



<p>I’ve provided a simple and easy-to-use map showing you the locations of every Workbench, but if you need a few extra details with more specifics, we have that too.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-2-dead-drop">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 Dead Drop</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Force your path. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The little Cog symbol represents a Workbench</strong>—and I’ve circled them for you anyway. Each one is equidistant from the other and they’re spread fairly well around the map. There’s no necessary route to take to find all of <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance’s Mission 2 Workbench locations, but I’ll provide my experience and how I found them.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-1-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 1 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s just behind this door. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start Dead Drop and head to the broken stone bridge. Go left, and climb up the vines to get into a broken tower. Climb the tower, kill the guard, and head through the castle doorway. Pick up the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Propaganda Poster</a> on the stairs to your left if you haven’t already, carry on up, and go into the house. </p>



<p>Charge down both sets of stairs and exit the house left. Head West through the streets—doing your best to avoid becoming a human bullet sponge. <strong>Using the screenshot “Every Workbench Location” screenshot earlier</strong>, you can see the Workbench is found in a big building in the very Southwest quadrant of the level. Reach the building, and the Workbench is up the stairs and behind a locked door—after you pass through a mini-courtyard area.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-2-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 2 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go up to the courtyard and look left. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s time to head North from this building. Head left past the “<strong>Find Vertigo’s Dead Drop at the Balisca” Main Objective</strong> building. Pass through the gardens and keep running in a straight line—<strong>watch out for the Sniper ahead up high</strong> who can easily spot you. You should eventually reach a small flight of stairs to go down, situated next to a barbed-wire fence and locked door. </p>



<p>Go between the houses and run around to the entrance of <strong>the “Locate Vertigo’s Office” building</strong>. Head up to the main gate and into the courtyard. Immediately on your left is a locked door. Either open it manually or use Bolt Cutters. Inside is the second Workbench.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-3-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 3 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go through to the other side, and down the stairs. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the easiest way to reach Workbench three is to follow the natural road around the top of the map, sticking to the outside parts of the map and using walls for cover. <strong>Go past the “Find Stolen Resistance Files”</strong> area, and opposite it is a building with open doors.</p>



<p>Go through this doorway and the other open doors round the back. Turn right, and go down the stairs. Go right again, and you should see a locked door. Once more, either pick the lock, or use Bolt Cutters, go inside, and the Workbench is right there!</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope this guide was useful and you have all three Workbenches ticked off and added to your collection. I’ve put together other handy guides to help your Sniper Elite Resistance experience too: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All mission names</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is</a>.</p>

But, which Xbox game series get you most excited? Which gave you more enjoyment than any other in the glory days of the 360? Or if you’ve never owned an Xbox console, which are you most looking forward to coming to other platforms like PlayStation, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-starfield-coming-out-on-ps5-phil-spencer-wont-rule-it-out">Microsoft seemingly continues its plans to share its library with the world</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are many legendary game series to choose from (especially since Microsoft’s acquisitions of both Bethesda and Activision Blizzard.

Give us a sequel, please, and then you can make the cut. Just a reminder that this isn’t an <em>all </em>Xbox Game Series list, so we haven’t involved every single Xbox game series here, but have tried to cover the bases of current relevance and historical impact.

I’ve also placed Forza Horizon in the S tier as they’re, perhaps outside of Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge, the best racing games I’ve ever played. I’m sure Halo in the A tier may raise a few eyebrows, but while 2 and 3 are two of the finest campaign shooters ever made, I can’t ignore more recent inconsistencies and put it in that top bracket. I’m also more of a Fallout person than an Elder Scrolls one. I’d rather own a set of power armour than a dragon, OK?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think Gears of War is Xbox’s best?

            <p>Roman Reigns will be the cover star for WWE 2K25, the next in the long-running wrestling series, alongside its largest-ever roster.</p>
<p>It will also include a new The Island mode to complete challenges in a bid to impress "The Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>The new game is set for release in March (7th or 14th, depending on edition) across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam, though The Island will only be available in the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p>

<p>The Island will be a world consisting of areas based on different WWE themes where players can complete quests, take on challenges, compete in live events, and upgrade MySuperstars characters through storyline chapters.</p>
<p>The game's roster, meanwhile, will include 300 wrestlers, including Superstars, Legends, and Hall of Famers - from John Cena and The Rock, to "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Trish Stratus and more.</p>
<p>Other additions include a third-person camera for online matches (controlled separately by each player); the 2K Showcase: The Bloodline's Dynasty mode celebrating the iconic wrestling family dynasty; intergender wrestling makes its debut across all game modes; and the return of Promos in the Universe mode.</p>
<p>The creation suite will also be updated as per each new game, which is considered one of the most detailed and robust <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators</a>.</p>
<p>"I am personally and professionally excited that the Original and Only Tribal Chief and the extended Anoa'i family are the focus of WWE 2K25," said Roman Reigns. "We've been building toward this moment for generations and I challenge players everywhere to show me and my Wiseman, Paul Heyman, what they've got, and prove they're worthy of the attention of their Tribal Chief."</p><p>"WWE 2K25 expands on our winning formula in nearly every aspect of the player experience," said Greg Thomas, president of developer Visual Concepts. "Our new approach to 2K Showcase and MyRISE storylines really tap into the creativity of the development team, and we're excited to see our community enjoy these updated features."</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 is available now to pre-order across three editions: Standard Edition ($69.99), Deadman Edition ($99.99), and The Bloodline Edition ($129.99), with the latter two including new cosmetics and the Season Pass to post-launch DLC character packs, as well as seven day earlier access - that's 7th March ahead of the Standard Edition on 14th March.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark">WWE 2K23 had its online servers shut down</a>, leaving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game currently available with online functionality. It will soon be joined by 2K25 in March in a clear push towards the latest game in the series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Xbox owner Microsoft is currently in discussions to buy social media giant TikTok.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the newly-reinstalled US President Trump, who has now told reporters of Microsoft's involvement (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Reuters</a>). Microsoft itself has declined to comment.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's current status in the US appears precarious, after it was banned by the previous US administration and the US Supreme Court due to national security concerns linked to the app's Chinese owner ByteDance. Here in Europe, the UK government, BBC and the European Commission have banned the app from use on official phones.

<p>
Ahead of returning to office, Trump had signalled he would pause the ban - though TikTok still took itself offline within the US for a brief window, before returning online with a message that thanked Trump personally.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's US ban is now officially paused for 75 days, during which time the social media giant and its compulsive algorithm must either be sold or banned for good. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft is one of a few companies with deep enough pockets to make a serious bid, with various valuations of TikTok ranging around $100bn, and some even higher.
</p>
<p>
Still, as we well know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft seemed happy to shell out $67.8bn just a couple of years ago to snap up Call of Duty and World of Warcraft maker Activision Blizzard</a>. What's $30bn more for control of the hugely-influential TikTok?
</p><p>
Microsoft has been interested in TikTok previously, and got close to a bid in 2020 during Trump's first term in office. Other contenders to buy the social media firm include cloud technology company Oracle, as well as X owner Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>
TikTok would be, by far, Microsoft's biggest acquisition to date. Other than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Microsoft previously paid $26bn for LinkedIn, $19.7bn for speech recognition company Nuance Communications, $8.5bn for Skype, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-usd7-5bn-deal-to-acquire-zenimax-approved-in-the-us-and-eu">$7.5bn for Bethesda owner ZeniMax Media</a>.
</p>
<p>Last week, popular card battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-team-seeking-new-publisher-as-game-returns-online-following-unexpected-us-ban-alongside-tiktok">Marvel Snap returned online with an apology to players</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">it was also made briefly unavailable</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is published by Nuverse, another company owned by TikTok parent ByteDance. Marvel Snap's development team has now said it will seek an alternative publishing partner.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-30-hours-long/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-will-be-around-20-30-hours-long-and-feature-four-difficulty-levels.1093593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-30-hours-long/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero is looking to be much longer than the typical hack and slash games, judging from information revealed during some recent interviews.</p>
<p>As revealed on <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/9446196938?share=9105&amp;fr=sharewise&amp;see_lz=0&amp;share_from=post&amp;sfc=copy&amp;client_type=2&amp;client_version=12.60.1.2&amp;st=1737962073&amp;is_video=false&amp;unique=D7A94B34CF77EF0E45F70BE4B6253665#/">Chinese forums Tieba</a>, it has been revealed in a recent interview that the game in development by S-Game will require between 20 and 30 hours to complete the main story, with 20 hours of additional side content, which should make the game feel more in line with modern action role-playing games that pure action games that are typically much shorter. The game will also feature a total of four difficulty levels ranging from simple to extremely difficult, so the total play time will likely be higher for those who wish to be challenged or want to play through the game multiple times at different difficulty levels. No matter the difficulty, however, players will not have to completely restart boss battles upon defeat, as they will start again at the second phase if they reach it before being defeated.</p>
<p>Speaking about bosses, these recent interviews have also confirmed how Phantom Blade Zero will feature what sounds like a boss-rush mode where it will be possible to fight main campaign bosses again. This mode will also feature some hidden bosses, so it definitely sounds like the game will feature plenty of content. 30 main weapons and more than 20 secondary weapons will be available in the game, so combat should be pretty varied.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat mechanics, I feel S-Game already has them down well, as I really enjoyed the small slice of Phantom Blade Zero I played during<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/"> Gamescom 2024.</a> If traversal, level design, and encounter design are as good as the combat mechanics, the game has the potential to become one of the best action games ever released.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. You can check out the game's latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/">here</a>.</p>

You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words.

<p>Larian Studios recently informed players that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 stress test began on PS5 earlier than intended by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Larian Studio released a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> confirming that some PS5 users accidentally received early access to Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 before the stress test’s intended date. If you see version 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053 on your main menu, you are also one of the users who received the automatic update. Moreover, the unintentional update on your PS5 doesn’t guarantee access to Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 Stress Test when it officially arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883957300123349467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that some regions in Europe and Asia mistakenly received the new patch early “as an update to their live game version in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test.” Players should know that this version of Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 is unsupported, and the developers have suggested revert to patch 7. Players will face compatibility issues with save games, mods, and multiplayer if they continue to play Patch 8. If you have already updated Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, here’s how to return to Patch 7.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-return-to-baldur-s-gate-patch-7-after-unintentional-ps5-update">How to Return to Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 After Unintentional PS5 Update</h2>



<p>To know if your PS5 has received the unintentional Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 updates, head to the Main Menu and read your version number. If it is 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053, you have fallen victim to the unintentional update. However, there is a straightforward way to get rid of the issue. Just uninstall the Baldur’s Gate 3 application from your console and then reinstall it to be reverted to patch 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Steve Ogg, the actor behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s breakout main character Trevor, has said he wants to return in Rockstar's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> in order to die at the very beginning. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg said he believed the idea would make for a neat moment where he passed the torch to GTA 6's new protagonists - even if it meant getting his head kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"It would be fun if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning. I think that would be cool," Ogg said.

<p>
"Because it also acknowledges the fans... like 'Hey, thank you. Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over'."
</p>
<p>
The moment would mirror an early moment with Trevor in GTA 5, where the character quickly offs GTA 4 character Johnny Kleibitz.
</p>
<p>
Alas, with less than a year until the game's debut, Ogg has said he's not yet been asked to return.
</p>
<p>
In the 12 years since GTA 5's release, Ogg's career has taken off, with roles in The Walking Dead, Westworld and Better Call Saul. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar, meanwhile, has spent the last decade expanding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> with new content, and building the hotly-anticipated GTA 6 - which is currently due to launch (sans Trevor) later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Last week, speculation swirled that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">Rockstar might choose to make GTA 6 cost £80, or $100</a>, ushering in a new industry-wide raise in game prices. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">GTA 6 "parody" game looks set to launch soon on Steam, despite being kicked off the PlayStation Store</a>.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and Fae Farms developer Phoenix Labs has announced that they are laying off “the majority of the studio”, leaving the future of their two games seriously in doubt.</p>
<p>On a post to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn</a>, the studio writes:</p>


<p>Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.</p>
<p>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</p>

<p>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals – they are some of the best in the business.</p>
<p>The company had previously made significant cuts last year, with layoffs and project cancellations in May 2024 that were estimated to affect around 140 employees.</p>
<p>Our thoughts naturally go out to all of those now affected by these further layoffs, and we hope that, as dire as the games industry is looking right now, they’re able to find fresh work soon.</p>
<p>This latest announcement would suggest that ongoing development for Dauntless and Fae Farm will be seriously affected, and it remains to be seen if and how the company plans to support them going forward.</p>
<p>Dauntless was the studio’s biggest hit getting its full launch in 2019 and able to ride the wave of interest in the Monster Hunter formula. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/25/dauntless-review-2020-switch-ps4-xbox-mobile/">Dauntless review</a>, we said, “Although hardly original in its premise, Dauntless offers an extremely fun and accessible take on the monster-hunting roleplaying game. It wastes no time in throwing you straight into the action and while easy to pick up there’s plenty of depth there for fans of the genre. What’s more Dauntless is completely free to play, gracefully sidestepping those annoying monetisation pitfalls we’re so used to seeing.”</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s Behind Enemy Lines is Mission 1 and has the first Workbench in the game. The level lacks the depth and complexity of later maps, but it serves as an adequate introductory mission, and you can still miss the first Workbench if you’re not thorough.</p>



<p>Behind Enemy Lines ticks all the right boxes to start a Campaign: Introduces us to Harry Hawker, has tutorials showing us the ropes of the gameplay, and its fairly linear structure prepares us for the more open levels. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 1 features the Workbench Collectible.</p>



<p>So let’s get the first mission done as easily as possible and get you on the board.</p>

<p><strong>The Behind Enemy Lines Workbench is hidden behind a boarded-up door in Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 1.</strong></p>



<p>Using the two screenshots I’ve provided above, you can see how to get to the Workbench. Thankfully, unlike later levels, there’s <strong>only one to find</strong> this time around. However, due to <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>‘s gameplay and openness, you can easily finish the level and miss it.</p>



<p>From the start of the level, you can only follow one linear path to reach the Workbench area. It requires you to go under the bridge, shoot the Dam, and climb up. Once you get to the top, <strong>the Workbench is in the house in front of you</strong>.</p>



<p>Inside, on the left, you find a boarded-up door. There are three ways to deal with boarded-up doorways in Sniper Elite Resistance: </p>



<ul>
<li>Use a found Crowbar.</li>



<li>Dismantle them using your hands.</li>



<li>Shoot the boards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each solution depends on the situation. Here, a Crowbar is found next to the door, making this the easiest and quietest solution. </p>



<p>Pull the boards off the door, head inside, and the Workbench is here. Walk up to it and interact with it to register the Collectible, putting the Collectible’s location on the map for any subsequent playthroughs of the mission. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-workbenches-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Workbenches Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>Workbenches are used to acquire new weapons and part upgrades and have been featured in Sniper Elite before.</strong></p>



<p>To unlock new Suppressors, recoil-reducing parts, and much more, you need to find Workbenches and use them. It makes the game easier for you and makes the daunting task of completing missions on Authentic Difficulty more palatable—making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s Trophies and Achievements list</a> easier as well.</p>
