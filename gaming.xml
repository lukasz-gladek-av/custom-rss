		<p>AI has taken over the world of Ra Ra Boom. This is an apocalyptic Earth, but not in the traditional Skynet style of decimation we’re used to. Instead, we meet our four heroes as they are sitting in a mundane, interminably boring classroom, safe in a sanctuary that looks like your everyday American high school. They’ve been selected, hand-picked even, thanks to their special traits, to train, practice and prepare for the return of the despotic AI and its minions, This quite conveniently happens just in time for the start of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Get Skippy Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysFzhw2cEJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.</p>


<p>And you get to smash plenty of robots. Ra Ra Boom brings the traditional batch of light and heavy attacks, as well as an Ultimate that you charge by successfully landing blows on those badniks. On top of that, each character has a ranged attack, guns and missiles destroying everything in their path, and giving you a great way to continue attacking while you close the distance to smash them up some more. Punches and kicks feel suitably swift, though I’d like to feel a little more weight to each blow.</p>


<p>The enemy are aggressive. These robots are hell-bent on putting you down, and even when you’ve taken many of the metal monsters out, they’ll resurrect, rushing at you with flailing limbs in a last attempt to deal you damage. It means you have to be ever watchful, and I’d definitely like to see some kind of finisher move to stop them from getting back up again. This is quality fisticuffs action though, and I really enjoyed the old-school thrills of walking left to right, hitting everything in my path.</p>
<p>It helps that Ra Ra Boom looks great. There’s a real America’s Best Comics vibe to the visuals, and each of the main characters is unique and vibrantly designed. I love some of the robot designs seen in the demo – particularly the massive single-eyed robotic boss character – and I can hope that the full game will showcase even more interesting designs and epic encounters.</p>

<p>My only current worry is that Ra Ra Boom is pretty tough, and some of that doesn’t always feel fair. Enemies can nab you a little too easily at times when you’re not expecting it, and there’s a running section where it’s nigh-on impossible to avoid the high-speed full-lane attacks that come your way, even though the path of the attack is laid out on the ground.</p>
<p>Ra Ra Boom has bags of potential, and as a fan of co-op action and classic beat ‘em ups, it’s definitely grabbed my attention. We won’t have to wait too long to see the whole game in action, as It’s set to launch for PC, PS5, XSX|S and Linux this August.</p>

		<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been announced been confirmed for PS5, and that it will be coming later this year. If the Xbox Series XS had a year’s exclusivity, then that release will be on or after November 20th. The PS5 version of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will use the DualSense features like haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. GSC Game World has also said that it will be developing PS5 Pro enhancements for the game, but has not detailed what these will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Official PS5 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since its launch, STALKER 2 has received quite substantial updates bringing a couple of thousand fixes to the game. Recently, update 1.5 was released with this adding the Three-Line Rifle and Kora Pistol. In addition, the update brought in mutant parts trading allowing you sell parts from monsters, which can be a lucrative trade to be in. The world has also been made more immersive with all characters in the zone having their own simulated lives, even when they are not in the player’s view.</p>

<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Miguel said, <em>“STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</em></p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is making the jump to PS5 sometime in late 2025, developer GSC Game World has announced. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the official STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl X account, and with a short teaser trailer published through IGN, featuring characters in the game playing STALKER 2 on what looks like a STALKER-looking version of a PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>"<em>The Perimeter expands - STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is officially announced for PlayStation 5</em>," the <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1942932316466065731">studio wrote in its post</a>. It's currently available to wish list on the PlayStation Store for those who want to ensure they get a notification when pre-orders go live and the release date is announced. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Official PS5 Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>STALKER 2 launched towards the end of 2024 on PC and as a console-exclusive for Xbox Series X/S devices, though the fact that every other STALKER game is available on PlayStation was at least a tip that those with nothing but a PS5 at home just had to be patient if they wanted to dive into the latest entry in the long-running series. </p>



<p>When it first launched, it arrived in a touch of controversy, with a number of outlets reviewing a version of the game that was decidedly broken prior to launch, only for a significant portion of those issues to be fixed with a patch that arrived just in time for launch. It still wasn't perfect, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo noted in his review</a>, but even with all the bugs, he still marked it as "<em>a worthy successor of the original in every regard."</em> Even with all its issues, earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/">STALKER 2 surpassed 6 million players worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>GSC Game World has continued to patch the game and release fixes, the most recent of which arrived just <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/">last month with a significant patch that added modding tools for PC players.</a> By the time it makes it onto PS5, there's a solid chance that PS5 and PS5 Pro players will get the best console experience from day-one, simply because they'll get to play a version that, hopefully, isn't as riddled with bugs as the game was when it launched on Xbox Series X/S. </p>

The devs confirmed the sci-fi shooter “will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion,” on Sony’s platform. A PS5 Pro update is also in the works, though it’s unclear if that will be ready in time for the PS5 launch. </p><p>  <em>Stalker 2</em> earned fresh fans and won over older ones with its dedication to plunking players down in a mysterious and hostile environment where every bullet and health pack is precious and the mere act of seeing what’s down a road requires a minor act of in-game courage. It does not pander or hand-hold, and with more time spent and less jank (and an earlier release date) it might have entered more GOTY-contender conversations. </p><p>Unfortunately, the bugs at launch on PC and Xbox Series X/S were hard to completely ignore, even if they were entirely par for the course with a complex sandbox game and in keeping with <em>Stalke</em>r’s messy history. While there have been a healthy number of updates and patches in the months since its release, some players have lost patience, and<em> Stalker 2</em>'s ratings on both Steam and Xbox have only gotten spottier. “I’ve been defending <em>Stalker 2</em> since release, but I feel like I am starting to give up a bit,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wrote one fan</a></span> on the subreddit last month in a thread explaining their frustrations.</p><p>I imagine porting the game to another set of hardware will only complicate things further.

"Players peaked in the week of May 25 and then started to fall back a bit. There was another bump in mid- to late- June as the game was put into various sales and things as well but that's a story for two weeks from now."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, meanwhile, debuted at the top of the charts for May, and became the 11th best-selling game of 2025 so far, topping the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC storefronts. When we asked Piscatella for comment, he noted that Elden Ring: Nightreign and the original Elden Ring weren't really comparable sales-wise, due to being very different games sold at very different prices. "That being said, Nightreign launch unit sales did not reach the same neighborhood as those of Elden Ring."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was followed closely by debut game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> at No. 2, which is also now the 16th best-selling game of 2025. As with Nightreign, The Dark Ages didn't hit the sales heights of its predecessor, Doom: Eternal, but according to Piscatella, "this is more timing than anything. Doom Eternal launched in March 2020... and nothing is going to ever comp well to any new game that launched in March of 2020."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New games F1 25 and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 debuted at No. 15 and No. 19, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, spending on video game content was up 2% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, largely driven by subscription spending on non-mobile platforms, according to analysis by Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending dropped by 13% year-over-year in May, to $172 million, with Nintendo Switch dollar sales dropping 44%, Xbox Series dropping 30%, and PlayStation growing 3%. The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in both unit sales and dollars. Next month's charts for June will show the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2's release on this landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, video game spending was up 1% year-over-year to $4.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">May 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign (NEW)</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages (NEW)</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>F1 25 (NEW)</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>The Last of Us: Part II</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Capcom Fighting Collection 2 (NEW)</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Continuing development is not sustainable..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The live service bloodbath continues — this time the casualty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, the mech shooter game from the people behind World of Tanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Hunters launched on April 2 in early access form on Steam. Some had hoped for Titanfall vibes from this free-to-play, PvPvE shooter, but it fell completely flat. And just three months later, developer Wargaming has announced plans to sunset the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post addressing Steel Hunter’s community, Wargaming said the game’s servers will live on for another three months before the game goes dark permanently from October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters,” Wargaming’s statement began. “You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Amid the difficulties so many live service games have endured in recent times,  Steel Hunters failed to capture an audience. It launched on Steam with a peak of 4,479 concurrent players and a ‘mixed’ user review rating, and it was downhill from there. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was 97, with just 52 concurrent players — that’s devastating for any free-to-play game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakura/recommended/1691340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top user review on Steam</a>, from a player with over 300 hours on Steel Hunters including its various pre-launch forms, lamented the potential of the game, and praised its mech design and maps. However, they critisized Wargaming's lack of a roadmap, slow pace of updates, and various bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Early access should have never happened," they said. "We should have never left beta. Time and time again the players have been vocal about changes or fixes that were needed and have come to the table with very helpful solutions only to be met with 'we are moving forward' only to then react with 'why did it go south?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service video games are enduring a tough time right now, with a number of titles falling by the wayside or finding themselves canceled before launch. Sony’s Concord is perhaps the highest-profile example of that, a PlayStation disaster that cost the gaming business hundreds of millions of dollars. But only last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">Microsoft canceled an unannounced MMORPG from the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, resulting in hundreds of layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157221/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Back in the mid-to-late '90s, Tamagotchi virtual pets were a <em>massive</em> fad, with kids around the world eagerly raising and interacting with cutesy animals on their tiny pea-green screens. Though the fad inevitably died out, Tamagotchi continued to exist in various forms across the next couple of decades, including a handful of video games developed mostly for portable consoles.</p>
<p>Of these, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tamagotchi_connection_corner_shop">Corner Shop</a> games on the DS and 3DS proved especially popular, and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> acts as a sort of spiritual successor to them. Though it’s interesting and vaguely entertaining at first, Tamagotchi Plaza unfortunately reveals all too quickly that its limp collection of drab minigames has little value to offer the player.</p>
<p>Tamagotchi Plaza breaks the fourth wall and begins its plot with the player being abducted by Prince Tamahiko in his UFO and spirited away from Earth to Tamagotchi Planet. Despite a brief apology, you’re then thrust into the role of the chair for the Tamahiko Town development committee, which has been given the task of improving various aspects of the town to strengthen its bid to host the coveted Tamagotchi Fest. After appointing a vice-chair (who acts as your avatar), you then send them across town to work in the various shops and begin building everything up.</p>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157222/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as plot goes, this is about as paper-thin as it gets, but the narrative here does a great job of setting an effective, cosy atmosphere through the interactions with the various residents. Everyone is so kind and supportive, you're almost inclined to forget that you were abducted and forced into labouring for this strange consumerist society.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Tamagotchi Plaza centres around a collection of minigame shops where you conduct various services, such as dentistry or pool service, for the residents and collect money while being rated on your performance. Over time (and after enough highly-rated performances), you can invest the money earned into the plaza itself to improve its visual aesthetics or into the shops to expand their selection of activities. On paper, it sounds like a good enough deal, granting a diverse selection of minigames to play at your own pace and slowly develop mastery in.</p>
<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157233/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with all of this is… well, the minigames just aren’t that <em>good</em>. As opposed to something like the forgotten gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a>, which offered a series of brief but rich experiences, Tamagotchi Plaza's are largely dull and shallow affairs. For example, manning a shift at the ‘night pool’ involves you mixing drinks and giving towels to various pool patrons. When a request comes through, you simply select the correct drink ingredients from a small menu and give it to them.</p>
<p>Most minigames are similar in how they quickly show themselves to be mindless busywork—there’s no real sense of urgency or skill involved in doing whatever basic task. And though shop upgrades will help to make each respective minigame a <em>little</em> more complicated, you’re still ultimately grinding through mindless activities and being rewarded regardless of how poorly you perform. Even the Switch 2 exclusive shops, which utilise its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-mouse-mode-compatible-games">Mouse Mode</a>, fail to do much to make the pointer gimmick fun or interesting.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, the minigames are also sometimes just obtuse enough that it takes trial and error to even understand what you’re supposed to do. One shop tasks you with serving guests afternoon tea, but the menu of items to put together their order gives no indication or description of what makes its various items distinct, leading to frustrating sequences where you pick something that <em>looks ‘</em>sweet’ only for the guest to turn up their nose at it. Not all minigames are this annoying, but some basic directions upfront would be helpful to signal the objective.</p>

<p>In its favour, Tamagotchi Plaza at least runs quite smoothly and looks great. The cutesy characters have a charming innocence to their designs, while the overall friendly, colourful, welcoming aesthetics of the plaza and various shops make navigating it a joy. Plus, fun little touches like a smartphone that you can use to explore texts with the locals and parse character profiles via the apps add a bit to the immersion. All of this runs at a consistent 60fps, rounding out the visual experience and making this <em>look</em> like a game that’s much better than it actually is.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tamagotchi Plaza is a dull, vapid, and utterly unsatisfying minigame collection that rapidly overstays its welcome. Though charming and visually competent, the underlying gameplay is undercooked, unrewarding, and shallow with its ‘free mobile game’-like design.</p>
<p>There may be a valid case here for playing with very young children for some very light and simple entertainment, but even then, the price tag is comically high for the shallowness and quantity of content you’re getting. I’d suggest you steer clear; it’s worth neither your time nor your money.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, a free-to-play mech shooter from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> devs Wargaming, was only revealed last December. An early access release in April this year followed that Keighley Awards cameo, and just three months on, the game's been given a shutdown date.</p>
<p>It's not quite a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>-level speedrun from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">the live-service cradle to the live-service grave</a>, but it's still a pretty quick one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters," Wargaming wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english">an update post</a> on Steam, "You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p>
<p>Wargaming will be keeping the game's servers running for three more months, meaning they'll shut down around October 8th. Between now and then, the devs will be rolling out stuff like custom game support, a game mode that has every mech unlocked so folks can try out any they fancy, and a "farewell tournament" organised via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/steelhunters">game's Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>Our Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-tanks-creators-reveal-steel-hunters-which-isnt-quite-world-of-mechs">saw a bit of Steel Hunters</a> while he was at the Game Awards, and wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>I can’t say I’m blown away by what I’ve seen of Steel Hunters. It’s a cobbling together of genres and sci-fi archetypes that already feels like it’s going to ride principally on the association with World Of Tanks. It seems sturdily-made, however, and I’m kind of charmed by Wargaming’s ridiculous insistence on having their very own word for co-op teamwork – "Duo Symbiosis".</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping the devs and players who made and were digging Steel Hunters can enjoy these final few months with the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steel-hunters-the-mech-shooter-from-world-of-tanks-devs-gets-a-shutdown-date-just-three-months-after-releasing-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-bad-influence-the-dark-side-of-kidfluencing">Patrick Recommends: <em>Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Naturally, every kid would think it'd be cool to be popular on YouTube.</span></figcaption></figure><p>For many parents, the basic question in front of them is: should I share photos of my children online? OK, that’s not a basic question. Does sharing them to Facebook, so aunts and uncles can see them, despite the ills of Facebook, count? But let’s handwave those issues and boil it down to whether or not you are simply going to share digital album photos via text message, or, as most do, use private social accounts.</p><p>My children, however, did not ask to be the children of a journalist. Nor did I anticipate that becoming a parent would suddenly create a rich resource of ideas to report on, which is why I ended up starting off <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Crossplay</em></a> in the wake of <em>Waypoint</em>’s implosion. I found myself asking questions about screen time, video games, and technology that I couldn’t find good answers for online, so I ultimately decided the best way to answer them was for me to answer them myself.</p><p>But I also set rules for myself. I don’t use their names. (Instead, I refer to them as oldest/youngest or their ages.) I generally do not publish pictures, and if a picture is unavoidable in order to explain what’s going on, their faces are blurred. I’ll share personal stories, but if it feels <em>too</em> personal, especially with my oldest, then that one is kept inside the family. I’ve slipped up here and there, but in general, I’m trying to use our experiences without <em>exploiting</em> them.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, I’m walking a fine line. But in watching <em>Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing</em>, you witness a bunch of parents and deeply exploited children springing past any semblance of a line. Watch and scream as a bunch of parents convince themselves what their kids are doing, what they’re <em>allowing</em> their kids to do, is both safe and creatively worthy endeavour. It has nothing to do with all the money it’s bringing in for everyone, while the algorithm consumes.</p><p>But even in my line of work, I can see how you can start convincing yourself “well, that’s okay,” because it’s true that the more personal you get, the more people respond. ("Personal" posts drive more subs.) It’s a combination of the parasocial and the algorithm, but in my most charitable moments, I can see how people climb a ladder that ends in exploitation, rather than executing malice in search of profit.</p><p>I don’t think it’s a perfect documentary and lets the parents off the hook, but it’s a worthwhile look at what’s happening on places like YouTube. It’s an extreme example, perhaps, but when you start walking backwards, you start seeing versions of this behavior all over the place, in which parents use their children if not for profit, then <em>attention</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-baseball">Rob Recommends: Baseball?</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@punttim?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Tim Gouw</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Every year I fall in love with the baseball playoffs and think, “I should watch more regular season games.” And every year I make it a few weeks into the season before I go, “Actually, the hell with that.” Except this year, I’m <em>loving </em>America’s pastime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Live-service game development has become the ultimate gamble for any publisher. If you get a hit, you’re set—money will pour in for as long as you can surf the wave. If you miss, countless millions are lost forever. Most of them miss. The latest game to spectacularly fail to be a long-running cash cow is <em>Steel Hunters</em>, the extraction shooter released into Early Access just three months ago by <em>World of Tanks</em> creators Wargaming. It’ll be gone for good by October.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Properly revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/slides/23">during last December’s Game Awards</a></span>, <em>Steel Hunters</em> looked like it was going to be a spectacular mech combat game, with heavy <em>Transformers</em> vibes. Sure, it’s a terrible title, but it matches the utilitarian naming conventions of Wargaming, renowned for <em>World of Tanks </em>and <em>World of Warplanes</em>. The early footage looked incredible, and everyone loves a stompy robot online shooter, so given Wargaming’s history of enormous success it seemed like a reasonably safe bet.</p><p>But nope. Since <em>Steel Hunters</em> launched into Early Access April 2, it peaked at fewer than 4,500 players, and hasn’t managed over 1,000 concurrent players since April 18. And let’s stress: this is a free-to-play game, that hadn’t even added in-app purchases. At the time of writing, this free, live-service PvPvE shooter has 34 players online. Its peak so far in July is 138. It is a <em>colossal</em> flop.</p><p>Of the nearly 4,000 reviews on Steam, just 58 percent are positive, meaning <em>Steel Hunters</em> sits very firmly in the doomed Mixed territory. And while judgement is usually reserved when it comes to Early Access games, players had less reason to hope for significant change given the Steam page statement that the current build “represents a polished foundation of <em>Steel Hunters. </em>It includes the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression system that provide a strong starting point for players.”</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340?emclan=103582791474864271&amp;emgid=527598784391155504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update added to Steam</a></span> July 8 explained that the game is not going to last. Titled “Sunsetting,” it begins, “Today we share difficult news.”</p><p>Addressing presumably the couple of hundred people still playing, Wargaming explains, “we’ve made the decision to sunset <em>Steel Hunters</em>. You’ve given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we’ve come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn’t the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><p>It’s not being immediately switched off, however. Servers will remain online for another 90 days, and there are even plans to roll out custom game support, as well as unlocking all the game’s Hunters for people to play as—including some that were obviously intended to be added later.</p><p>If it had been hoped that the announcement might cause a rush return of players to make the most of the closing months, that’s been dashed. There were fewer players Tuesday than Monday. </p><p>The game itself is said to be fine. That’s perhaps the most damning element here. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/steel-hunters-is-like-a-more-tactical-titanfall-but-as-an-extraction-shooter-its-undermined-by-boring-loot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/steel-hunters-is-like-a-more-tactical-titanfall-but-as-an-extraction-shooter-its-undermined-by-boring-loot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em> described it as</a></span> “a more tactical <em>Titanfall</em>,” let down by poor loot and feeling too early, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamingbolt.com/steel-hunters-early-access-review-middle-of-the-food-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamingbolt.com/steel-hunters-early-access-review-middle-of-the-food-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gaming Bolt</em> said</a></span> a confusion of genres and muddled progression were the downsides of a fun, destructive game. But there’s just no room left in the fiercely competitive world of live-service games to be average. You have to be a massive, all-consuming success, or you’re doomed to “sunset” after a handful of months.</p><p><em>Steel Hunters</em> was created by Wargaming’s UK studio, DPS Games. We reached out to find out if this might lead to any job losses at Wargaming, which has an astonishing 15 studios around the world, and received the following statement:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Wargaming has made the difficult decision to sunset Steel Hunters project. We are committed to supporting our talented team and will work to find suitable roles for as many employees as possible within the company. We sincerely thank the Steel Hunters community for their passion and support throughout the project.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steel-hunters-wargaming-world-of-tanks-live-service-1851785861]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Lunar Software has given an update on the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a>, the long-awaited retro-futuristic sci-fi horror game. As part of this,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700"> they’ve shared some new screenshots</a> of the game to whet your appetites once more, as well as some news about the soundtrack and Mick Gordon’s involvement.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the bad news, which is that Mick Gordon is no longer composing for the game. “In July 2024 Mick made the difficult decision to leave the project because of conflicts in his schedule,” the team writes. But all is not lost. “During his time with us, Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for ROUTINE. These contributions will now be implemented by a new audio designer and team.”</p>


<p>On to the good-ish news. Writing together as a three-person team, Lunar’s Aaron, Jemma and Pete say:</p>
<p>“We know it’s been a while since our last update. Working on ROUTINE has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing ROUTINE. But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>



<p>“In short, ROUTINE is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>We actually got to see a little snippet of gameplay recently when visiting Raw Fury, with the message being that the game was coming towards its final stages.</p>

		
		

<p>Until their next update, which hopefully won’t be quite so far away, they have a few screenshots to share from Union Plaza. This is a struggling tourist attraction on the Moon with the Living Quarters, Arcade and Mall all featured. It was within this Mall that we saw our gameplay snippet, using a strange video cassette gun to reveal secret messages, using dark light splatter to detect fingers on an interactive panel, and more. It was just a brief demo, though.</p>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">The last update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-enhances-xenoblade-chronicles-series-image-quality-and-performance-but-patches-are-still-very-much-needed.1239108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Playing the Xenoblade Chronicles series on Nintendo Switch 2 seems to be the way to enjoy Monolith Soft's excellent RPGs at their best, but the system's backward compatibility feature's image quality and performance improvements are still not enough to make them truly shine.</p>



<p>A new analysis shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NinWRTV">Nintendo World Report </a>on YouTube takes a look at how all the entries in the series run on Nintendo Swicth 2, starting with Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition, the game that runs the best on the original Switch. On the new generation system, the remaster of the Wii U entry in the series maxes out the dynamic resolution range seen on the Switch, running at locked 1080p and 720p resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, with solid image quality.</p>



<p>Things are much different in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. While the second entry in the series remains one of the most impressive Switch games ever, thanks to its advanced visual features like high quality character models and post-processing and the volumetric sea of clouds, these features came at a heavy cost in terms of resolution and framerate, which are very low on the original Switch. On Nintendo Switch 2, the game fares a little better, as it runs at locked 720p and 576p resolutions, the maximum possible resolution in the game's dynamic resolution ranges, in docked and handheld modes, but still with the same TAA solution and sharpening filter, which heavily impact image quality. The game's expansion fares a little better thanks to the less aggressive sharpening filter, but resolutions remain low. Performance, at least, becomes more solid with a locked 30 FPS framerate. Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch 2 fares not too differently from its sequel,  with locked 720p and 576p resolutions, and slightly better image quality thanks to the absence of the infamous sharpening filter.,</p>



<p>Better tailored to the capabilities of the original Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's image quality was considerably better than its predecessor's, also thanks to improved temporal upscaling. On Nintendo Switch 2, the third entry in the series runs at docked 720p resolution, but only at 480p resolution in handheld mode, which makes sense considering how this resolution scaled to 720p and 1080p, but ends up making the game's handheld mode on Switch 2 the worst out of all entries in the series.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While even these minor improvements are welcome, there's no denying that dedicated Nintendo Switch 2 patches would be quite welcome to make the Xenoblade Chronicles series shine on the system. Hopefully, they will receive the same treatment as other Switch games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">Splatoon 3</a>, which has been massively improved on the new system with a resolution boost of up to six times.</p>

            <p>I'm a month late on this, but since we don't appear to have written about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kenshi">Kenshi</a> for about six years, I figured this was worth highlighting. Chris Hunt and Natalie Mikkelson of Lo-Fi Games recently put out a video chatting about Kenshi 2, their approach to design and, uh, their shared hatred for fondue. It's a lovely, unadorned look at game development, with Hunt and Mikkelson talking through how they basically learned to do everything on the fly, from Kenshi's beginnings to Lo-Fi Games's current size of 30 people.</p>

<p>Hunt describes Kenshi as about "a sort of philosophical idealism that you can overcome anything if you keep working hard, and improving, and training. And that's how I would love the world to be."</p>
<p>As for Kenshi 2, Hunt shares some bits and pieces we've already heard. The map will be around twice the size, but the game will be set in the same area as Kenshi, just 1000 years before. "The same location, but very different," says Hunt. "Different civilisations, different factions. You'll get a preview of the old empire and how things were."</p>
<p>"The whole point of travelling is that you go somewhere with a different culture," Hunt continues. "Different rules of survival, different dangers. It makes you want to travel. See what's out there".</p>
<p>They're later asked if the hundreds of hours Kenshi's players frequently spend with the game surprised them.</p>
<p>"I feel like my work now is more geared towards people playing it for that long", says Mikkelson. "So you're trying to make things not repeatable. So I find, for Kenshi 2, we're more aware now of people spending that amount of time, so we can try and adapt to it. So that people can play it that long, and it doesn't repeat and stuff."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I mean, I designed the game to be addictive like that," says Hunt. "But addictive in a good way. You can have evil addiction and good addiction. Evil is like, a typical free-to-play, 'maximise engagement' type of mentality from the designer. My type of addiction is, you're addicted because you're having fun. You're encountering problems and challenges. And even when you're away from the game, you're thinking of this challenge. Maybe you're at work and you're thinking 'how am I gonna get my guy back from those slavers?"</p>

<p>Which I found a little funny in a sort of "no, this is the <em>healthy crack</em>, you cretin," way, but then again Kenshi <em>is</em> very cheap <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/">on Steam at the moment</a>. </p>
<p>As for why they're not showing much work-in-progress for Kenshi 2, Hunt says that keeping things quiet for as long as possible just makes development easier. "Once a game goes into the public eye, you get pressure, certain obligations and potential problems". This way, they can change things, make mistakes, go back on things. "Things aren't always made in the order that looks best for marketing," Hunt says, adding that a lot of the game is basic models right now, since that gives them the flexibility to change things.</p>
<p>"If we've said too much, that weakens our impact," says Mikkelson. "At the end of the day, we want to make more games. We need to do things properly and be patient, so that we succeed. Kenshi is a game about exploration and discovery. At least with my work, I don't want to say anything about it, because it ruins the whole player's experience of discovering that for themselves."</p>
<p>"Even once we're fully showing the game, a lot of our best stuff, we'll be holding it back," says Hunt. "There's a lot of stuff I consider spoilers that maybe a normal company wouldn't."</p>
<p>They're also asked at one point to choose between Kenshi's robot companion <a href="https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Agnu">Agnu</a> and Fondue. As in, melted cheese dip. Just as a concept. They are not fans. "I really like cheese but…" says Mikkelson. "Yeah, it shouldn't be liquid" adds Hunt.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lo-fi-games-know-youve-spent-a-billion-hours-with-kenshi-so-theyre-working-on-making-the-sequels-discoveries-even-less-predictable]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft). It's available in early access now for those who pre-ordered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-includes-only-10-tracks-from-original-games-as-focus-shifts-to-new-music]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-group-shifts-to-%E2%80%98franchise-model%E2%80%99-internally-will-be-led-by-ex-halo-veteran.1239081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, we learned that the Dungeons &amp; Dragons group within Wizards of the Coast would shift to a 'franchise model' internally, where everything about the beloved fantasy IP sits under the same roof. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> by Dan Ayoub, a game industry veteran who spent a long time at Microsoft working on the Halo franchise, from Halo: Reach to Halo: Infinite. He left in 2021 to become Vice President at Certain Affinity, though that didn't last long, as he <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-wars-head-dan-ayoub-wizards-of-the-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved again to Wizards of the Coast in 2022</a>, first as VP/Head of Studios and then as Senior VP of Digital Games. Now, Ayoub has been promoted to head the whole Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise:</p>



<p><em>So, what happened today? We shifted our structure internally and D&amp;D moved to a full franchise model, meaning everything: books, video games, film, and TV – everything touching the franchise lives under one roof. The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</em></p>



<p><em>Finally, in a moment that doubtlessly has my childhood self doing cartwheels (and okay, maybe some old man cartwheels too), I've been asked to lead this new group! As of today, I am thrilled, humbled, and somewhat freaked out to be leading the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise for Wizards of the Coast.</em></p>



<p>Ayoub mentioned film and TV, but there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no publicly known plans to create a sequel to Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a>, which only barely recouped its budget, and work on the TV series that was going to air on Paramount+ has been paused.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast does have plenty of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games in the works, though:</p>



<ul>
<li>The digital fantasy tabletop adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out in late 2025;</li>



<li>Project Baxter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a co-op game in development at Starbreeze</a> and scheduled to launch next year;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen;</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The company is also hard at work on the future of the Baldur's Gate series, of course. In March, Dan Ayoub <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-fans-will-know-more-about-the-franchises-future-in-short-order-says-hasbro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> fans of the franchise would know more about what's coming next in 'short order'.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A little bit of Mario Kart trivia for you — what is the one Nintendo track you can't play anywhere but the series' smartphone spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is Piranha Plant Pipeline, a fun, waterslide-esque level set within the bowels of various Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes that for some reason never got ported over into Switch entry Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Tour's lengthy track roster is a mix of classic tracks and new courses that also arrived in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the game's Booster Course Pass. These included Squeaky Clean Sprint, a level partially set in a toilet, and Sky-High Sundae, which was immediately brought back for Switch 2 as part of Mario Kart World's open-world map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the jump to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and because of Mario Kart Tour's rotating track selection it is only rarely playable. Indeed, Nintendo celebrated the track's return with a post <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1942826049639006482%7Ctwgr%5E81d207006539890989a8031d8157fbf376b45753%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FmariokarttourEN%2Fstatus%2F1942826049639006482" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today</a> on X/Twitter, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Life</a> notes that the course's reappearance now marks only the third time it has ever been playable, and its first appearance this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well hello Piranha Plant Pipeline," one fan wrote.

Should Mario Kart Tour ever get retired, Piranha Plant Pipeline will disappear forever with it — so maybe give it a go now, while you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is ready to stick a rusty knife into its distended fleshsack of horror IP collaborations yet again, this time resulting in The Walking Dead splattering wetly onto its gore-soaked floor. We already knew the collaboration was coming, of course, but with its public test build now live, developer Behaviour Interactive has finally detailed exactly what's involved.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration introduces two new survivors, bringing three new perks apiece: Rick Grimes - the man with more hat than personality (until he gave away his hat) - and formidable zombie slayer (plus pointy sword fan) Michonne Grimes.
</p>
<p>
Rick comes with the Apocalyptic Ingenuity perk, which enables him to turn broken pallets into fragile pallets after interacting with a certain number of chests, plus the Come and Get Me perk, which causes Rick to scream, alerting the killer to his aura, but prevents injured or dying survivors from leaving scratch marks or blood trails within a certain radius. Additionally, there's the Toughen Up teamwork perk, which reduces Rick's grunts of pain, scratch marks, and pools of blood when another survivor pallet-stuns or blinds the killer while he's injured.

<p>
As for Michonne, her Conviction perk lets her recover immediately after healing a survivor while downed, but Broken is then applied, downing her again after a certain length of time. Last Stand, meanwhile, is a once-per-trial perk that lets Michonne fast-vault and stun the killer after she's been in its terror radius for a set amount of time. As for her Throw Down teamwork perk, it gives Endurance to other survivors and lets them see the killer's aura briefly when she pallet-stun or blinds the killer. You'll find a few more specifics - alongside details of other updates and enhancements - in Behaviour Interactive's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/538857783458533234?l=english">9.1.0 patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration - which arrives sandwiched between its previously announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's and The Witcher collaborations</a> - can be played right now via the game's public test build on PC, but Behaviour notes Michonne Grimes won't be included due to "known technical issues". Expect these to be resolved, the studio says, in time for update 9.1.0's full release across all platforms on 29th July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9aM9Ch97U8">La jiggy jar jar doo</a>.

			<p>A new Stellar Blade mod now available for download brings significant visual improvements by introducing ray-traced global illumination to the game.</p>



<p>The mod, developed by Atlas813 and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/1227?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, doesn't require any paid shared or third party assets so users don't need anything else other than ReShade to use it. Besides introducing RTGI with proper light bouncing and diffuse lights, the mod introduces ambient light correction, a sharpening effect that only sharpens close objects, among other features that introduce significant visual improvements as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below taken at 1080p resolution, max settings, and NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>
