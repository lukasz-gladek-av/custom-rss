And in <em>Last Epoch</em>, it can take a player anywhere from 25 to 50 hours to fully delve into all of the game’s mechanics and reach the endgame. For that journey, you’re likely to stick with a single class instead of swapping between characters. For Season Two—Tombs of the Erased—I decided to forego my usual spellcaster for something different, the Sentinel. I’m not disappointed in the least bit. In fact, I finally understand spin-to-win!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

With its hard-hitting melee abilities, high defense, health regeneration, and the strength to wield two-handed weapons with immense power, the Sentinel is a top choice for new and returning players alike who want to slaughter mobs with reckless abandon.</p><p>Some of the base skills you’ll want to prioritize as a Sentinel include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Lunge</strong>: “<em>Dash to a nearby enemy and strike it with your weapon.</em>” This is an excellent skill to close the distance with a single target or, more often than not, mobs to sweep up with Warpath.</li><li><strong>Warpath</strong>: “<em>Spin towards the mouse while you hold down the ability key, striking nearby enemies as you move.</em>” With the right weapon and passive points invested, you can clear entire mobs without wasting mana or taking damage.</li><li><strong>Rive</strong>: “<em>Every third consecutive attack with Rive slashes in a full circle around the character, lacerating enemies it hits.</em>” I like to wield Rive as a main ability, especially with bleed capabilities from its passive tree, to help tackle tougher enemies, like elites and bosses.</li></ul><h2 id="h583619"><a id="2"></a>Void Knight Master Class will see you through endgame</h2><figure id="" data-id="b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-recommend-id="image://b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eleventh Hour Games / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-recommend-id="image://b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The combination of Strength and Vitality allows the Void Knight to go toe-to-toe with nearly any enemy in the game, with few exceptions—so long as you place your passive points properly.

It’s an open-world craft-heavy RPG in which you charge around an alien planet, beating up the local flora and fauna, in order to gather their parts to build more effective means of beating up the local flora and fauna. Along the way, there’s the most astonishingly intricate storyline, a vast cast of bonkers characters, and a kerjillion (I counted) items to craft.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>OK, so not much about the above perhaps sounds fantastically original, and sure, I get that. But what makes <em>Crashlands</em> and its recent sequel stand out from the crowd is that it plays like an action-RPG. Combat is very lively, all about getting in a hit, dashing and rolling, throwing in a bomb, mixing up ranged and melee combat, and all from a comfortable isometric view.</p><p>Each enemy type, of which there are approximately infinity, requires a unique tactic, often with two or three of them getting mixed up in a brawl at the same time. That latter situation is the best, because they all want to fight each other as much as they want to kill you, so luring them toward each other can create a splendid showdown, with you lobbing in explosives from the sidelines. There’s rarely a moment when you aren’t whacking at something, whether it’s rocks, plants or vicious creatures, usually while running to your next quest or destination.</p><p>I really encourage you to play both games, but I’m focusing on <em>Crashlands 2</em> today because it came out just last month, and it’s occupied so many of my evenings and spare moments that it just feels silly not to share that with you. It’s one of those games I’m playing purely for pleasure, looking forward to after a busy day of playing other games, and not even thinking about how I could turn it into work (even though I now accidentally have). I’ve accidentally stayed up far too late far too many nights over the last couple of weeks, thinking I’ll just get another couple of quests ticked off, get the ingredients for the next dagger upgrade, and see about clearing out that one robot base, and then discovering it’s somehow&nbsp;2 a.m. and I have the school run in the morning.</p><p>You play as Flux Dabes, an intergalactic trucker who has been screwed over by her corporation, and finds herself (in both games) dumped on an alien planet—Woanope—without the means to leave. She’s once again accompanied by Juicebox, a floating, um, robotic juice carton, who provides color commentary and endless wry remarks, and the two become intricately involved in the lives of the local intelligent lifeforms and their battle against the same corporation you’ve recently quit.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s more extraordinary than anything else about these games is their <em>size</em>. They are so, <em>so</em> big. As you play, your explorable area endlessly grows, gated by the strength of more distant enemies and occasionally by the need to develop means of traveling that you’ve yet to craft. In <em>Crashlands 2</em>, you also build a little home for yourself and your inventive companions packed with research benches for them to work at, where they tirelessly dream up new devices, weapons, nets, bombs, fertilizers, staffs, fishing rods, helmets, wall types, baits, armors, and pieces of decor for you to craft from the billions of items that drop when you hit stuff. Plentiful teleporters mean the ever-growing scale doesn’t become too daunting, and the constant sense of progress is unrelentingly rewarding.</p><p>I really cannot express to you how large this game is. I remember in 2016's <em>Crashlands</em>, thinking I was about to end the game, before discovering I had only explored one landscape out of two. Something similar happened in the sequel, when after a packed 15 hours or so of playing I was wrapping up the storyline, defeating a tougher boss, and thinking I was about to roll credits, only to discover it was teasing me, I wasn’t even halfway. And, crucially, I was delighted! I wasn’t ready for it to be over.</p><figure id="" data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think a large part of why I didn’t want it to be done, even though I’d gone through a satisfying arc that’d be easily worth the entry fee, is because of the game’s constant positive feedback loop. You’re <em>always </em>progressing, always ticking off something from one of its many lists, and each time experiencing a meaningful difference. Beefing up your knuckles weapon, and then equipping it with a bunch of trinkets and buffs that complement it, means thwacking a tricky enemy is going to be much easier. Boosting your HP with new armor makes you feel so much tougher. Crafting a new workbench suddenly opens up your opportunities in multiple directions.  More means more fantastically animated enemy types, more silly story, more quests to complete, more locations to uncover, more boxes to tick and items to craft and progress progress progress.</p><p>Flaws? Well, weirdly—given how much love is poured into it—I would say the writing. It’s really good! It’s just that there’s far too much of it. Conversations to get a new quest can end up going on for 20, 30 exchanges of speech-bubble text, and while it’s all superbly written and often very funny, I find myself frustrated by just wanting to know what I’m supposed to be doing next. I have, I confess, committed the cardinal sin of clicking through it all and then just checking the quest log. I don’t want to! But honestly, <em>Crashlands 2 </em>is so  wildly overwritten. It needed a detached, heartless editor to cut swathes from it, keep the great gags, and get to the point. </p><p>But&nbsp;when that’s my major complaint about such a detailed and expansive game, you know it must be doing an awful lot right. And all of this in a paid-for game that has no in-app purchases or extra fees. These games could be monetized to utter misery, and instead they don’t even dip a toe in that mire.</p><figure id="" data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This does make <em>Crashlands 2</em> that most unusual of games: a mobile app that costs money up front. There’s a PC version too, and it’s splendid, but it’s pricier at $25. (And totally worth it. There’s at least 35 hours of game here!) The iOS/Android version is $10, despite being the same game, and while that discrepancy always feels odd, it’s important to note that mobile prices <em>are</em> just a different market: choosing to charge customers at the point of purchase, rather than exploit them ever-after, can be devastating for attention. As such, rather than the million-plus downloads a game like this would get if it were “free-to-play,” it currently sports “5K+” downloads on Android. I really want to express how this is worth every penny, for me one of the most essential games on my tablet, and how important it is to support excellent games that use non-exploitative payments.</p><p>I really don’t know why this isn’t on Xbox or PS5. It’d be the perfect couch game, absorbing your late evening hours, perfectly paired with a light-hearted podcast.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-of-atlan-launches-may-28-and-shakes-up-mmorpg-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal of Atlan is an action MMORPG from developer VI-Games that wants to put its own unique spin on the gameplay of the genre. It features a focus on class-based build diversity, fast-paced aerial combat, and chaining together abilities to build up your combo meter. It's available to <a href="https://coau.onelink.me/Kb3c/rqg5e02q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">download for free</a> right now, but if you're looking for more info before you dive in, we've got you. Let’s start with the classes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Diverse Class Paths for Personalized Builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five base classes available at launch, all unlocked for free at the start of the game: the melee damage dealing Swordsman, ranged attacker Musketeer, magical Magister, martial artist Fighter, and summoner Puppeteer. Each class branches into specialized subclasses, with a total of 11 subclass options and more than 20 unique abilities to experiment with and tailor to your preferred style.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-1-1747937274930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Swordsman branches into the Magiblade or Berserker. They’re both melee damage dealers, but the Magiblade adds magical abilities (which you could probably guess from the name), and the Berserker can sacrifice health to generate shields and increase power as you get closer to death. Regardless of the subclass you choose, each of the skills you unlock have individual cooldowns. You can mix and match those skills at any time, letting you come up with unique character builds and find skills that chain together well to build combos.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-puppeteer-subclass-1747937366873.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seamless Ground-to-Air Combat Innovation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditional MMO combat focuses on ground-based attacks with a fairly simple stand-and-attack style. Crystal of Atlan differentiates itself by including a heavy focus on the Z-axis, introducing a system that encourages you to seamlessly transition between ground and aerial combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-platforming-1747937405449.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can attack and dodge in mid-air, allowing you to pull off aerial combos and adding a new dimension to each battle and a level of responsiveness to moment-to-moment gameplay. You can jump to avoid attacks, then chain that into aerial combos to keep the pressure on enemies. So you’re rewarded for staying on your toes, reacting quickly, and using all your abilities to fluidly chain attacks together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That focus on ground and air combos also informs the design of Crystal of Atlan’s varied environments. All of the game’s maps, from the fantastical Wonderland to the mechanical Chrome Military Factory, have an open 3D layout to allow freedom of movement. Couple that with smooth animations and you get a combat system that’s fluid and fast-paced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-2-1747937438520.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cooperative Challenges and Social Progression</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from an MMO, there are a variety of dungeons you can tackle with other players. You fight through packs of normal enemies before getting to the end and facing off against a boss with unique mechanics. That’s all pretty standard, but Crystal of Atlan mixes things up by requiring synchronized team coordination.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-3-1747937464007.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are numerous dungeons with interaction-based mechanics that require teamwork to solve problems. Naturally, if your whole group is tackling such a dungeon for the first time, you’ll need to communicate and help each other figure out what to do. Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you can take on a mentor role in future runs, but everyone will always need to work together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a fleet system, which is basically like guilds you’ve probably experienced in other games. It’s a key part of Crystal of Atlan's social ecosystem, allowing you to link up with friends to tackle co-op gameplay together or just hang out and chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Competitive PvP and Creative PvE Challenges</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re the competitive type, there are also options for PvP combat. There are 1v1 and 3v3 battles, with attributes, skill damage, and skill cooldowns balanced so there’s no competitive advantage. It’s all about skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Crystal of Atlan is an MMO at heart, it has plenty of content for solo players too. In classic MMO style, there are hub areas where you can see lots of other players. These areas are where you’ll find quests to complete and new zones to explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-magiblade-subclass-1747937517467.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure Mode takes you through the game’s main story, which unlocks in stages. You can tackle these stages solo, and they have a variety of different goals. Some will be focused on combat, where you need to defeat groups of enemies or take on a boss. Others introduce new elements, like requiring you to use stealth to sneak past enemies or use platforming to progress through the area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other modes you can tackle solo or co-op. The main one is the Arena, where you can fight alone or with a partner and gradually work your way up through tiers of opponents, earning escalating rewards as you do. If you manage to get through all the tiers, you can reach the Finals for the ultimate reward.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-4-1747937545618.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To sum it all up, Crystal of Atlan is an MMORPG that mixes together classic staples of the genre with evolved gameplay to keep things fun, fast, and fluid. It launches May 28 on PC, PS5, iOS, and Android, with crossplay across all platforms. The PS5 version has an optimized HUD layout to avoid clutter and utilizes the haptic feedback of the DualSense controller. It also has a remapped UI for controller input, using a function wheel you’re probably familiar with from other games. There’s HDR support for enhanced lighting, and PSSR is enabled on the PS5 Pro for sharper visuals and more stable frame rates.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/crystal-of-atlan-ps5-command-wheel-1747849581064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info on the world, classes, and features of Crystal of Atlan, you can check out <a href="https://coa.nvsgames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">the official website</a>.

In a <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?si=edC8QP_C_CzmTl5N" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 2023 interview with IGN</a>, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard said Skyrim had sold over 60 million copies. So, we now have a potential tie for the best-selling role-playing game of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt launched in May 2015, and recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary. Here’s Adam Badowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, on The Witcher 3 sales milestone:</p><blockquote>Without a doubt, the third part of Geralt’s adventures marks a pivotal point in our history. The game earned hundreds of awards and solidified our studio’s standing, but more importantly, it brought untold hours of adventures and emotions to millions of games the world over. I am proud to announce that since its release The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a place among the bestselling video games in all history, and motivating us to carry on with intensive work on the next trilogy set in this universe.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to The Witcher 4, which is currently in full production. 422 out of 730 developers at CD Projekt are working on the sequel, which won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">hit back at criticism of <u>The Witcher 4</u> focusing on Ciri</a> — and told so-called fans of the franchise to "read the damn books."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's just stupid," Cockle said of the backlash against The Witcher 4, sparked due to it featuring Ciri as its protagonist for the first time instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not woke," Cockle continued, speaking during a video published by <a href="https://youtu.be/Ufg-mhMsR7o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fall Damage</u></a>. "There's nothing woke about it.

She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be.

"I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They, presumably, are Atlus, though the company has yet to officially confirm a Persona 4 remake is in the works. We have reached out to Sega/Atlus for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game actors under SAG-AFTRA are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">still on strike</a> over issues including AI protections. While Lowenthal is a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1r-wDSLqp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAG-AFTRA member</a>, it's unclear whether that played a part in casting. However, the organization continues to press for protections for its actors, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-its-still-frustratingly-far-apart-from-games-industry-bargaining-group-on-ai-protections">a March statement saying</a> they are still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite any official confirmation, rumors have swirled around a potential Persona 4 remake for a while.

After the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, a Persona 4 remake would make a fair bit of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when it might happen, Persona 3 Reload was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-remake-officially-announced-during-xbox-games-showcase">announced in the summer of 2023</a>, during Xbox's Game Showcase for that year.

The majority of the staff (422) is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>, which is in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Several weeks ago the CD Projekt Red team responsible for the next big game set in the Cyberpunk universe completed the project’s conceptual phase," CD Projekt said. "As a result, Cyberpunk 2 – previously known under the codename Project Orion – has progressed to pre-production."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is pre-production ? In the world of AAA development, pre-production can involve everything from fleshing out concepts to planning full production, building prototypes to staffing up studios. It can often take years to complete.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an investor call following the release of the company's financial report, CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski responded to the suggestion Cyberpunk 2 won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031, and Nowakowski failed to rule that release window out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can reiterate in a way what I said in one of the previous calls, which was basically that our journey from pre-production to final release takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having said that, keep in mind that each project is unique, and there are many variables that influence the final outcome. So I will not lead you into specific years, but yes, this is pretty much how it looks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2 still sounds a long way off, then. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest">so does The Witcher 4</a>. But we at least now know what CD Projekt is calling the game, after it was referred to previously as its codename, Orion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know next to nothing about Cyberpunk 2, but earlier this month <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases">Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</a>. Pondsmith, who worked closely with CD Projekt on the 30 million-selling Cyberpunk 2077 and was involved in promoting the game ahead of its 2020 launch, was asked about the scope of his involvement with Orion at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding, Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’ "</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/gsc9ih5xeaag1w8-1748448149834.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">96 developers at CD Projekt are working on Cyberpunk 2. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the <em>feel</em> of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also already some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable. There are a lot of unknowns, but it looks like there may be two fleshed out playable cities in this sequel at the very least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely busy time for CD Projekt, of course. There’s a new Cyberpunk animation project on Netflix following the well-received Cyberpunk: Edgerunners in the works. In the shorter term, Cyberpunk 2077 is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/handmaids-tale-finale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-handmaid%E2%80%99s-tale-is-finally-over-except-it-isn%E2%80%99t.1200885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/handmaids-tale-finale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The series finale of Hulu’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> aired last night, finally putting the Elisabeth Moss-fronted adaptation of Maragret Atwood’s novel out of its misery after six seasons. When the show first started in 2017, it felt chillingly appropriate for the horrors of the first Trump administration; the finale felt appropriate not to the second Trump administration, but to our current age of franchises.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for </strong><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong><strong> finale and previous seasons.)</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Handmaid's Tale | Final Season Trailer | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBBRUdLBsFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’ll sum up how we got to the finale by quoting from what I wrote in our newsletter in mid-April:</p><blockquote><p>…over the seasons, especially as the show moved away from its setting of Gilead, I think it lost what made it powerful. In my mind, one of the biggest problems is that, despite being set in a world with such clear power structures and such high stakes, there are few consequences for any of its main characters. Protagonist June does more and more rebellious and ostentatious acts, but nothing ever <em>happens </em>to her; she is somehow immune to Gilead's power in ways that became less about her own resolve or resourcefulness and more, it felt, about the show needing to just not kill off Elisabeth Moss' character. This made the show grow repetitive and toothless.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>While earlier seasons felt like they deftly showcased Gilead’s might and the ways people were able to claim their power in its cracks, by the end of the series June was traipsing back and forth across the border with impunity. Gilead felt like it lost its threat, even for the people who still lived there. In the finale, this lack of consequences extends to other characters: Janine is captured by Gilead in the previous episode, but we worry about her fate for about 20 minutes before she’s released. The long-running conflict between Janine and Naomi, who has Janine’s daughter, is hastily resolved by Naomi just giving Janine the child back, with no time spent on what happens to Naomi now that she’s two times a widow in a failing empire. Aunt Lydia, who was facing death after denouncing Gilead in the previous episode, is somehow not just fine but back in power.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of plotlines for the finale to wrap up, but instead it eats up much of its hour runtime with flashbacks to June’s pre-Gilead life with daughter Hannah and with a mortifying fantasy sequence where June and all the women she’s met sing karaoke together. It then has to rush through its actual story, giving us passionless conversations between June and the people in her life. June forgives Serena Joy, drawing on a heavy-handed religiosity that got hammered into season six (“maybe the good guys can also have religion” is an idea I would definitely be here for, but the show mostly employs it for zingers in conversation rather than exploring the idea with any depth.). June and Luke break up, sort of maybe. June’s mother and her daughter arrive from Alaska (on… busses? Through a warzone?) only for June to immediately leave again, in pursuit of Hannah who has conveniently been moved from Colorado to DC.&nbsp;</p><p>All this feels like setup for the TV adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Testaments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Testaments</em></a>, Atwood’s 2019 sequel. That show’s creators say it takes place <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/05/27/the-testaments-tv-show-the-handmaids-tale/83727966007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15 years</a> after <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, but its narrative centers around life in an oppressive, post-June Gilead that still has teeth, putting it in conflict with the timeline <em>The Handmaid’s Tale </em>pursued once it ran out of book to adapt. It needs the door to be left open on several of <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s characters–Aunt Lydia, June and Nick’s daughter Nicole, Luke and June’s daughter Hannah–, some of whom have to be older but still under Gilead’s thumb. So <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> has to leave some of its biggest questions unresolved, something I would have found acceptable if the show had leaned into subtlety in the rest of its plotting. But the show got so uncomfortable with ambiguity over the seasons that the finale just felt like its creators trying to have things both ways, slamming the book closed on some stories while leaving others open.</p><p>The worst thing I think <em>The Testaments</em> adaption could do is bring June back into it (the creators have been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-handmaids-tale-series-finale-june-hannah-ending-explained-1236229967/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vague</a> on if she’ll appear.). So much of what I feel went wrong with <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> was its focus on making June more and more powerful– I <em>lost it</em> this season when June, <em>the most famous woman in the world</em>, managed to go unrecognized in Gilead while disguised as a handmaid, <em>the outfit everyone recognizes her in</em>. For me, the most interesting part of the show was Gilead itself, what it believed and how it functioned, how different people would find meaning in its oppressive structures and their different relationships to it. Returning the focus to Gilead is a good move for <em>The Testaments</em>, not just because I am a sucker for any media about weird religions, but because that’s where <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s strongest tensions and most interesting stories came from. But June as a character should have died seasons ago (she almost does in the penultimate episode of season six, but only for about five minutes before we’re done with that!); the show’s handling of her has dragged the whole series down. And while we badly do not need more <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>–the show got itself into this mess by refusing to end, running out of things to do but nevertheless persisting–if we <em>must</em>, the best thing it can do is tell stories without June in the mix.</p><p>If this is the end of June’s story, it ends in the most embarrassing way possible. Throughout the finale, characters tell June she should write a book. For the show’s narrative, this makes no sense: Surely her escape from Gilead was a global news story; the world knows what happened to her when she testified at the Waterfords’ Canadian trial in season four; and even the argument that she needs to tell the stories of the other handmaids is unnecessary given all the letters that Mayday snuck to Luke in season two, which caused an international incident. Mentions of a book feel like the most unsubtle reminder that <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> was a book in the first place, and that tale itself was a manuscript smuggled out of Gilead. But of course June has no need for smuggling and illicit written words at this point, making the existence of such a book even more powerless. Like so much of the show, there is nothing a book by June needs to do, nothing for it to say that hasn’t already been said.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time the idea of June writing a book came up, I texted a friend who was slightly ahead of me in the episode that if the show ended with June signing copies of <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> at some bookstore full of women I would fully lose my mind. Luckily, it doesn’t do that, instead ending with June in her burnt-out room in the Waterfords’ home, dictating the voiceover that began the series. This was clearly meant to be some kind of triumphant full circle moment, but it fell flat for me given how far the show has moved from the Waterfords’ house and how fully June has since vanquished them. Like the destroyed house itself, there’s nothing left here for any of the show’s characters, no catharsis or emotion left to wring out. Even the ostensibly rebellious act of writing a book other women in Gilead might read has no power given that women were allowed to read in the liberal enclave of New Bethlehem (What was life like there? What happened to it?), making a book's existence in an unchanged Gilead a minor fact of its history. I can already imagine a plotline in <em>The Testaments</em> where women pass a copy of June’s book around, but given everything she’s done in <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, such a thing would land more like sharing a news story than some triumph of the human spirit.</p><p>I feel a bit for <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s creators and the many corners they wrote themselves into; I’m not sure how I would have extricated myself in a way that would please audiences and whatever demands Hulu made on the production. The best way for the show to end would have been for it to <em>end</em>, except it isn’t. Despite spending a whole blog railing against the show, I know I won’t be able to keep myself from watching <em>The Testaments</em> whenever it ultimately airs. Here’s hoping the show’s creators use it to learn from <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>'s fumbles.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is launching on 16th October 2025 for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced.</p>
<p>The company also confirms that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Switch 2 Edition, which brings improved graphics and frame rates, will be available as a higher priced version of the game. Those who buy the Nintendo Switch version of the game, both digital or physical, will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition. Curiously, it seems that the Switch 2 version is compatible to Switch, which I’m not 100% sure how this will work with the physical edition.</p>


<p>Here’s TPC’s specific wording:</p>
<p><em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the Nintendo Switch 2 title Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be available. With the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you can enjoy improved graphics and frame rates.</em></p>
<p><em>If you own the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, you can upgrade it to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by purchasing an upgrade pack, whether you own the digital version or the physical version of the software. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch system. When playing the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on Nintendo Switch, the content will be the same as that of the Nintendo Switch software. Additional content that utilizes the specs of Nintendo Switch 2 will not be included.</em></p>

<p>No pricing details have been announced at this time, but paid upgrades of this scope – namely Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a £8 / $10 price difference</a>.</p>
<p>The second Legends spin-off after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Arceus</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes us back to Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y. The city is undergoing a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. This means there’s Wild Zones within the city where Pokémon are allowed to thrive behind locked gates… until pesky trainers of a high enough level stomp in and start chucking Poké Balls at everything that moves and fighting them!</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-brings-real-time-battles-and-mega-evolutions-coming-late-2025/">Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y</a> with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-more-dangerous-after-dark-with-the-z-a-royale-battles/">a day-night cycle</a>, with things getting much trickier after dark. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>

			<p>Today, CD Projekt RED has <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2025-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> its Q1 2025 financial report and revealed updates on its games, both those already out (for sales) and those on the way (for development news), such as Cyberpunk 2.</p>
<p>The sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, previously known as Project Orion, has officially entered the pre-production phase at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston-based North American office</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent expansion</a> to Cyberpunk 2077, Phantom Liberty, has sold over 10 million units since its debut in September 2023. As for the studio's other big franchise, The Witcher, the third and most successful entry in the franchise has now surpassed 60 million units sold just as the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated its tenth anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>Presenting the successful quarterly results, CD Projekt RED Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said:</p>
<p><em>On 5 June Cyberpunk Ultimate Edition will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, marking the global launch of the console itself. The game takes full advantage of the console’s new features – weapons can now be aimed gyroscopically, and touchscreen interaction is supported. For the first time ever one of our games is a launch title for a brand-new console system – which we regard as a great honor, as well as further proof of the power of our brand and our partners’ trust in us.</em></p>
<p><em>On the subject of Night City – the Phantom Liberty expansion has reached another sales milestone, having been purchased by 10 million gamers. This is an excellent result, given that only 20 months have passed since its release, and it confirms sustained interest in the Cyberpunk universe on the part of the gaming community. Given these developments, it fills me with even greater satisfaction to announce another important stage in our work on the next big game in this franchise. Several weeks ago, Cyberpunk 2 – previously referred to as Project Orion – wrapped up its conceptual phase and entered preproduction. Congratulations to the entire team!</em></p>
<p><em>Moving on to our other franchise – on 19 May we celebrated a major anniversary, with 10 years having passed since the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game brought thrilling adventures and emotions to millions of games worldwide, and earned us hundreds of awards, along with global recognition. We are proud to announce that since its launch The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a firm position among the best-selling video games in history. It’s also worth mentioning that our aggregate revenues from sales of The Witcher 3 – along with its expansions – have reached 2 billion 400 million PLN over the past decade. The success and enduring popularity of The Witcher 3 fill us with even greater motivation as we work on Ciri’s new adventures in the upcoming The Witcher 4.</em></p>
<p><em>Regarding financials, in the first three months of the year our consolidated sales revenues topped 226 million PLN. This is mainly due to continuing strong sales of Cyberpunk and its Phantom Liberty expansion. The Group’s net Q1 profit reached 86 million PLN.</em></p>
<p>As usual, CD Projekt RED also provided an update on its workforce. The total number of employees grew in the last quarter from 707 to 730, with 422 developers working on The Witcher 4 (+11), 96 developers on Cyberpunk 2 (+12), 48 developers on the multiplayer spin-off Project Sirius (-1), 19 developers on the new IP Project Hadar (+2), 131 developers on 'shared services' (+7), and 14 on other projects (-8).</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 entered pre-production in May 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduated to full production</a> a few months ago. Given this timescale, we can estimate that Cyberpunk 2 could enter full production somewhere around late 2027.</p>
<p>In other recent news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature Night City as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Chicago gone wrong'</a>, according to setting creator Mike Pondsmith.</p>

The way he explains it, the upcoming <em>Death Stranding </em>adaptations will be more inspired by the game, rather than a faithful retelling.</p><p>“When it comes to film adaptations of games,” Kojima told <em>Vogue</em> (via machine translation), “there have been recent [shows] like <em>The Last of Us</em> that keep the plot of the original intact, and films like <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> that are more like a service to game fans. Each of these works has its own merits, but as a film lover, I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema.”</p><p>It’s at this point in the interview that Kojima makes the first mention of this anime project. “I am aiming to make <em>Death Stranding</em> in a way that can only be done as a film, and that will win awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival. In fact, we are also currently working on an anime adaptation.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Kojima has brought one his video game properties into the world of anime. <em>Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I </em>was an anime series released from the world of his gorgeous multi-console third-person shooter <em>Zone of the Enders </em>back in 2001. An anime prequel film, <em>Zone of the Enders: 2167 Idolo</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>was released six months prior.</p><p>No release date or timeline has been announced. Still, it’s exhilarating to know that one of the most innovative visual storytellers of our time is continuing to expand his creative horizons.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>Extremely early development on Cyberpunk 2 began several years ago, and pre-production generally means that more pieces need to fall in place--from concept art to staffing and multiple other crucial factors--before work kicks off in earnest.</p><p>The game title could also change in time, but that's hardly uncommon in the industry today. The Cyberpunk 2 title reveal was done during an investor announcement after all--suggesting that this is in fact a working title that doesn't give away any concrete details--and a formal reveal for the game could see that title altered to better reflect what the sequel is about.</p><p>CDPR described Cyberpunk 2 as being in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along/1100-6520849/">"early stages of development,"</a> back in 2024, as the company first focused on building a strong foundation for the people tasked with producing it. Senior staffers from the original game--including game director Gabriel Amatangelo and associate game director Paweł Sasko--are leading development at CDPR's new Boston studio, and the company has hired experienced people from Blizzard, IO Interactive, and Massive Entertainment to join the Cyberpunk 2 team.</p><p>Details are slim at this point in the game's development journey, but what we do know is that it will be built inside of Unreal Engine 5--Cyberpunk 2077 was developed in CDPR's internal Red Engine--and Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/">players will get to explore a second city in some capacity</a>.</p><p>While Cyberpunk 2 is still a long way from being seen, the first game and its award-winning expansion Phantom Liberty are being bundled together as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, which will likely add to the game's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-cyberpunk-2077-has-earned-so-far/1100-6522250/">impressive lifetime sales figure of 25 million units sold</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russian-military-backed-squad-22-zov-wants-to-show-the-complexities-of-the-ukraine-war.1200795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/squad-22-zov-russian-military-propaganda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>, a tactical RTS that appears to have the official support of the Russian military, has appeared on Steam, and although it's free to play, that very fact is arguably pretty concerning.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simulation Daily</a>, the game claims to be based on the "real wartime experience of living Russian veterans of war in Ukraine". Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>'s developers say it's "officially recommended by the Russian military" as a basic training tool.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>is a tactical strategy game in which you must issue orders to your squad, presumably as they invade Ukrainian towns and villages and ransack the homes of innocent civilians. It's not the best look in the world for Steam, I'd argue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=Jq7mTYWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=zAnI1JS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>aims to depict the Russia-Ukraine war from, er, the Russian side. Right.</figcaption></figure><p>Tellingly, developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment say that the game offers the chance to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". I'm not sure if it's deliberate that the date range doesn't include the current year.</p>

<p>In case you're not aware, those dates refer to the 2014 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26686949" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annexation of Crimea</a> by Russia, then 2022's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60454795" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine, referred to by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a "special military operation". It's not exactly the most creative euphemism in the world.</p>

<p>Said invasion led to various studios voicing their opposition to Russia in several ways, with companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-suspends-warhammer-sales-in-russia" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-halts-sales-in-russia-and-belarus-over-invasion" rel="nofollow">Bloober Team</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-red-halts-sales-with-russia-and-belarus" rel="nofollow">CD Projekt</a> halting sales in Russia and Belarus owing to the event.</p>

<p>The two studios say the game gives you the opportunity to "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions".</p>

<p>Of course, I highly doubt that&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>includes any Ukrainian viewpoints on the situation; given that it's endorsed by the Russian military, I can't imagine that organization condoning any kind of game that attempts to be that even-handed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=jCdqiYZM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=AmEQDWJi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>promises to depict Russia's incursions into Ukraine, for some reason.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of this wasn't bad enough,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>also utilizes generative AI, and the game's description of the way in which this was achieved is a head-scratcher.</p>

<p>SPN Studio says "some 2D images in game where [sic] pre-rendered with usage of AI as a base for work of our 2D artists", with those images "later drawn-over in order to make them geniue [sic] art". I don't think that's how "genuie" art works.</p>

                <p>Work has begun on a new "major" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic project, according to Blizzard. As a result, development on Season of Discovery looks to be coming to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-from-the-wow-classic-team/2110944" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, WoW Classic producer Josh "Aggrend" Greenfield explained what's next for the WoW Classic team and dove into its philosophy behind the more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers that launched in 2023</a>, and what comes next.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Season of Discovery was a success beyond our wildest imagination in 2023," Greenfield said. "We learned so much, we grew as a team both literally and figuratively, and we've been invigorated for the future like never before. That future for Season of Discovery is somewhat bittersweet, as we've made the decision to slow down on Season of Discovery and begin work on our next major project in the original WoW design space."</p><p dir="ltr">He said Blizzard has "big plans and big ambitions" for its next WoW Classic project, plans that will require Blizzard to take the time to "get in the proverbial kitchen and cook," he said. Blizzard will use that time to further shape and iterate on ideas from Season of Discovery into "something truly exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">What that next major project will be is still unclear, but many WoW Classic fans are assuming (and hoping) it's what the community, and even Blizzard itself, has for years referred to as Classic+. It's an idea that calls for essentially a new version of WoW Classic with new content like class changes, raids, and zones. Rather than progress to a new expansion and landmass as was the case originally, Classic+ would remain in the core regions of Azeroth and explore locations that never made it into the original version of WoW, like Mount Hyjal and others. In theory, it's something that would be similar to Season of Discovery, but less radical in some of its class changes and intended to continue as an ongoing game rather than a seasonal server meant to run its course.</p><p dir="ltr">Greenfield said the original plan for Season of Discovery, which added new abilities and content to the over 20-year-old original version of WoW, was for it to end with the release of the game's retooled Naxxramas raid and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-famous-pieces-of-cut-content-is-playable-today/1100-6529076/" data-ref-id="1100-6529076">introduction of a new dungeon, the Karazhan Crypts</a>, in January 2025. Instead, the team decided to realize one more unfulfilled dream, releasing an entirely new raid several months later, the Scarlet Enclave.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that new raid where Blizzard is now offering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-away-free-wow-classic-mists-of-pandaria-boosts-but-youll-have-to-earn-it/1100-6531833/" data-ref-id="1100-6531833">free level 85 character boost to use in the upcoming Mists of Pandaria Classic</a> for players who defeat its first boss. Greenfield said the character boost serves as a "capstone" for Season of Discovery and a way for players to jump straight into a new version of Classic now that Season of Discovery development is winding down. While development is slowing for Season of Discovery, Greenfield said it has no plans to shut down servers, and that they will remain online for many months if not years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we think of the impact that Season of Discovery will ultimately have on World of Warcraft, we think about how it helped prove something that a lot of us already knew: there is an enormous appetite for new experiences set against the backdrop of original World of Warcraft," Greenfield said.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite - Galactic Battle Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In the lead-up to the event, Epic Games is providing players with several new goodies and toys to use in battle. Following an update scheduled for May 29, players can enter rift gates in Battle Royale or Zero Build modes to take control of a Star Destroyer's Turbolaser. Players will fire the destructive weapon from orbit, destroying any structures and damaging opponents that its lasers hit.</p><p>Players can redeem an "Assault on the Death Star" loading screen and Captain Phasma's "Quicksilver Baton Spear" as a pickaxe as login rewards between June 3 at 9 AM ET and June 10 at 9 AM ET. Fortnite fans can also nab rewards through Twitch; starting May 29, viewers of any streams by creators with the "Galactic Battle" Twitch extension can earn a bundle of five sprays, each representing a different Star Wars faction, to use in-game.</p><p>Additionally, simply linking your Epic and Twitch accounts will yield you a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a> emoticon. Participants of the Twitch event will also get a loading screen if a community goal is met, and according to Epic, those players "might get a jump on what's coming in Death Star Sabotage."</p><p>Despite its relatively short length, this Star Wars mini-season of Fortnite has been quite eventful, introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">controversial Darth Vader AI character</a> and welcoming mobile players back to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">its return to the iOS App Store</a>. It's unknown what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next season of Fortnite</a> will look like, but rumors suggest the battle royale is shifting from a galaxy far, far away to superhero-themed antics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has announced that the tentatively-titled <i>Cyberpunk 2</i>, the upcoming sequel to the hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, has officially entered the pre-production phase.</p>

<p>This news comes via CD Projekt's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial presentation</a>, in which it's also revealed that the company's profits are down when compared to last year, although sales revenue has remained largely the same and gross profit is actually up.</p>

<p>Last year, CD Projekt raked in around $26.6 million in profits, while this year, that figure fell to about $22.9 million, a drop of roughly 14%. It's likely not a figure CD Projekt will be losing sleep over, but it's less than ideal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=dySG16ih 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=vuHvA9Mi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s sequel has officially entered pre-production.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, given that the company hasn't released any major games since&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, it's essentially coasting on back catalog sales and revenue from its GOG.com digital storefront, so a drop isn't necessarily unexpected.</p>

<p>Those back catalog sales are still pretty strong, though, it seems. Back in November, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million mark</a>, with the game managing to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-generated-752-million-in-revenue-as-cd-projekt-shares-update-on-its" rel="nofollow">generate $752 million in revenue</a> for its publisher in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p>

<p>As for the&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>sequel entering pre-production, it could still be a while before we hear anything more about the game, unfortunately. Pre-production is a pretty early stage; it involves prototyping, conceptualizing, and other tasks necessary to get a game ready for full production.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that the sequel is moving ahead is encouraging in and of itself, and given the extensive problems&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>faced at launch, it's probably a good thing if the sequel has a more protracted development process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=TEcX6JM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=tU5KW9uC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CD Projekt's profits may be down, but I doubt the company is panicking.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what else lies in CD Projekt's future, the studio is currently working on&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled in December</a>. The game will star Ciri as its protagonist, although it's probably a few years off yet, so we don't know too much else about its setup.</p>

<p>Not only that, but a full remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow">also in the works</a>, with Polish outfit Fool's Theory (which itself counts several ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>developers among its staff) handling the game's development.</p>
