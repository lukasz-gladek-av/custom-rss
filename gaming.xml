            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment CEO Feargus Urquhart was just featured in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with YouTube channel Limit Break Network. When asked which Xbox IP he'd like to tackle if given the chance, Urquhart singled out Shadowrun.</p>
<p><em>I love Shadowrun. I think it's super cool. Within, like, two months of Obsidian getting acquired I asked for the list. It's just a spreadsheet. I think I got the latest version and I looked through all the stuff. I mean, there's a lot of stuff on there. It's been a while since I looked at it, but it's a pretty incredible thing, and now you add in Activision and all the stuff that they have... But yeah, if you had to pin me down on one, yes, it would be Shadowrun. I bought the book of the first edition when it first came out. I probably own four of the six editions. I think it's a super cool IP.</em></p>
<p>Personally, I agree with the Obsidian CEO. Shadowrun has a lot of potential to flourish and even go mainstream with the right project and budget. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-harebrained-schemes-should-be-microsofts-next-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocated</a> for Microsoft to purchase Harebrained Schemes, which made the latest Shadowrun games, but it looks like they're <a href="https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">busy</a> with something else. Obsidian could be an amazing fit.</p>
<p>Of course, this question followed the more obvious one: would the studio head like to make Fallout New Vegas 2? Urquhart again said yes without giving away anything else.</p>
<p><em>Fallout is very dear to me. I put an incredible amount of my own time into Fallout. I wrote dialogues, I designed maps, and I was a lead designer. That was back at Black Isle. For Obsidian, it was an incredibly important game, not just from the standpoint of how much people love it, but it got us to make a big open-world game, and we learned a lot from it, and so I think it's important to us.&nbsp;Fallout's just fun. I mean, that's why the series also worked well. It's so silly. For me, I would love to make another Fallout game. I always say that, I never back away from it. We'll see. That's the best thing I can say, but if that opportunity comes out, I'd love to do it.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> on Fallout New Vegas 2, and it was rekindled after the show's success and the second season tease of New Vegas. On the other hand, Bethesda seems staunchly against lending their franchise to someone else, so Shadowrun may really be the best option for Obsidian.</p>
<p>Of course, the studio is already busy with its own franchises, such as The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, which is about to get the action RPG spin-off Avowed. On that note, the Obsidian CEO talked about some changes made to the beginning of the game (now <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to February 18, 2025).</p>
<p><em>We made a specific decision about a year ago. Where the game started a year ago is not where it starts. It now basically starts with a prologue. Where we're putting character creation within that and how much we were asking the player to actually do within character creation has been a lot of that. With the prologue, we basically said hey, we need to create a much more directed experience for people to get a taste for a lot of the stuff. Not all the depth that they will be able to do with a character, but give them enough of a taste so they can understand what this game is. It also helped the game introduce players to a taste of what's going on with the conflict and a taste of this part of the world of Eora. In this case, we did make changes specifically because we wanted people to get in quicker and not just hit a wall of too much exposition.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-final-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun.952740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stepping into the 18th <em>Mana </em>game as a newcomer to the series was daunting, but I was enchanted by the characters, combat, and semi-open-world traveling of <em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I was able to preview <em>Visions of Mana</em>. The game is focused on Val, a Soul Guard, and several Alms, who are chosen adventurers dedicated to sacrificing themselves to preserve the flow of mana in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple story setup lets the rest of the game shine. The preview of <em>Visions of Mana</em> only saw a bit of story, mostly creating the backdrop for the characters as a group and a introducing a bit about the politics of the world.</p>
<h2>The Colorful Cast of <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=q_al3RJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=NYwQfs9e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters and the world in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>are stunning.​​​</figcaption></figure><p>The characters are quirky in the best ways possible, and the range of personalities in the five-person group I experienced was delightful. From mellow, happy Hinna to sassy, spirited Careena to somber, serious Morley, the party was well-rounded and kept things interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original characters, Val and Hinna, are cute and happy-go-lucky at the start. However, the stage set during the preview makes it look like they’ll get heavy character development. Some of the other characters grew a bit during the early hours of gameplay, which makes investing in them emotionally a breeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, most of the crew sounded as good as their characters were written. Cutscenes are much more enjoyable when the characters sound good, and for the most part, they did.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;Has Charming Combat</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=iGJAHSA8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=avi2wFaR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies were as well-designed as the characters in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;is well done. It’s not offering fast-paced ARPG fighting but instead takes things a bit slower. Characters move pretty slowly, which felt sluggish at first. However, after the first few fights, it was clear that the slower-paced combat helped focus on playing smarter instead of spamming buttons.</p>
<p>I started with the easiest difficulty option: beginner. However, combat still wasn’t a breeze even at this level. It was challenging even here, which just shows how challenging the game is meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combat is also pretty varied. Each character can change classes with elemental objects. This was fun to mess around with – building teams that played well together while using elemental objects was a challenge since each object could only be with one person at a time.</p>
<p>And, of course, the outfit changes show off just how great the character’s designs in general are.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Frolicking in Fields in <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=GVDunKt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=DNmwax9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can ride this adorable wolf, Pikul, after meeting Morley, and it's one of the cutest parts of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most surprising parts of <em>Visions of Mana</em> was the open-world areas. The game isn’t open world, though some areas are large enough to have multiple fast travel points.</p>
<p>Traveling through these areas was both satisfying and rewarding. There’s a lot to collect, including money. Considering the prices of items in-game, the currency alone makes exploring worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement and banter between characters are part of what makes exploring so fun. Jumping and running is so smooth that it felt like I was constantly racing myself. Plus, a lot of rewards can be obtained just by running over them, adding to this feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The banter between characters is entertaining and kept me laughing while I did this. Combined with great sound design, exploring may have been my favorite part of the preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date"><em>Visions of Mana</em></a> has a lot to love, and while parts of it might take some getting used to, it’s worth it. It’s set to release on August 29, 2024, on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Until Dawn Remake Release Date Set for the Spookiest Month of the Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-release-date-set-for-the-spookiest-month-of-the-year.952737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ballistic Moon have announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake release date, and I'll give you three guesses as to which month this spooky horror adventure is launching in.</p>
<p>That's right: the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's official release date is October 4th. Halloween falls on a Thursday this year, so I suppose launching on that date wouldn't have been an option, but hey - at least the month is right!</p>
<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, which was a PlayStation exclusive, this reimagined version will launch on both PS5 and PC simultaneously, so you'll have your pick of which platform you want to play it on (unless you want to play it on Xbox or Switch, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=3c1FDmXw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=QQE1wk1Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake officially arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the release date, Sony and Ballistic Moon have also released a comparison trailer that shows off some of the changes the two studios have made since the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>
<p>These changes include alterations to some of the game's plot points, as well as a visual overhaul that should make the game look as pretty as you'd expect it to in 2024.</p>
<p>Handily, the trailer includes side-by-side shots to show you exactly what's different, so if you have played the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you should get a kick out of seeing what Ballistic Moon has done with the place, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>comparison trailer right here.</p>

<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is an enhanced remake of the 2015 narrative horror adventure. If you want a rough idea of what Sony and Ballistic Moon are going for with the remake, think&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part I&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully without the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-accknowledges-last-of-us-part-i-issues-on-pc-promises-updates-coming-next">well-documented PC issues</a>).</p>
<p>Although many changes have been made, including visual and narrative differences that you'll definitely notice if you've played the original,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>still has the same basic premise as its predecessor, so you can enjoy this one whether or not you've experienced the 2015 game.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games isn't involved with this remake, although you can still get your horror kicks from that studio thanks to upcoming games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed"><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 4th.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-tarkov-wipe-arrives-august-20-battlestate-reveals.952731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has finally been revealed (after more than 230 days) that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will land on August 20. It’ll go hand-in-hand with the typical Twitch Drops campaign that’ll reward users for watching top Tarkov streamers broadcast gameplay on the purple platform, Battlestate Games has announced.</p>



<p>This marks the end of the longest wipe in Tarkov history and it ushers in the 0.15 patch that’s set to change <strong>plenty </strong>about the most popular extraction shooter game in the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-escape">Prepare To Escape</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has just posted a trailer online for the 0.15 patch that accompanies the first wipe since December 2023:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov Beta - 0.15 Patch trailer (feat. Partisan)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Jlyhs7yOLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In this trailer, we get our first full-fledged look at the Factory expansion, which seems as though it’s blowing the map wide open. As one of the oldest Tarkov maps, Factory has been the place to go for short, aggressive matches for several years, and this change marks the first time it has been expanded by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The trailer for the next Tarkov wipe also reveals new weapons, including the 9mm Uzi SMG and the sought-after Desert Eagle. In one scene, BSG’s capture artists are scene blasting down Killa with the .50 handgun.</p>



<p>Right now, pre-wipe events are unfolding like wildfire in the game, with Battlestate Games tweaking various elements of the game in the final few days of this ‘season’. Before long, everything in the game will be reduced in price to just a few roubles, and players will have the entire game unlocked as they make the most of what’s left of this patch.</p>



<p>Next Tuesday, Escape from Tarkov will wipe, and hundreds of thousands of people will return to the game – then the cycle begins all over again.</p>



<p>Are you planning on playing Tarkov once the 0.15 patch has been deployed?</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, developer Ballistic Moon announced that the anticipated rebuilt version of Until Dawn will launch on October 4, 2024. </p>



<p>Creative director Neil McEwan explained that “our intention has not been to alter the events.” However, they added that the enhanced version will rework the prologue to adjust its pacing.</p>



<p>McEwan also broke down the new build, which adds “updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations.” These improvements will be available in both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. </p>



<p>Ballistic Moon also offered a new comparison trailer, including a few side-by-side glimpses of cinematics and gameplay.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s blog mentioned that the rebuilt Until Dawn will also feature new collectibles, accessibility and usability settings, and the Stay Calm mechanic. Stay Calm is an alternative “for third party peripherals that do not feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.”</p>



<p>The new version just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> a couple of weeks ago. Fans can pre-order the “rebuilt and enhanced” version of Until Dawn starting August 21, 2024, ahead of the October release.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Until Dawn fans can also look forward to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action movie adaptation</a> from Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions. The cast of the film <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expanded</a>, including the return of Peter Stormare, who played Dr. Hill in Supermassive Games’ original Until Dawn.</p>

Remade entirely in Unreal Engine 5, Until Dawn has updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations alongside artistic changes to create a more-atmospheric horror story.</p><p>You can also expect the game to be more gruesome, as the developer says modern pre-rendering simulation techniques have allowed it to create "realistic real-time fluids" and more convincing injuries for the cast.</p><p>The one big change that players can expect is a reworked prologue, as Ballistic Moon has made adjustments to the narrative pacing of the game's opening to give specific characters more screen time. There'll also be new collectibles to discover in the form of Hunger Totems--these add extra context and detail to the world of Until Dawn--and there'll be a range of accessibility settings to tinker with.</p><p>October is shaping up to be the month of horror-game-remake showdowns, as Until Dawn will be launching mere days before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-release-date-revealed-in-new-trailer/1100-6523824/" data-ref-id="1100-6523824">Silent Hill 2 arrives on October 8</a>.

A full list of these interviews can be found </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbgamedev.com/dev-insights">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you can follow my </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cbGameDev">Twitter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to find out when new ones are released!</span></p><p>Some of the Rekindled team at Develop Brighton in the UK  (Left to right: Liam Lambert, Yogi Patel, Rob Moody)</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduce yourself / Rekindled"><span>Introduce yourself / Rekindled</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hey! My names </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmoody11/">Rob Moody</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I’m a ‘hands-on’ lead animator and co-founder at Rekindled Studios! I’ve been in the games industry for almost 15 years now working on a numbers of projects from indie to AAA.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our studio, Rekindled, was established over 2 and a half years ago (wow time flys!) by myself and a technical animator, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smaracle/">Siobhan Maracle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rekindled is an animation and character art house specialising in game project development. We love working co-development contracts and integrating ourselves with different studios, ranging from large AAA studios where we become an extension of their team, to working with small indie studios where we take on the entire character art or animation pipeline for the project!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="What made you want to start your own animation outsourcing studio?"><span>What made you want to start your own animation outsourcing studio?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Myself and Siobhan have worked with each other for 7 or 8 years now in multiple studios across many projects and the last large studio we worked at kind of ran out of internal work so they started hiring us out. We really enjoyed the idea of being mercenary artists, getting to meet lots of new devs, working on different styles, learning new pipelines and tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Siobhan and I worked well as a little unit, Siobhan being a technical animator (the brains) and myself an animator (the creative) were able to collaborate and take on any issue or feature. And after a few years, we thought we could do this on our own and be able to choose cool projects and teams to work with, so we did! And Rekindled was born.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How did you choose who to team up with initially?"><span>How did you choose who to team up with initially?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was myself who first had the idea to set up a studio, but I knew I couldn’t do it on my own. I struggle with admin, I tend to do first, think later and I’m kind of scatter brained, so luckily for me Siobhan didn’t take too much convincing. She has a very logical brain which keeps the company on track. A good analogy is that in Rekindled I have my foot down on the accelerator while Siobhan is pulling up the handbrake, resulting in the studio moving at a nice steady pace!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of splitting up the workload of running the studio, I take on a lot of the introductions and client-side meetings whereas Siobhan likes to run the back end and support the studio. We both get to spend the majority of time doing what we love though, developing and animating. As for the most important skill, I’d have to say that it is communication. We talk everything over in the highs and the lows, being 100% transparent and seeking guidance from another perspective.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="What are the biggest challenges and how do things differ from what you expected?"><span>What are the biggest challenges and how do things differ from what you expected?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the biggest challenges so far have been growing the studios team size and then managing more projects. We started off as a 2 man band and quickly felt the need for an extra pair of hands to cope with demand. Initially, I assumed that bringing on some extra animators to help out would make things easier, and at first it did! We had more skills at hand, more bandwidth and more brains to bounce ideas off. It wasn’t until a couple of months later we realised that we didn’t have a clue how to manage a bigger studio. Keeping employees engaged and tasked up, resulted in working with more studios and more slack servers to track. We were remote only, Discord was our office and we didn’t have regular meetings set up or syncs, everything was kind of adhoc. We were still working it out and as a result, we felt that people felt quite isolated and a little lost. To combat this we now have 2 syncs a day, a short 15-minute discipline sync in the morning and a larger all-studio sync at the end of the day. On top of that, we have two scheduled animation reviews with the team, allowing team members to prepare ahead of time which streamlines the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another challenge as of late has been getting the word out that we also offer character art! </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogipatel3d/">Yogi Patel</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> joined us this year to set up a character art team allowing us to offer the full end-to-end pipeline from character art through rigging to animation. It’s something we have always wanted to have in place at Rekindled. The challenge is that we are currently known as an animation studio but we are hoping that by 2025 we can show that we are more!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Is there anything you would do differently if you started again?"><span>Is there anything you would do differently if you started again?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being honest, I’m not sure I’d do anything differently again. Life is a journey, you learn a lot from mistakes and ventures into the unknown. The biggest unknown for us was the business side, we had animation down to a T, happily working on different exciting ideas and pushing boundaries…. However, we were complete noobs at running a business. Learning what a good contract looks like, NDAs, licences, pensions, accountants, corp tax etc. It was a steep learning curve! But very rewarding.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Any resources you think would help people build their own outsourcing studio?"><span>Any resources you think would help people build their own outsourcing studio?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are many resources that help small businesses navigate their adventures. We’d really recommend using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wearecreative.uk/support/creative-enterprise/">CreativeUKs courses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they run 4 a year, each one aimed at helping studios at different stages of their progression. From foundations for entrepreneurs just starting out, to scaling up a business, then investment-ready businesses. The courses are very affordable, £250 per studio the rest is subsidised by the government and you are in a cohort of like-minded business owners. We completed the scaling up module and as part of the course we met Rebecca from YellowJumper who was assigned as a business mentor for us. This was a fantastic bonus, and worth its weight in gold. I’d highly recommend it to any games industry small business owner.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Where to find more about yourself / Rekindled"><span>Where to find more about yourself / Rekindled</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If anyone wanted to find out more about Rekindled or its services head over to our website: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rekindled.uk/">https://www.rekindled.uk/</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or check us out on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rekindledstudios/">LinkedIn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve also come to learn that networking really is the superpower that everyone in the games industry needs so please feel free to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmoody11/">reach out to me on Linked-in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if you wish to chat!

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer InnerSloth has announced a collaboration with Dungeons and Dragons web series Critical Role.</p>
<p>This collaboration means players can now bedeck their little space beans with a number of items worn by those intrepid members from Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, or Bells Hells. I am talking about Artagan's Incredible Brows Visor or the Dust of Deliciousness Nameplate, to name but two.</p>
<p>"Getting to work alongside the wonderful crew of the hit TTRPG show Critical Role to bring some of their magic to Among Us for Gilmore's Curious Cosmicube has been mind blowing," <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/announcing-among-us-x-critical-role/">InnerSloth</a> said. "Be sure to go to our in-game store and spend some Stars before the Cosmicube is gone."</p>

<p>As for when that Cosmicube will be gone, that will be 12th November at 8am UK time.</p>
<p>Once those Among Us players have purchased the Cosmicube, they can work towards getting these following themed items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artagan's Cloak Skin</li>
<li>Artagan's Hair Hat</li>
<li>Artagan's Incredible Brows Visor</li>
<li>Chetney's Eyebrows Visor</li>
<li>Chetney's Headband Hat</li>
<li>Chetney's Tracksuit Skin</li>
<li>Dust of Deliciousness Nameplate</li>
<li>FCG's Noggin Hat</li>
<li>Fearne's Dress Skin</li>
<li>Fearne's Hair Hat</li>
<li>Jester's Dress Skin</li>
<li>Jester's Horns Hat</li>
<li>Laudna's Dress Skin</li>
<li>Laudna's Hair Skin</li>
<li>Mister Pet</li>
<li>Mollymauk's Garb Skin</li>
<li>Mollymauk's Horns Hat</li>
<li>Moons Over Exandria Nameplate</li>
<li>Nott's Cloak Skin</li>
<li>Nott's Hood Hat</li>
<li>Nott's Mask Visor</li>
<li>Orthax Manifested Hat</li>
<li>Pâté Pet</li>
<li>Scanlan's Hand Hat</li>
<li>Sprinkle is "Fine" Hat</li>
<li>Teatime with Caduceus Nameplate</li>
<li>The Nine Eyes of Lucien Nameplate</li>
<li>Vax's Armour Skin</li>
<li>Vax's Hair Hat</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all these new threads, there is also a new kill animation (which you can see in the header above). To get this animation, players will need to equip all of Chetney's items as an Impostor.</p>

<p>This collaboration with Critical Role comes ahead of cast member <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animated-show-casts-sus-stars-including-ashley-johnson-and-elijah-wood">Ashley Johnson's role as "Purple" in the upcoming Among Us animated series</a>.</p>
<p>We first got word of this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-sci-fi-social-deduction-is-getting-the-animated-adaptation-treatment">Among Us adaptation last year</a>. On its announcement, we were given a general overview that read: "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."</p>
<p>Since then, famous faces such as Elijah Wood, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animation-cast-rounded-out-with-jurassic-park-ratatouille-talent">Wayne Knight</a> and, of course, Johnson have been announced as voicing various crewmembers.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-teases-upcoming-animated-series-with-blood-splattered-pizza-party-image">InnerSloth and CBS Studios shared a small teaser for the animated series</a> with an image showing an empty cafeteria with pizzas and balloons adorned by a banner that read: "We're not dead". Well, actually, it said "We're dead", thanks to an ominous splatter of blood down the middle of the banner.</p>
<p>Hmm, seems sus.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"We had a really hard time at the studio during Covid."</p>

    </div><div>



            
<p>
Satirical space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-announced">announced back in 2021</a>. Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and their ace <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a>, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That's from a new, hour-long interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y">Limit Break Network</a>, in which Urquhart talks about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">this year's Xbox studio closures and layoffs</a>, the trick to retaining talent, the influence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and (as is mandatory for an Obsidian interview nowadays) the pipedream of making sequels for Alpha Protocol and Fallout: New Vegas.
</p>
<p>
"It's going really well," Urquhart said of Outer Worlds 2. "And it's always easy for us to say that, because that's what we should say, when asked the question, but it actually is. I'm really impressed with the team." While Avowed remains the priority, of course, Obsidian have apparently built "a pretty good wall  - not a wall, it's a semi-porous membrane" between that project and Outer Worlds 2 in terms of managing creative input and resources. I am inevitably picturing a web of mucus dividing the office, with Spacer's Choice branding on one side and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-really-pushed-avowed-as-a-co-op-rpg-pivoted-to-single-player-in-eight-months">mushroom bears</a> on the other.

"Luckily, the lead programmer is the same lead programmer, Leonard Boyarsky is the same creative director, Brandon Adler's game director, Matt Singh was a tester on Fallout: New Vegas, and he's the head of gameplay and content," Urquhart added. "So we were very lucky that we have a lot of people on that game that get it, that worked on the first one and worked with us for a very long time."

<p>
Nonetheless, it sounds like it was touch and go for Outer Worlds 2 during the pandemic lockdowns. "We had a really hard time at the studio during Covid," Urquhart said. "We got acquired [in 2018], and we were figuring out how to be acquired, and then Covid happens, and we're trying to get Outer Worlds done, and we're trying to get the DLC done, and we're trying to move Avowed forward, and we want to start again on Outer Worlds 2, get Outer Worlds 2 moving, and Grounded moving, and Josh [Sawyer] is working on Pentiment... 
</p>
<p>
"There's just all this stuff happening, and to be honest, we were kind of a crappy developer for about a year and a half," he went on. "There was talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'. There was talk of 'well, should you do that?', because Grounded wasn't in Early Access yet during some of these conversations." (The implication here, I think, is that Obsidian also thought about reassigning Outer Worlds 2 personnel to Grounded.)
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Obsidian decided to stay the course, while embracing the prospect of delays (Avowed was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-release-delayed-into-2025-to-dodge-a-busy-season-on-game-pass-claims-report">pushed back to 2025</a>, albeit seemingly to avoid a "busy period" on Microsoft's Game Pass service). "We kind of said: no, we will get there," Urquhart recalled. "We will get there with all these games. Are they going to be on the timelines that we originally thought? No. But we're going to get there and I think that's been proven now. 
</p>
<p>
"Grounded turned out awesome. Pentiment turned out awesome. Avowed is going to be great. Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. And then we have a base now, of everything we've now done with Avowed and Outer Worlds 2, with how we use Unreal Engine and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years, to go off and make the whole next generation of games."
</p>
<p>
It's worth considering these thoughts alongside Urquhart's comments earlier in the interview about the dark art of juggling several projects. Amongst other things, he highlights the importance of "working with" third-party tools such as Unreal Engine rather than trying to create too much bespoke technology.
</p>
<p>
I wasn't that keen on the first Outer Worlds: I found its chortling satirical elements self-indulgent, and its RPG design too familiar. But I share Alice Bee's (RPS in peace) view that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-pc-review">"it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks"</a>. Hopefully, Outer Worlds 2 will bring it home. As for Avowed, I'm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-combat-wasnt-ready-to-show-at-reveal-obsidian-admit-but-theyve-made-it-feel-more-juicy-since">mixed on what I've seen of that too</a>, but I've been thinking lately that it's been a while since I last fireballed a mushroom bear. Fingers crossed it sticks the landing as well.

        <p>Plus, new 'Trending Free' tab introduced.</p>

            <p>Valve is making some changes to written store page descriptions on Steam.</p>
<p>Starting in "early" September, the Steam team (the dream team's lesser known cousin) will be "enforcing new rules for what can and cannot be included in your written store page descriptions".</p>
<p>These changes are coming into force due to a recent "trend", as Valve describes it, that has seen a number of developers using their store page descriptions as a platform to "present information or links" to other places.</p>
<figure>

<p>It specifically said that developers had been using descriptions as a way of advertising other store pages on Steam, in some cases with as many as eight other games mentioned within the text before it got to the game the page is actually about. Valve said this can be distracting.</p>
<p>These changes to the current Steam rules will affect four specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "About The Game" section</li>
<li>the "Short Description" section</li>
<li>Any "Special Announcement" sections</li>
<li>The "Awards" section</li>
</ul>
<p>There will still be a section with dedicated link fields on store pages, for the likes of Discord, Facebook, X, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, YouTube and a developer's own website. Valve said developers can also highlight other games they make by <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/bundles">creating bundles</a> of related games, setting up a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/franchise_pages">franchise page</a> or by setting up a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage">developer/publisher page</a> with all the games made by the same entity.</p>
<p>Valve also wanted to help reduce confusion around games with a 'prologue' label. "We've seen developers doing novel things on Steam to help build an audience through a separate app that most call a 'prologue'. In these examples, developers are buying a secondary appID and releasing it as a stand-alone free game to promote the upcoming release of their full premium game," it explained. "This has been fine with us, but we've seen a few ways that it causes confusion for players and unnecessarily requires devs to pay a second app fee."</p>
<p>Valve continued: "With a few changes to how demos work, we can replicate the positive benefits of a separate 'prologue' while also creating a tighter connection between the two entities so that customers are clear on how to learn more about the full game and to wishlist the correct thing.</p>
<p>"The changes already made to demos should make it unnecessary for developers to purchase a separate appID to use for prologues, and can instead use the demo appID that is already associated with their game."</p> <div>

<p>In another change, Steam now has a separate 'Trending Free' tab, as you can see in our screenshot below.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1823565448656642433">GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless</a>, this change has been made in response to "complaints of 'free demos are stomping on paid games in the New &amp; Trending charts'".</p>

            <p>Valve have made no secret of their plans to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steamos">SteamOS</a> – the Linux-based operating system that powers the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">recent beta update</a> mentioned adding support for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">Asus ROG Ally</a>’s inputs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">The Verge</a> confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS", Valve engineer Lawrence Yang told The Verge. "The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS".</p>
<p>While Yang also warns that this third-party support "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet", it’s likely a comforting development for those who crave the Deck-beating performance of its big rivals – the ROG Ally, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> and so on – but don’t fancy their preference for Windows 11. Which is understandable, as unpleasantness abounds when trying to wrestle a desktop-optimised operating system with a tiny touchscreen and thumbsticks. The ability to run more of your PC games collection without SteamOS’s occasional compatibility trip-ups is a compelling one, though even the most basic Steam Deck can work around this, be it through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">streaming games from the cloud</a> or manually installing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">non-Steam launchers</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there also exists a contingent of Steam Deck owners/admirers who’d like to dual boot their handheld with both SteamOS and Windows. Best of both worlds, innit. Unfortunately, this feature sounds even further off than the spread of SteamOS, despite being floated as a possibility back when the Deck first launched. So sayeth Yang:</p>
<p>"As for Windows, we’re preparing to make the remaining Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED available (you might have seen that we are prepping firmware for the Bluetooth driver). There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support – it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet."</p>
<p>Booo. You can already bodge a form of dual-booting, by installing Windows on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> and booting from that, though being able to keep both on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s SSD</a> will first require an indeterminate amount of thumb-twiddling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/14/crkd-nitro-deck-plus-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One of our favourite gaming accessories of last year, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/crkd-nitro-deck-review/">CRKD Nitro Deck</a>, was able to legitimately turn the Nintendo Switch into a more comfortable handheld console by aping the form factor of the Steam Deck and Wii U Gamepad. It’s fair to say that technology can move at an alarming rate in gaming, and so is the case here, with the arrival of an updated Nitro Deck+ which builds on the original’s excellent form, while adding in the features that fans were crying out for. The result? An excellent device, but one which swaps improvements in some places for downgrades in others.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nitro Deck+ Announcement Trailer • CRKD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iInNpwJdcak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nitro Deck+ feels like a more serious device than the original, even if it’s fundamentally answering the same design brief. This is an all encompassing grip, which your Nintendo Switch device slides happily into, swapping out the thin and often flimsy feeling Switch and Joy-Con combo for something far more robust and comfortable.</p>


<p>Our Nitro Deck+ was mainly built from smoked black plastic – a clear white version is also available – with black buttons and hardware, and a flash of metallic purple beneath each analogue stick. Compared to the purple Nitro Deck we originally tested, it’s more grown-up and less obvious, though I do miss the GameCube colour scheme.</p>
<p>Just as with the original, the Nitro Deck+ feels rock solid, and though it’s quite light when taken on its own, once you’ve added the Nintendo Switch itself, it comes in at 598g, which feels relatively close to the Steam Deck’s 640g. I’ve never had a problem with the additional heft, but it might be something worth considering for younger gamers.</p>


<p>The most obvious change in this new iteration is the positioning of the right analogue stick, with CRKD shifting it from its original offset position to a symmetrical design. While I never found the Nitro Deck’s stick positioning to be a problem, apparently everyone else did, and with the shift there are definitely some improvements to be found, particularly if you play FPS games. I spend a lot of time on Overwatch 2 – a <em>lot</em> – and it felt much more at home on the Nitro Deck+, but the changes to the stick have had some annoying consequences.</p>
<p>Moving the right stick meant that the face buttons had to go somewhere, and their positioning directly beneath the stick feels unnatural. You have to move the palm of your hand out to comfortably access the B button, and given that you’re probably using that one the most (depending on the game) it can be a problem. Now, if you’ve got small hands it feels as though there’s going to be less of an issue, but if you’re an adult human being, these are potentially major changes.</p>
<p>The annoying thing is, CRKD have listened to all the feedback for the original, and really piled the improvements in. The most exciting one is that the Nitro+ now functions as a dock, meaning you can immediately hook your Switch up to the TV while travelling. The caveat is that you will still have to carry a USB-C to HDMI adaptor around with you, and a pretty lengthy HDMI cable unless you bring another controller, but it answers one of the loudest requests from the community. It’s a welcome change, especially if you travel a lot, but it won’t replace the ease of using Nintendo’s dock at home.</p>

<p>While the face buttons have moved in a way that isn’t an improvement, there are now two additional face buttons to the left and right of the device, nestling next to each stick. As with the back buttons, you can program these on the fly, and move whatever main input to them you choose. If you’re willing to put in the time, they’re a quick and appreciably easy extra pair of buttons to manage. They make a lovely tactile click too.</p>
<p>The chunky back buttons make the face buttons’ woes easier to deal with, assuming that you’re the kind of person who likes a back button. All four of them here are chunky, responsive and easy to reach, and if you’re playing competitively they mean you can basically forget about the face buttons.</p>
<p>I loved the CRKD Nitro Deck, and the changes to the Deck+ have answered some of the community’s most requested feedback. However, while the right stick is arguably in a far more comfortable place, and one which promotes its ease of use and accuracy, the face buttons, particularly the B button at the bottom of the device, are not as comfortable to use.</p>

<p>Once you’ve added in the ability to use the Deck+ as a dock, and the additional buttons, I’d say that it’s a fractionally improved device. Having spent a number of weeks with it, it hasn’t left my Switch, and for the games I’m playing the face buttons haven’t caused an issue. You need to consider though if that’s going to be the case for you. If you can live without the dock functionality, you might still be better off seeking out one of the originals.</p>

<p>According to the latest claims, a full version of Minecraft for PlayStation 5 might be released soon. As per PlayStation Game Size on X (formerly Twitter), a new PS5 ID has been added to the Minecraft database, hinting at the imminent release of the full version. However, an official announcement is yet to arrive.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-arrives-on-playstation-5-with-preview-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview version</a> of Minecraft on PS5 currently runs through the PS4 version. The developers are working on a native version of the PlayStation 5 to optimize the game’s performance on the console’s hardware. The preview version was rolled out for a limited time, so developers could use the feedback and work on any reported bugs to make the experience smoother once the full version arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the preview version of Minecraft on the PS5, players can try out content from the Tricky Trials Update and Realms. Also, users of the preview version cannot access the Minecraft Store and can only play multiplayer with other PlayStation players. Cross-play is only available through Realms.</p>



<p>In other news, Minecraft received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-receives-a-tetris-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetris DLC</a> recently, allowing players to experience the classic game with a unique twist that transforms a round of 2D Tetris into a thrilling 3D dungeon.

"We've seen developers doing novel things on Steam to help build an audience though a separate app that most call a 'prologue'. In these examples, developers are buying a secondary appID and releasing it as a stand-alone free game to promote the upcoming release of their full premium game," adds the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This has been fine with us, but we've seen a few ways that it causes confusion for players and unnecessarily requires devs to pay a second app fee.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-mod-adds-real-elevators-with-no-loading-screen.952647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-adds-real-elevators-with-no-loading-screen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Starfield mod succeeds where the base game couldn't, adding real elevators with no loading screen to Bethesda's sci-fi roleplaying game. Modder EdgiestSwing23 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10904?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> it this week on Nexus Mods, though it should be clarified that the mod only covers some of the elevators found in Starfield.</p>
<p><em>Replaced a total of 18 elevators at 15 locations, making them truly movable elevators without the need for loading. </em><em>The elevator is induction type, which means that when you approach the elevator door, the elevator will automatically come to your floor and open the door without you having to press a button. </em><em>However, the elevator buttons are still retained to prevent accidents. </em><em>The locations of these elevators are:</em></p>
<p><em>Starlight Lounge</em><br>
<em>Two elevators outside Neon City</em><br>
<em>Two elevators at Star Key Station</em><br>
<em>New Home Tower Elevator</em><br>
<em>Rl039world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>Upper and Lower Elevators in the New Asia Business District</em><br>
<em>Jieneng Dai Group</em><br>
<em>Embassy of New Yawalu</em><br>
<em>UCVigilance</em><br>
<em>Main elevator of Earth colonization spacecraft</em><br>
<em>Earth Colony Spaceship Security Room Elevator</em><br>
<em>Earth Colony Spaceship Classroom - Cafeteria Elevator</em><br>
<em>DR011world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>RL036world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>RL010World (unknown location, untested)</em></p>
<p>The author shared his method of creating fully working elevators. As such, others might add more of them to this Starfield mod, which could eventually lead to covering the entire game.</p>
<p>The Starfield modding scene continues to flourish following the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of mod tools in early June. The game itself is also about to be improved with the addition of land vehicles (a leaked video <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> recently on Twitter) and the upcoming Shattered Space story expansion. Moreover, Bethesda recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a 'Starborn' trademark. This could hint at the title of a second expansion, given that Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> a while ago of annual expansions coming to the RPG for a while, in what would be the strongest post-launch support for a Bethesda single player game yet.</p>

            <p>It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ep9bq9/let_the_bots_advance_let_the_super_earth_burn">Multiplayer</a> shooty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.</p>
<p>“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ep9bq9/let_the_bots_advance_let_the_super_earth_burn">post titled</a> “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/frustrated-with-the-nerfs-helldivers-2-grunts-are-protesting-by-letting-the-bots-take-super-earth-and-theyre-dangerously-close-to-succeeding/">via Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.</p>

<p>“In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction,” <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game">reads the post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/08/arrowhead-unveils-60-day-plan-to-placate-rebellious-helldivers-2-fans">PushSquare</a>. “ All of that is on us and we are going to own that.  As many of you have pointed out, and we agree, what matters most now is action. Not talk.”</p>
<p>Said action, promises Arrowhead, will take the form of the following bullet-pointed agenda. Is there a gag about the bullets not even being able to make points any more due to nerfs? Probably. That’d be stupid though, so I’m just going to lampshade that I think it’s stupid while still basically making the very same gag. In the biz, this is known as "having your cake and gagging on it". Here’s Arrowhead’s plan over the next 60 days:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Continue to re-examine our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance.</li>
<li>Update how the fire damage mechanic works to tweak how the flamethrower serves as a close range support weapon. (A quick straight revert won’t work, as it would break other things)</li>
<li>Rework gameplay to prevent excessive ragdolling</li>
<li>Re-think our design approach to primary weapons and create a plan for making combat more engaging</li>
<li>Re-prioritize bug fixes so that the more immediate  gameplay-impacting bugs are prioritized.</li>
<li>Improve game performance (frame rate is a focus)</li>
<li>Rework Chargers</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, from a bigger picture perspective we will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority.</li>
<li>Post regular player surveys to gather more insights and feedback from the community.</li>
<li>Improve our process for patch/release notes - providing more context and reasoning behind changes.</li>
<li>More blog posts and streams where we expand on these topics for those interested.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The flamethrower item seems to be the sticking point for the community here - it’s where a lot of the hubbub is centred, particularly since it’s now far less effective against Chargers. I can see the issue here. Chargers are rapidly able to throw a game into chaos if not dealt with quickly, especially in big numbers on higher difficulty levels. It’s also understandable that both the community and Arrowhead themselves would be feeling a bit of fatigue over balancing woes. Back in May, former CEO-turned-creative-director Johan Pilestedt said he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-balancing-has-been-removing-the-fun-arrowhead-ceo-frets-just-tweaking-damage-numbers-is-a-blunt-tool">thought Arrowhead has “gone too far” in some areas</a>. "Will talk to the team about the approach to balance. It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed." Helldivers 2 can be a glorious time, so I do hope it manages to reach an equilibrium everyone’s happy with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lovely-free-lovecraftian-first-person-parkourer-grimhook-to-become-a-complete-game">Grimhook</a>.</p>
<p>Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139620/Frontline_Crisis/">a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis</a>. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.</p><!--more-->
<p>The addition of the tab follows <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">a series of changes</a> to how demos work on Steam in July. You might have noticed that you can now add them to your library without immediately installing them, and that you can install them even if you own the full game ("primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos," say Valve). </p>
<p>Developers can now give demos their own store pages, though adding a demo button to the full game's store page is still an option. This means that players can leave user reviews for them, as with full free or free-to-play games. Valve have also made changes to the Steam homepage so that demos appear in the New &amp; Trending and New on Steam charts, together with tag and category pages. Going by forum chatter, this latter move has created a logjam of demos and free-to-play games in amongst the full-priced releases, which may be why popular free games now have their own tab.</p>
<p>Given that these are free games, of course, it's likely the tab will have a quality control problem, with grifty experiences such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">that Banana game </a>hogging the feed. Still, it's a convenient addition for people who have not yet learned the <a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/21491/?min_reviews=500">mighty ways of SteamDB</a>. Or bookmarked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/free-games">free games page</a>.</p>
<p>In more businessy news, Valve have also announced that they're <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836">cracking down on links to other websites on Steam store pages</a>. As Brendy observed when he handed me this particular news gobbet, Valve seem irked that lots of game pages basically exist to redirect to and promote other games by the same developer or publisher. With one hand they giveth, etc.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-airdrops-bosses/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has added another cryptic image to social media showcasing the next Tarkov pre-wipe event. It’s another typical showing, revealing that airdrops will become much more common while the game’s bosses are being pulled together onto the same map. </p>



<p>This is nothing we’ve not seen before, which is another stab of disappointment for fans holding out for something unique. We’ve already seen the Flea Market locked down, high-value loot spawns increased, skill levelling boosted, and Hideout upgrades accelerated, but nothing ‘fresh’ has appeared as we approach the 0.15 patch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dive-in">Dive In</h2>



<p>These are events that have surfaced in Escape from Tarkov before.</p>



<p>First, airdrops will become so common that they’ll seem non-stop, with planes flying over every map and dropping stacks of high-end loot for players to fight over. Then, all bosses will appear on the same map at the same time. This is something we’ve seen before in Tarkov, and the last time it happened, the bosses all loaded in on Customs at the same time.</p>



<p>It creates a nightmare scenario for players wanting to take it a little easier, but it’s pre-wipe, so they’ll just need to deal with it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these events don’t apply to PvE-exclusive players. As PvE doesn’t follow a traditional ‘wipe’ pattern, it isn’t susceptible to these events. Therefore, it’s business as usual for anyone <strong>not </strong>playing PvP or ‘typical’ Tarkov.</p>



<p>Presently, we’re not sure which map the bosses are spawning on – we’re working to confirm that now.</p>



<p>Are you enjoying the pre-wipe schedule leading up to patch 0.15 being deployed?</p>

<p>Riot Games has just revealed a new cosmetics pack coming to Valorant called the Wonderstallion bundle, and fans have been quick to point out that it’s something ripped clean from Fortnite. It’s a gaudy, unicorn-themed set bursting at the seams with bright colours and rainbow effects, and it’s splitting the community down the centre.</p>



<p>Many are impressed with how cute and attractive the Wonderstallion skins are, while others are ranting that it’s an aesthetic best left to the likes of Fortnite. It’s deeply reminiscent of Fortnite’s iconic Llama in some respects.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-valorant-wonderstallion-bundle-coming-out">When Is The Valorant Wonderstallion Bundle Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Riot Games showcased the new Wonderstallion bundle on social media but neglected to provide a release date. However, the expectation is that the bundle will arrive with the 9.03 update that’s being rolled out <strong>now</strong>. If not, it’ll likely be released within the next week or two.</p>



<p>For now, Riot Games has simply labelled it as ‘available soon’.</p>



<p>Here’s a clip of the Wonderstallion bundle in action:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the image, it looks like we’ll be getting a Wonderstallion skin for the Vandal, Guardian, Spectre, Frenzy, and of course, a Melee variant. It looks like it’ll also come with a Buddy as part of the bundle.</p>



<p>It has been estimated that the bundle will cost around 3,400 Valorant Points, but each weapon should be made available individually for around 850 Points. </p>



<p>Are you going to invest in the Wonderstallion bundle in Valorant?</p>

<p>It has been claimed that Valorant is getting a sorely needed update in the anti-toxicity stakes. For the longest time, Valorant has been a minefield for gamers worldwide, and the in-match communications systems are typically flooded with insults, derogatory comments, and abuse.</p>



<p>Now, in the latest bid to tackle that toxicity, Riot Games is reportedly preparing to roll out a ‘Black List’ feature in the game. This claim comes mere months after Riot Games overhauled Valorant’s guidelines in an effort to push more toxic players off of the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-black-list-in-valorant">What Is The ‘Black List’ in Valorant?</h2>



<p>Per the claims on social media from <a href="https://x.com/ValorantUpdated/status/1823462571078230241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valorant Updates</a>, the team at Riot is preparing to roll out the ‘Black List’ feature, which is a fancy name for a blocking mechanic. It seems bizarre that this doesn’t already exist, but we’ll chalk it up to it having been an oversight by Riot Games for the last four years.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that the Black List in Valorant would allow players to block and restrict other users, preventing them from messaging them, speaking to them in any way, or from sending them friend requests through the platform.</p>



<p>It’s good, but many players were quick to point out that a better feature would be an ‘Avoid Player’ mechanic. When you add a player to that list, you’ll never be matched with them again, essentially. </p>



<p>That’s a much more effective way to avoid malicious players, but perhaps that’s the next step for Riot Games.</p>



<p>Have you ever come up against toxic players in Valorant? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/replaced-pushed-back-to-2025-to-%E2%80%98meet-high-standards%E2%80%99.952620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has just been revealed that REPLACED, the upcoming ‘retro-futuristic cinematic platformer’, has been delayed and pushed back to 2025. The last we saw of REPLACED was at Summer Games Fest, and despite the lengthy delay, the team at Sad Cat Studios has confirmed that it’ll still be playable at Gamescom.</p>



<p>This Xbox- and PC-exclusive 2.5D platformer looks solid on the surface, offering up a unique story that’s somewhat similar to Cyberpunk 2077 at first blush. It’s far from being the first time the game has been delayed, though. The announce trailer stated it would be released in 2022, but that was then updated to 2023, then 2024, and now, it has been pushed into 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-but-sideways">Cyberpunk But Sideways</h2>



<p>In the announcement trailer that was dropped more than three years ago, players are introduced to the world of REPLACED. It offers up a slick and high-intensity take on the 2.5D platformer paradigm, boasting immense lighting, fantastic depth-of-field mechanics, and smooth, fluid animations.</p>



<p>The core story of REPLACED unfolds in a dystopian, almost post-apocalyptic setting, with players assuming control of an AI trapped in the body of a human against its will. That’s where the Cyberpunk 2077 vibe starts to surface. The story unravels in ‘Phoenix City’, which has been twisted and torn by an ever-degrading societal standard.</p>



<p>Here’s the first trailer for REPLACED:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED | Announce Trailer | Coming 2022" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_P5OlfGbk5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks really good, even if it’s not the type of game I’d typically play. I’ll pick it up for the aesthetic and the fluidity of the thing. It’s just a shame that it has now been delayed <strong>again</strong>. In <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103">a st</a><a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a</a><a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103">tement</a>, the team said, ‘We need more time to meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves and to meet the expectations of our fans.’</p>



<p>Are you excited about REPLACED eventually being released?</p>

<p>XDefiant continues to develop since being released by Ubisoft on May 21. Today, the 1.4 patch rolls out, with the notes recognising that it’s mostly targeting a few bug fixes and tweaking out some glitches. Ubisoft is also adding some new cosmetics bundles and implementing a minor range of quality-of-life improvements, so it’s not all that key an update.</p>



<p>As these patches are deployed, it’s no big secret that with each passing one, the XDefiant player count is dwindling. On social and streaming platforms, the sentiment around the first-person shooter is growing stale and people are simply losing interest in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-xdefiant-s-1-4-patch">What’s In XDefiant’s 1.4 Patch?</h2>



<p>It’s a simple assortment of things in the latest patch to hit the XDefiant platform.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has addressed a series of bugs impacting challenge progress, in-game stats, and a certain glitch in Zone Control that would almost automatically award the attacking team the win in a few seconds. In the patch notes, the team addressed this particular bug as ‘weird’.</p>



<p>The bulkiest part of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/5rzufG2wP1rEr3jriHRkrb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the patch notes</a> is around weapons, with Ubisoft having tweaked the M44, the TAC-50, and the L115, increasing their overall spread and making the game’s assortment of sniper rifles less overpowered. To put it simply, it now means that players will need to be ‘fully scoped in’ to reliably land kills with a sniper rifle. </p>



<p>The team also addressed issues with ‘magnet’ sticky grenades and tweaked some issues with the in-game reporting system.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but with the player count dropping with each passing day, fewer people are around to soak up the benefits of these changes. When it was released, XDefiant soared, but the buzz quickly dropped off, and within a matter of weeks, the free-to-play first-person shooter had all but passed out of relevance.</p>



<p>If we use the <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/780302568">numbers from Twitch</a> as a representative example, we can see that the all-time high peak viewer count of 203,000 has dwindled this month to just 8,000 – and it continues to decrease. </p>



<p>It’s part and parcel of a new release and we can expect that, but this game will only survive with a healthy player base, and that presents a huge concern.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, that’s not a typo. </p>



<p>I’ve recently jumped into the alpha for Delta Force: Hawk Ops, and to give the game credit, I’ve been having a <strong>blast</strong>. For an alpha, it’s remarkably well-built, and the team at TiMi Studio has gone so far as to introduce some live service elements even though this is just a testing period.</p>



<p>However, I can’t get away from the fact that it feels like I’m playing Battlefield 2042. From the maps and modes to UI and the ‘specialist’ characters, and from the land, sea, and air combat model to the core mechanics, <strong>everything</strong> feels like a Battlefield game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-unique-enough">Not Unique Enough</h2>



<p>I’ll be frank – Delta Force: Hawk Ops has <strong>serious </strong>potential. I’ve had more fun playing this than most other shooters that have emerged in the last few years. It looks fantastic, it runs well, and everything from the weapons to the characters feels solid and well thought out. It would be great if it didn’t look like a re-skinned Battlefield 2042, though.</p>



<p>Those familiar with EA’s most recent Battlefield game will look at some of these screenshots and believe it’s 2042’s menu:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It gets a little bizarre – even the choice of font, the colour palette, and the iconography look like Battlefield 2042’s aesthetic. One of the main game modes sees attacking teams attempt to capture objectives while defending teams try to hold them back, which is a mirror copy of Battlefield’s fan-favourite ‘Breakthrough’ mode.</p>



<p>TiMi Studio has tried to implement some innovative and unique features in Delta Force: Hawk Ops and there’s a campaign section on the way that’ll allow players to walk through the events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, so it’s not a like-for-like replication – but it’s damn close.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-worth-playing">Is Delta Force Worth Playing?</h2>



<p>Like I said, I’m having a great time playing Delta Force: Hawk Ops, and I’m particularly enjoying the extraction shooter mode that feels like a trip down memory lane into DMZ, Call of Duty’s failed extraction shooter mode. It’s essentially the same thing, introducing an ‘easier’ and more ‘arcade’ extraction shooter experience that’ll sit well with more casual gamers.</p>



<p>In Delta Force, the gunplay feels satisfying, weapon customisation is slick, and the line-up of specialists is diverse enough that they each stand apart from one another. I’m a particular fan of Luna, an agile character who wields a bow capable of firing ‘recon arrows’ or electrified shots. </p>



<p>It feels good, it looks good, and it’s free to play. It’ll inevitably be bolstered by a slew of microtransactions, season passes, and cosmetics bundles, but that’s the way of the world. In the absence of a new Battlefield game and the death of Call of Duty’s DMZ, Delta Force: Hawk Ops could be just what the gaming world needs, even if it is a mirror image of those very games. </p>

                <p>The massive world of Warhammer 40,000 has seen a whole lot of adaptations into video games, covering genres from third- and first-person shooters to turn-based strategy. For the latter, Fanatical has the massive <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bundle-warhammer-40-000-battles&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffill-out-your-warhammer-40k-library-on-pc-with-this-monster-fanatical-bundle%2F1100-6525775%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Battles: Warhammer 40,000 Battles bundle</a>. It's full of PC games and DLC, giving you plenty of opportunities to wage war with games you can snag for as little as $2.50 each. You can get the entire bundle of games and DLC packs, 18 in total, for $45.</p><p>The centerpieces of the bundle are <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</strong>; <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach</strong>; <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon</strong>; and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</strong>. Each is a massive turn-based strategy game, made even bigger by a ton of DLC--you can get seven different add-ons for Gladius, three for Sanctus Reach, and four for Battlesector. The bundle also includes the DLC Pack for Armageddon, which includes its five add-ons in one package.</p><p>Like other Fanatical bundles, the Build Your Own Battles bundle is mix-and-match, meaning you can pick up as much or as little Warhammer 40k as you like. The more you add to your bundle, however, the lower the individual price for each game. You can snag three games or DLC add-ons for $3.33 each ($10 total), five games for $3 each ($15 total) or eight or more games and DLC for $2.50 each. There's no upper limit on how many games you can add to your bundle, and once you've picked more than eight, the price is $2.50 each for the lot.</p><p>Fanatical also has a deal on the next major Warhammer game, third-person shooter <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffill-out-your-warhammer-40k-library-on-pc-with-this-monster-fanatical-bundle%2F1100-6525775%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which is due out on September 9 on PC--or September 5, if you preorder one of the pricier editions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3958162/valve-steam-box-cake">once imagined</a> that every PC maker could have their own "Steam Machine," a PC game console running the company's Linux-based SteamOS. It took a decade for that dream to evolve into the company's own internally developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> gaming handheld, but the original dream isn't dead. </p><p>The company's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#">long said</a> it plans to let other companies use SteamOS, too — and that means explicitly supporting the rival Asus ROG Ally gaming handheld, Valve designer Lawrence Yang now confirms to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A few days ago, some spotted an intriguing line <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">in Valve's latest SteamOS release notes</a>: “Added support for extra ROG Ally keys.” We didn't know Valve was supporting any ROG Ally keys at all, let alone extras! </p><p>Maybe Valve was just supporting those keys in the Steam desktop client on a Windows, where it offers a Steam Deck-like Big Picture Mode interface for any PC, and the line mistakenly made it into these patch notes? I asked to be safe.</p><p>But no: this is indeed about Valve eventually supporting the ROG Ally and other rival handhelds! </p><p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS," Yang tells me. </p><p>That doesn't mean Asus will officially bless Valve's installer or sell the Ally with SteamOS, of course. (Asus has told me there are many reasons why it ships with Windows; a big one is that Microsoft has dedicated validation teams that ensure its operating system works across many different hardware configurations and chips.) </p><p>And it's not like Valve is suggesting it'll offer SteamOS for rival handhelds anytime soon, either. Valve is “making steady progress,” Yang tells me, but it “isn’t ready to run out of the box yet.”</p><p>We already knew Valve plans a general release of SteamOS 3 that you can theoretically install on non-handheld PCs as well; Yang says it's similarly making progress there but it's not ready quite yet. </p><p>So that's the update on turning Windows handhelds into Steam Machines; what about Valve's promise to let you turn Steam Decks into dual-booting Windows machines too, letting you swap between the two OS at will? Here's Yang on that:</p><div><blockquote><p>As for Windows, we’re preparing to make the remaining Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED available (you might have seen that we are prepping firmware for the Bluetooth driver). There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support—it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet. </p></blockquote></div><p>Valve isn't the only one adapting its compelling combination of Linux and controller-friendly Steam UI to Windows handhelds. Universal Blue touted that its Bazzite operating system had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/">already achieved support for the Asus ROG Ally X</a> before it even came out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The deal drops the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine: The Board Game to $32 (was $40), and is eligible for free shipping. To get the lower price, you will need to make a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fl%252Ftarget-circle%252F-%252FN-pzno9&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free Target Circle account</a> and sign in before adding the game to your cart.

One player controls the Space Marine Lieutenant Titus of the Ultramarines Chapter, and the other commands an army of Tyranids in asymmetric matches that last around 30 minutes. The box includes a grid-based playmat, rulebook, dice, ruler, one Lieutenant Titus miniature, and 22 Tyranids. Each miniature comes unassembled and unpainted just like in standard Warhammer 40,000 tabletop sets, giving new players a taste of what it's like to build and customize their own army. The minis are also compatible with the standard Warhammer 40K tabletop game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine: The Board Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349721,1300-4349722,1300-4349723,1300-4349724" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While this deal is an excellent chance to grab Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and dip into the world of Warhammer tabletop, several other board games are also eligible for the 20% Target Circle discount, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fstar-wars-villainous-board-game%2F-%2FA-85017096&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-villainous-introduction-to-evil-board-game-disney-100-edition%2F-%2FA-87884715&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Favalon-hill-betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-3rd-edition-game%2F-%2FA-85008832&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Betrayal At House On The Hill</a>, and more.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> came out over a decade ago, exploring underground was already spooky, but it was pretty monotonous; lava and the rare diamond block were the most exciting things to see. Nowadays, though, heading underground is a much more exciting experience. Caves are far more varied and interesting, and there are even deep-buried Ancient Cities to loot--if you can avoid the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens of biome types and subtypes aboveground, but below ground you'll find fewer biomes and more danger.</p><p><strong>Note: This guide focuses on the Bedrock version of Minecraft, available on Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and mobile.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Dripstone Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Dripstone caves are, as the name suggests, full of dripstone stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites crawling up from the floor. Dripstone is useful for a variety of applications, like a self-replicating lava farm, and can be used as spikes to damage players and mobs. Copper spawns in comparatively large amounts in dripstone caves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lush Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Lush caves are a stunning addition to Minecraft's subterranean world. For a long time, Minecraft caves all kind of looked the same--stone for ages, with little patches of desirable blocks like iron ore and diamonds scattered about. Lush caves, however, are packed with plant life. They're covered by moss blocks, moss carpet, azalea bushes, grass, and flowers on the ground. From above, you can find glowberries--both a fruit <em>and</em> a source of light--along with vines and spore blossoms. Shallow ponds generate with dripleaf plants and, sometimes, axlotls.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Deep Dark</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782" data-ratio="0.52552083333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deep Dark caves are where things get scary. These dark caves generate mostly in the layers where stone turns to deepslate. You'll find sculk sensors and shriekers, which can summon wardens. The Deep Dark is also where Ancient Cities spawn, and are a source of enchanted golden apples and a rare music disc, among other treasures. No mobs aside from wardens spawn here, but wardens can kill you nearly instantly even when you're fully armored in Netherite, so take care when exploring this biome.</p>
