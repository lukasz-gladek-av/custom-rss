<figure data-uuid="50933ec4874e0"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/50933ec4874e0/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even just a handful of months after its launch, the Switch 2 is proving to be a particularly compelling console for third-party developers. One of the biggest surprises was the announcement that not only would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launch on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>, but it would be followed by both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Rebirth</a> and the currently untitled third entry in the Remake Trilogy.</p>
<p>To find out more about the process in bringing the games to the Switch 2, we recently spent some time with series director Naoki Hamaguchi. We talk over how he got into game development, how Remake was optimised for Nintendo's new console, and how the team was influenced by a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p>We also had another go with the Remake demo on Switch 2, all in handheld mode, and it's not hyperbole to call this is thing astonishing. The visuals are near indistinguishable from the PS5 version, and although frame rate is capped at 30fps, it felt much smoother and stable than the official figures would have you believe. Provided the full game is up to scratch, this is almost certainly a 'miracle port', and it's comfortably the best-looking game on Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's dive into our conversation with Hamaguchi-san...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Ollie Reynolds): Am I right in thinking you were inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a> to get into game development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> Yes that's absolutely right. I think I was in secondary school, so I was still fairly young back then. But even as a child, I remember seeing that: the ensemble cast with their own stories to tell, the setting, the emotional and dramatic storytelling. It was amazing, and it's not a movie, but a piece of digital entertainment I could become involved with.</p>
<p>It was very vague at that point, there was nothing specific in my head, but I thought it would be great if I would get involved in this kind of thing when I'm older. So yes, it was definitely from Final Fantasy VI.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8c606c650ca2"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8c606c650ca2/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So how does it feel to go from being a fan of Final Fantasy to now leading the development on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was inspired by Final Fantasy when I was a kid, it made me want to go into games at some point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was inspired by Final Fantasy when I was a kid, it made me want to go into games at some point. Then I joined Square Enix some time after university and I've been working here for over 20 years now – maybe 24, 25 years, I'd say – working on Final Fantasy that whole time, slowly growing and learning more about it.</p>
<p>In some ways, I've been brought up by Final Fantasy and I've learned so much about it over the years. So the feeling that I have now is very much the idea that I want to give back to the series that has really taught me so much and given me so much. So that's where my mind and my heart are at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>How much pressure do you feel to ensure that the trilogy lives up to fans' expectations? And as a fan yourself, do you have your own personal expectations that you'd like to meet?</strong></p>
<p>My honest feeling is that yes, there is pressure, I can't deny that, but I don't really let it get on top of me. It's just so satisfying and rewarding to have so many people out there waiting for your game. Having so many people play and enjoy these games is really special, so I'm having a lot of fun with it at the same time.</p>
<p>One other thing is that the team we have working on this series is just really, really great. I'm blessed to have it, and it really supports me in making these games. It contains a lot of new people, people like myself who were fans of the original games, but then we also have a number of creators who worked on the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>. So people like Tetsuya Nomura, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Kazushige Nojima...</p>
<p>Having them there really helps to ground it in the original and keep that essence of what made Final Fantasy VII what it was. In some sense, if it was just me and I was responsible for everything, then it might wind up becoming my personal take on it as a fan. But together, we're able to determine what is most important for the fans and create a modern piece of entertainment that still retains the core essence.</p>
<p><strong>With that in mind, how confident are you that the upcoming third game will deliver a satisfying conclusion?</strong></p>
<p>Well obviously, there's no way I can tell you today how this ends what happens in the conclusion of the trilogy. But the game itself is coming along really well, the story is all fixed down and final now, and we've moved onto working on the core gameplay experiences; I know exactly how that's going to be structured to be really satisfying and delight the fans.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to the day when that can be brought to the players, and I am very confident that it will be a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.<strong><br></strong></p>

<p><strong>I've played the demo for Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2, and it's remarkable just how good it looks and how well it runs – particularly in handheld mode. Can you talk about the development process for this and what challenges you faced?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, thank you! That's the best praise you could give me for that. I am confident at the moment, with all the games available on Switch 2, in terms of the most high-end graphical experience, I think we are the best – we really hit the peak on that game.</p>
<p>I love the Switch 2, I think it's a great piece of hardware, it's got impressive specifications, and it can do a lot. From a developer's perspective, there's a little kink in it where when you go from TV mode to handheld mode, there are obvious concerns about battery life, conservation, etc. And of course, the technical capacity of the system actually drops when you go into handheld mode. That can be a difficult thing for developers to get around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in terms of the most high-end graphical experience, I think we are the best</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when we started development, we ported the previous version to Switch 2 to see how it was running. As we'd expected, the frame rates in handheld mode were perhaps a little below where we wanted them. So we had to do some optimisation to ensure the frame rate was where it needed to be and the visuals were what fans were expecting, and I think we got a really good result from how we approached it.</p>
<p>It's very character-based, we've got lots of really iconic main characters like Cloud, Sephiroth, etc. And the way that they appeared as characters had to be right, they couldn't be in any way inferior to how they will have appeared on the other platforms.</p>

<p>Most of this was in the lighting, and how the light affects their faces and expressions. We decided that even though lighting is quite a high-processing burden and would put a lot of pressure on frame rate, it had to basically stay the same.</p>
<p>So once we had that baseline down, we could look at things we could adjust, so things like shadows and the post-processing effect. A lot of this was down to our engineering team, and if you compare the games side-by-side, even in portable mode, they look really close. Some small effects you might be able to notice things have changed, but having the lighting remain the same was important to have the most impact on the players' experience of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a personal preference between TV mode and handheld mode?</strong></p>
<p>I personally prefer the portable mode, that's the one I'd most like people to try out and experience.</p>
<p>However, we really wanted as little difference as possible between TV mode and portable mode, so when you have TV mode, you have native 2K with a very stable resolution and frame rate. When it goes down into handheld, it can't be maintained in the same way, so it does drop the resolution, but we've used DLSS to upscale it and get it as close as possible.</p>
<p>So even comparing side-by-side, you can see that the quality is very much the same. That's why I want people to really pay attention to what we've done with the handheld mode.</p>

<p><strong>The original Final Fantasy VII is also available on the Switch. Would you recommend newcomers try this out first before moving onto Remake, or would you prefer the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>In a lot of ways, that's a difficult question to answer. A lot of people say to me that if they could go back and play the original Final Fantasy VII with no knowledge of the story and enjoy it for the first time, there'd be nothing better than that. The Remake is designed to be enjoyed by people who have played the original and know it well, and also by complete newcomers who know nothing about it.</p>
<p>So either way is fine, you'll enjoy the game and have a similar experience whether you've played the original or not. If you have the opportunity, I'd like you to play the Remake first and enjoy it as a fresh experience on its own.</p>
<p>There are definitely nods in there, so if you've played [the original] before, you can see how we've reworked things, and that's a completely legitimate way of playing. But if you've not played it before, I'd kind of like you to experience the Remake first with the new graphics and presentation and have that be your first impression of the game.</p>
<p><strong>And like the Switch port of Final Fantasy VII, the remake has also introduced Streamlined Progression, which includes options for maximum health, damage, etc. What was the thinking behind this? And did you get any pushback from your colleagues for adding it?</strong></p>
<p>So there's two main points as to why we wanted to include these. The first one – and this kind of links into the fact that we wanted to announce that the whole trilogy would be coming to the Switch 2 – is that these are very large RPGs and we want people to play through the whole trilogy and experience everything. However, the time commitment is quite strong and that might put some people off. So to lower the barrier for entry is really the idea behind that. People can get through the games quicker and prepare themselves to play the later games in the series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always find myself wanting these kinds of functions when I play games</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The second point is very much a personal thing for me. As a game creator, I spend a lot of time making games, and so I find that I have very little time to play games outside of that. And I imagine there are a lot of people in similar situations. I think it's a shame.</p>
<p>I would really like to spend more time and see more of the game I'm playing, but if a powerful enemy shows up, I don't want to be spending all the time getting stronger just to beat that one guy. If only there was a way to put my level up to maximum and then see more of the game. So I always find myself wanting these kinds of functions when I play games.</p>

<p>In terms of whether there was any pushback or negative response to that within the team, I don't remember there being any. It might be the fact that I'm the director and it's difficult to say these things to me, but I don't remember there being anyone particularly worried.</p>
<p>Of course, after we announced it, there were people on social media concerned about whether it would affect playing the game properly. It's important to stress that it's an option. It's important to provide choices that fit into what players are looking for today, and one of the parallels is the idea in streaming services like Netflix of the double-speed playback mode. When that was introduced, everybody thought it was terrible, but people have started to get used to it and accept it now as an option. But of course we're not going to base the game balance on having those features available and therefore forcing you to use them. If you want to use it, you can.</p>
<p><strong>As a Nintendo-focused site, one of the big RPG franchises for us is Xenoblade Chronicles. I'm curious if you'd played the Monolith-developed games and if these have influenced your approach to the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy?</strong></p>
<p>I remember I was involved with the <strong>Xeno</strong> games we made in the past with Square Enix, but unfortunately I haven't played the more recent ones from Nintendo, so I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p>But if you talk about other Nintendo games that have influenced me and I've taken a lot from – and you might think this is a bit of a cop out – then it'll be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. It's such an inspirational game and I've learned so much from that. Looking at how its affected the Remake series, moving from Remake to Rebirth and that switch to more open-world gameplay, Breath of the Wild was hugely influential there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...telling a story around gameplay first, seeing how Zelda achieved this was definitely an inspiration for Rebirth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you compare the kinds of games we make in Final Fantasy with Zelda, in some ways the approach is slightly different. Our games very much start with the story, and then we kind of work out what kind of gameplay experience we want to add to create that story and that feeling of being in that story.</p>
<p>I think Zelda does it the other way around, they start with the gameplay experience and then the setting and world is kind of fitted around that. So telling a story around gameplay first, seeing how Zelda achieved this was definitely an inspiration for Rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>When you're done with the third entry in the trilogy, will you be taking a much-deserved break? Or do you have other projects that you're working on?</strong></p>
<p>In my position, I am the director for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, so my biggest focus at the moment is getting part three done and seeing fans reactions to that. In addition, I'm also the head of Creative Studio One, so that's involved in making other games which I'm a part of.</p>
<p>One big thing I'm looking forward to in the future is having the team I've put together work on something new. One thing that's common in the industry is that when a project is finished, the team is split and moved around, but that hasn't happened here. We've basically got the same guys all the way from the beginning of the project right through to the end. So I'm really looking forward to the game that we look to create after – it could be a Final Fantasy, it could be something completely different... I've not decided yet.</p>
<p>But whatever it is, gamers who have paid attention and seen what we've done with the Remake trilogy, they'll have great expectations and will look forward to seeing what the team come up with.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c794968f3977"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c794968f3977/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there any other Final Fantasy games in the series that you'd like to see get remade?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of if the company thinks it's a good idea and there's a business opportunity there to do one of the older Final Fantasy games and remake it in a similar way, there's a lot of them we haven't done, so I definitely think we could.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn't want it to be me that does it. The Final Fantasy VII series has taken up well over 10 years of my career as a creator, and it's been great, I've really enjoyed working on it. But if I was asked by the company to helm another Final Fantasy for another 10 years, that would probably be my career over by the time it's done, so I would rather work on something completely new. I think the fans would probably appreciate something new too, maybe.</p>
<p>If there's another younger creator within the company, someone who's really passionate about Final Fantasy and wants to do a remake project, then I'd definitely back them up as much as I could; I just don't want it to be me!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I just want to personally thank you for the work that you've done. Fans have been dreaming for a remake of Final Fantasy VII for years, and I think the results so far really speak for themselves. I can't wait to play Remake, Rebirth, and the third game on the Switch 2.</strong></p>
<p>I'm so happy that there are people out there with that passion for the game, and myself, I'm very much in the same boat. The love and affection I have for Final Fantasy is very much there, I really do love the games. I made a joke about it, how I've been working on this for 10 years and would like to try something different, and that's funny, but the experience has just been amazing to work on this game for so long and really put everything I have as a creator into it. It really is the culmination of my whole career so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The love and affection I have for Final Fantasy is very much there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the third game out there is very important and making sure it's as good as it needs to be. I have a vision in my head of what the final version is going to look like, and I think it'll be a really satisfying experience.</p>
<p>But obviously, before then, people who haven't played Final Fantasy VII Remake yet, this is such a good opportunity to do so now that it's coming out on the Switch 2. The whole series is coming to the Switch 2, so if you want to play it, have a go with the first one, you won't regret it, and then we can all play the third game together and it enjoy it together in real time.</p>

              <p>Being and adult can be a lot. We’re expected to work at least eight hours a day — usually more. For some of us it might take over and hour to commute to work, each way. When we finally get home, we have dinners to cook and dirty clothes to launder. To stay healthy, we should be getting in some daily exercised too. Plus, some of us have small humans to take care of, pick up from school, help with their homework — it’s never ending. If you fall behind on vacuuming your living room, that’s completely understandable with everything else going on. Though, you work so hard, you deserve to come home to a clean home every day. That’s why you got to jump on this Amazon limited time deal for a Eufy robot vacuum.</p>
<p>The Eufy C10 can be scheduled to clean up for you every day while you’re out so you can come home to a clean living space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/">The robot vac is currently 54% off, saving your more than half. It normally is listed at $480, but the discount brings it down to just $220.</a> That’s a savings of $260 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Self-Empty Station</h2>
<p>Not only does this vacuum clean your floors for you. It can also empty itself all by itself. The docking station it returns to after every trip has a three-liter dust bag which the robot vacuum empties into each day. So instead of needing to empty the robot vacuum every few days, you only need to empty the dust bag about every 60 days.</p>
<p>This robot vacuum has a powerful suction with 4,000 Pa of sucking power. The rolling brush makes it so the vac can pick up all kinds of tough debris like pet hair, dirt, and crumbs embedded deep in your carpet.</p>



<p>The vacuum is designed to be a short 2.85 inches tall. This slim shape allows it to navigate under tight, hard-to-reach spaces like beneath a couch, bed, or desk.</p>
<p>Navigating your home comes easy to this robot vacuum. The Eufy C10 uses laser navigation to map out the layout of your home, analyzing and creating an optimal path to take for a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>You can used the companion app to mark off any no-go zones you don’t want it to enter. The app also can be used for scheduling when you want the robot vacuum to run. You even use voice controls to get it started on the fly.</p>

              <p>Have you ever gone duck hunting? It’s terrifying. Somehow those birds are always watching, ready, hiding just out of plain sight ready to get you. Mmm. On second thought I might have that experience confused with something else. Regardless, murderous animals are funny and horrifying, and it seems a lot of folks on Steam are in agreement as duck-based indie shooter <i>Escape From Duckov</i> has just pulled ahead of EA’s big AAA shooter <i>Battlefield</i> <i>6</i> in concurrent players.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">There’s A Damned Good Reason <i>Escape From Duckov</i> Has Sold A Million Copies In A Week</a></p> <p>Released on October 16, 2025, <i>Escape From Duckov</i> is a solo survival extraction shooter featuring ducks with guns who aren’t afraid to use them. It has that lovely charm that many indie games tend to get when they fuse an otherwise serious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">well-executed</a> genre with a not-so-serious premise: in this case, ducks with guns.

<p>After receiving feedback on the Deluxe Pack: ex special booster pack, Pokémon TCG Pocket developers are working on a new Card Dex Registration update for next year. </p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket recently celebrated its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary</a>, and with that, we got some decent improvements, including a new share feature, an upgrade to trading, and a Wonder Pick Buff. Now, the developers are updating how the card players collect are registered in the Card Dex. </p>



<h2 id="h-cards-that-appear-in-multiple-booster-packs-will-be-registered-in-the-tcg-pocket-card-dex-for-all-corresponding-packs">Cards that Appear in Multiple Booster Packs Will be Registered in the TCG Pocket Card Dex for All Corresponding Packs</h2>



<p>According to a recent post on Pokémon TCG Pocket’s official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1981707338969956720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Card Dex Registration update will be released after summer 2026, and many players aren’t happy about the developers taking so long to implement this change. The new “changes are intended to provide players with a more enjoyable card collecting experience.” Check out how Pokémon TCG Pocket Card Dex will change in 2026 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, whenever a player procures a card that appears in multiple booster packs, that card will be registered in the card dex for all corresponding booster backs. Which means if you receive a Mewtwo ex from a Genetic Apex booster pack, the card dex will register it for both Genetic Apex and Deluxe Pack: ex. </li>



<li>Secondly, the cards that players have already obtained, which include any cards collected from the Deluxe Pack, will automatically be registered in every applicable card dex retroactively. </li>



<li>Lastly, these changes, along with related UI improvements, will arrive after summer 2026. </li>
</ul>

It will launch “as soon as possible,” with the team aiming for a December release. It will be a free upgrade for existing owners of <em>Factorio</em> on Switch. The <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [584 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of the expansion downloadable content “Space Age” will launch at the same time. <span id="more-1002419"></span></p><p><em>Factorio</em> is currently available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/factorio" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.factorio.com/buy" target="_blank">direct download</a>, as well as for Switch.</p><p>Here is an overview of the <em><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [22,975 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Switch 2 Edition</em>, via Wube Software:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em></strong></p><p>Similar to other games, we decided to release a <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, an upgrade you can get if you own the game for the original Switch. If you don’t have the game you can get it as part of a”bundle” which is the game with the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> upgrade. Nintendo has some more information / clarification about <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions</em> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The upgraded version will feature:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen’s native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</li><li>Variable refresh rate support for the console’s screen.</li><li>Some higher quality animations.</li><li>Some higher resolution <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</li><li>Other visual improvements.</li><li>Faster loading times.</li><li>Ability to build much larger bases.</li><li>Mouse mode support. Using the Joy-Con Mouse Sensor, the left or right Joy-Con can be used as a mouse.</li></ul><p>The price for this upgrade will be… free. We don’t believe paying for a technical upgrade is reasonable. For players who want to support us, and want more content, they can get the “Space Age” expansion.</p><p><strong>Expansion Downloadable Content “Space Age”</strong></p><p>We are happy to announce that “Space Age” will be coming soon to the Switch 2, as a downloadable content priced at $35. It will feature the same content as the PC version—nothing was removed or trimmed down.</p><p>For full details on the “Space Age” expansion, check out the <a href="https://factorio.com/space-age/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Space Age” content page</a>.</p><p><strong>Release Date</strong></p><p>Both the <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> and the “Space Age” downloadable content for Switch 2 will release at the same time. The release date is… as soon as possible.</p><p>Like with the release for the original Nintendo Switch, the certification and store setup can take a long time. I don’t want to delay the release by setting a conservative release date, but I also don’t want to promise a release date that we might miss.</p><p>We are aiming for a December release, so you can get a nice gift before Christmas. Not an official release date, just something we are aiming for.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first footage of <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> below, showcasing the game’s mouse mode.</p><h2><span>Switch 2 Mouse Mode Gameplay</span></h2><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-1002419-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4">https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4</a></video></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/factorio-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Brainrot Goes To Court]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brainrot-goes-to-court.1334017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The maker of one of <em>Roblox</em>'s top games is taking brainrot to court. Developer Spyder Games filed a complaint in a California court on Thursday, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has been reviewed by Aftermath</a>, over what it calls a copy of its record-breaking <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>.</p><p><em>Steal A Brainrot </em>is consistently within the top three games on <em>Roblox</em>. It's a simple game: You collect and steal brainrots from other players. It's kind of like capture the flag, but instead of one or two flags, there's a lot. And they're also not flags—they're brainrots. Brainrots in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> are based off Italian brainrot, which is a bunch of weird, absurd memes, like a shark wearing three Nike sneakers. (He's Tralalero Tralala.) Or it's a cappuccino mug that's got a ballerina body. (Ballerina Cappuccina.) The brainrots in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> are based off these memes. By stealing brainrots, you earn currency to upgrade your base and thus defend your brainrots.</p><p>Attorney Adam Starr is tasked with explaining all this to the court. He describes it in the complaint as "a treasure hunt in a world filled with unique 'brainrots,' which are based on silly internet meme characters."&nbsp;</p><p>"The brainrots march slowly in a line down a red carpet that runs through the center of the arena of game play," Starr writes. "Players capture the brainrots and take them to their base, which is like a mini jail on the edges of the arena, to earn virtual currency. Different brainrots have differing values, depending upon their rarity. Meanwhile, players can steal each other’s brainrots from their respective bases. The virtual currency a player earns from the brainrots can be used to upgrade their bases or unlock special abilities (like grabbing brainrots or escaping thieves more easily)."</p><p>It's absurd, and that's kind of the point. <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> is exceptionally popular. In October, it had <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/robloxs-steal-a-brainrot-becomes-first-game-to-surpass-25m-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25.4 million people</a> logged into the game at one time, surpassing both <em>Grow A Garden</em>, another supremely popular <em>Roblox </em>game, and <em>Fortnite</em>'s peak of <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/563750-most-concurrently-played-videogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15.3 million</a> concurrent players.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Steal A Brainrot</em>’s playerbase goes up when there's an update, but typically decreases, though not enough to take it out of the top three <em>Roblox </em>games. There are more than 619,000 players in the game at the time of writing. The game often goes viral on TikTok and other platforms because its chaos is good content—<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@neney_10203040/video/7529432713707801887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like kids crying over brainrot</a>. All this is to say that <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> is really popular, which makes it really lucrative for developers earning money by selling items and through <a href="https://create.roblox.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblox</em>'s creator rewards program</a>.</p><p>The developers <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/siebel_PA002544969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> copyrighted</a>, as of August. There are a lot of <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> copycats or offshoot games on <em>Roblox</em>, but one on <em>Fortnite</em>'s user-created platform, an alleged copycat, stands to earn a lot of money: <em>Steal The Brainrot</em>. <em>Steal The Brainrot</em>, which is at issue in the complaint, has more than 33,000 active players at the time of writing, <a href="https://x.com/FeRinS_FN/status/1977478743892324365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but has reached peaks of more than 531,000 concurrent players</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the series’ earliest 2D entries, to Ryu's critically acclaimed foray into 3D, Ninja Gaiden has hacked and slashed its way to the top of the hyper-violent action games genre. And while countless ninja games have been released since the 1988 NES original, Ninja Gaiden still remains relevant nearly 40 years later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why is that? Let’s take a look back to when this series found its core game design DNA, with its early use of cinematics, narrative-driven gameplay, and innovation in difficult but rewarding challenges (not to mention, one of the sickest finishers ever in a video game.) From there, we’ll chart the course of Ninja Gaiden to see how it has kept its blade sharp over the decades, and why it remains one of the most influential action series of all time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Defining The Great Line</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1988. Arcades are a dominant force thanks to the likes of Double Dragon, Ghouls &amp; Ghosts, and Contra. These are all excellent games in their own right, but little did the world know that one of the most important ninja games of all time was about to be released. Ninja Ryūkenden, the game we in the western world now know as Ninja Gaiden (because, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100819051328/https://hg101.kontek.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden9.htm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the game’s art director</a>, “it sounded cool,”) launched with two dramatically different versions. The arcades saw a Double Dragon-inspired port, which while popular at the time, was dramatically different from the NES console version of Ninja Gaiden we would all come to know and love. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden was an unexpected revolution in action games. Overnight, it redefined what video games were capable of thanks to its difficult but gratifying combat, narrative-driven gameplay, and one of gaming’s first uses of cinematic cutscenes to tell its story. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-1760963315218.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original Ninja Gaiden box art. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, you’d be hard-pressed to find a major release without some sort of cutscene or narrative break, with some even feeling more like interactive movies than video games. In the early days, though, this simply wasn't the case. The majority of games on the NES used a single static image with text and music to bookend a game's story, something you could only very loosely call a cutscene. Games like Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda, which featured stories that demanded more explanation, would require you to open up the manual and find it yourself, rather than find it in the game. And yes, while hardware was a limitation, that wasn’t the only reason. Western and Japanese versions of some NES games varied dramatically in narrative,  tone, and marketing. Such variations were due to the fact that, at the time, video games were still considered to be primarily for kids, which each territory’s version tweaked for their respective younger audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Ninja Gaiden’s goals was to change that. Developer Tecmo used a Hollywood blockbuster-like approach to elevate its storytelling for mature audiences. The game starts with a <a href="https://youtu.be/ueeKMQSS4bw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene of two ninjas</a> duelling to the death in a grassy moonlit field. Like a “big budget” movie, it utilized fast cuts, cinematic camera work, a widescreen aspect ratio, and expressive music to set up the death of Ryu’s father, the inciting incident that leads you on a game-long quest for revenge. Revenge narratives weren't new to video games, but that kind of cinematic setup sure was. In just a few seconds, we went from video games with little to no storytelling, to anime-inspired cutscenes and dialogue motivating you to complete your journey. This level of storytelling marked a major step forward in the perception of video games, proving they could be so much more than a child’s toy. Now, video games could also be an engaging platform to tell a captivating story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cutscenes, however, aren't the only thing that made Ninja Gaiden stand out all those years ago. Tecmo’s game design also made significant strides, and Ninja Gaiden proved to be uniquely challenging to gamers of the 8-bit generation. Instead of having to time jumps and memorize level layouts like in early Mega Man and Mario games, Gaiden’s high difficulty, high reward gameplay tied progression to skill development and a player’s ability to master the game’s combat mechanics.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-stage11-1760963708535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden had a fresh approach to difficulty, with enemies that would surprise attack from behind.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Ninja Gaiden, most “hard” games were purposefully designed to be challenging because it was an easy way to pad out the run time (or, in the case of the arcade, make sure our pockets were noticeably lighter when we left.) While some games, like early Mega Man, Castlevania, and Mario games, did demand a level of skill to beat, their difficulty was mostly based on level memorization. Ninja Gaiden was one of the first games to take the idea of high-challenge, high-reward and mould it into something enjoyable. You’re going to die a lot, but after enough frustrating failure (those dogs at the start of the game are no joke, and don't even get me started on the flying enemies in later stages) you’ll quickly find yourself playing with a mix of defensive dodging and aggressive strikes, and having a lot of fun while you do them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stage 1-1 is a masterclass in this philosophy, teaching players that challenge can be rewarding. The first stage in most games typically acts as a tutorial. Super Mario Bros. teaches players how to jump with little difficulty. Metroid forces the player to backtrack in order to gain the morphball ability, teaching players the necessity of exploration. And Sonic quickly demonstrates the need for speed. By immediately thrusting you into combat, Ninja Gaiden’s first level not only explains the game's core mechanic of kill or be killed, but also demonstrates that enemies can come from all directions, even behind you. The game's tutorial level is a trial by fire that teaches you to strike first and strike fast. That skill is continually reinforced throughout the game, requiring a lot more trial and error as things get progressively harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds familiar, doesn't it? While the first true “soulslike” game wouldn't be released for another 20+ years, it's not hard to see Gaiden's DNA in Demon’s Souls, Bloodborne, and every other soulsborne game since. This challenging and, at times, frustrating game design not only solidified Ninja Gaiden’s NES adventure as one of the 8-bit era’s best games, but also helped shape the next generation of Ryu’s adventures on the Game Boy, SEGA’s Master System, and, a decade later, the original Xbox.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bury Me in Black</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninja-gaiden-black-1760964153805.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Team Ninja's 2004 3D re-imagining of Ninja Gaiden was an action game revolution.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth generation of video games featured some of the most influential games of all time. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Resident Evil 4. Halo: Combat Evolved. Kingdom Hearts. Metal Gear Solid 3. The list goes on and on. So, it would take a forward-thinking (not to mention generation-defining) entry in the Ninja Gaiden series to cut its own place in what many consider one of gaming’s best generations. For Ninja Gaiden, no fewer than three games kept the series sharp during a time where the competition was fierce and groundbreaking innovation was everywhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years earlier, Tecmo had established a new internal studio to develop Dead or Alive. But by the turn of the millenium, that studio – now named Team Ninja – had begun work on a new Ninja Gaiden. That project would become 2004’s Ninja Gaiden, released exclusively on Microsoft’s new Xbox console. Its expanded 2005 release, Ninja Gaiden Black, is considered one of the greatest action games of not only the sixth generation, but of all time. IGN gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/19/ninja-gaiden-black">incredibly high score of 9.4</a>, praising its fast-paced combat, its hard but rewarding gameplay, and action. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original, this new take on the series had the goal of redefining the standards of what an action game could be. While the cutscenes looked great for the time, it’s Ninja Gaiden’s gameplay that would once again shine and raise the bar for challenging action games across the board, while still emphasizing the strike hard, strike fast precision and timing from the NES era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is more chaotic and aggressive now that Ryu can be attacked in three dimensions, and parrying incoming attacks relies heavily on timing and rhythm. You can't just button mash your way through enemies – it requires a more methodical approach with each encounter, something you hone through a lot of death. Just like in the first game, you're taught this right off the bat as you find yourself fighting two very annoying ninjas on a cliffside. Rhythm, timing, and enemy behavior are important here. Foes can attack you from all sides and quickly overwhelm Ryu. Choosing when to attack, when to dodge, and when to avoid enemies ends up becoming a meta game of rock, paper, scissors, and it’s something we’ve seen in countless games since – from the Batman Arkham series to practically every Souls game ever. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ng2b-1760964258281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden 2 was re-released in 2025 with remastered visuals and extra content.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For some players, myself included, Ninja Gaiden Black was one of the first games where, even though the gameplay could get extremely frustrating at times, it was pretty hard to put down once the game's core mechanics were figured out. For me, it wasn't until I beat the first boss, timing my strikes and dodges by finding the right balance between patience and aggression, that I understood how rewarding Ninja Gaiden could be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time the final boss comes stomping around, I’d been trained to fight in such a way that the entire event feels cinematic based on its gameplay, not cutscenes. Instead of cheesing the boss and spamming the attack button a million times until their health bar hits zero (which is how I unsuccessfully played at the start of the game,) I found myself dodging and parrying in ways I simply couldn't early on in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a journey that's found in pretty much every high-difficulty, high-reward game to this day. But if you take a step back and think about it, by forcing the player to “get good”, or at least achieve some semblance of a flow state, the combat actually becomes a narrative device that helps progress the story. By combining parries, dodges, and attacks with razor precision, you grow alongside Ryu. You get stronger alongside Ryu. And, most importantly, by the end, you fight like a master Ninja. It’s just like what the first game achieved, way back in 1988. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Never Fade Away</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as impactful as the 2004 release, Ninja Gaiden 2 and 3 went on to receive critical acclaim and multiple re-releases and revisions. These games improved on what made the original Xbox release so meaningful, pushing Gaiden’s precise combat and difficulty into the next console generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the franchise didn't cut through the competition in quite the same way Ninja Gaiden Black did at the height of the sixth console generation. And so it wasn't until well over a decade later that indie developer The Game Kitchen would revitalize the series with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. What’s old is new again. Ragebound took the series back to its 2D roots, adding more to the lore of Ninja Gaiden, and perfecting the series’s difficult-but-fair gameplay for a new generation of side-scrollers. It went on to be considered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">one of the best</a> entries in the series, according to the IGN audience, and I concur. What’s more, it helped pave the way for the latest instalment, Ninja Gaiden 4, which looks set to raise the bar again for a new generation of hyper-violent and tough action games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impossible to overstate the impact Ninja Gaiden has had on action games over the years. Its DNA can be found in hundreds of great games – echoes of its excellent combat mechanics, crushing difficulty, and use of cinematics can be found everywhere in the genre. Simply put, action games as they are today simply wouldn’t exist without the influence of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ninja-gaidens-razer-sharp-gameplay-still-influences-games-today]]></content:encoded>

In the end, P.T. revealed itself to be a "Playable Trailer" for the secret project Silent Hills, which never came to fruition. For many — myself included — it's considered one of the scariest video game experiences of all time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/gettyimages-2203703262-1761310261566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima's P.T. lives on in a Japanese classroom.

According to the blog update, it created an exciting atmosphere in which students — around the age of U.S. sophomores — could familiarize themselves with English while taking a trip through one of the most terrifying games ever released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, the students were particularly alarmed when the phone started ringing but were encouraged to talk about through "natural English expressions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/silent-hills-has-been-officially-cancelled"><u>Konami officially cancelled Silent Hills in 2015</u></a> after a painfully public fallout with Kojima.

The subtitle appears to differentiate Kojima's video game from the OD project being worked on by filmmaker Jordan Peele. "There is a different kind of fear Jordan [Peele] will do. Mine is the 'knock,' is the fear," Kojima said. "I really am afraid of big knock sounds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amy E.

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO of Take-Two, has once again shared his thoughts on AI in the video game space, and he believes the technology is "great" but people are overstating what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/ai-is-a-combination-of-metadata-with-a-parlor-trick-take-two-boss-says-a-great-thing-for-business-but-its-not-creative-and-never-will-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a> that Zelnick said at the Paley International Council Summit this week that, "AI is a great thing" for "every industry," including video games. But it's not a magic wand.</p><p>"Will it recreate or create genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of compute with a language model attached," he said.</p><p>The executive added that AI will probably be able to help people work more efficiently, but AI is not a forward-looking technology that can actually do anything creative.</p><p>"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model," Zelnick said. "And by definition, a data set is what? Backward-looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward-looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what? A predictive model."</p><p>What's more, Zelnick pushed back on the claim that AI will lead to net losses in jobs, citing historical evidence to make his point. "In 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture. Today we make food for America and food for the rest of the world. And 2% of the workforce is involved with agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible, I can't get a job as a farmer,'" he said.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said the term "artificial intelligence" is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">oxymoron</a> because machines cannot learn. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>Zelnick also previously talked about how people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.7, which brings a "highly anticipated" playable character, a brand new permanent game mode, and more early next month.</p>

<p>As announced in a press release, Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", launches on November 5th across all platforms. As you'd probably expect, the update's story follows on from that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-3-6-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 3.6</a>&nbsp;and "marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga".</p>

<p>You'll explore the Ruins of Time, where a huge sword marks the place in which Phainon used his power to seal away the dread Irontomb. Naturally, Irontomb is stirring once more, and it'll be up to you and your team to put him down again.</p>

Just by having her in your team, your party's damage will be increased.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Cyrene can deploy a Zone on the battlefield that deals an additional instance of damage to any enemy within it that's struck by an ally. Her Ultimate uses stacks of the Remembrance resource to activate her teammates' Ultimate abilities and to buff teammates further.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new gameplay mode in the form of Currency Wars, which sees players forming teams of up to ten fighters in order to take part in combat operations. 61 characters will be available as part of this mode, and you'll be able to try them all out as part of a free trial as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", will launch on November 5th across all of these platforms. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-nearly-at-6m-for-opening-week.1333954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced first-week sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and the game is outpacing past titles like&nbsp;<em>X&amp;Y&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Let's Go: Pikachu</em>, although it can't quite hold a candle to the series' heaviest hitters.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1981553421472706640" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wario64</a>),&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>has sold 5.8 million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">launching on October 16th</a>, and almost half of those sales were on Switch 2, so that's a pretty even split platform-wise.</p>

<p>As noted by sales analyst <a href="https://x.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pierre485</a>, this figure makes&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>the fifth fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game in the series. It's lagging behind titles like <i>Scarlet and Violet</i>,&nbsp;<em>Sword and Shield</em>, and its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Legends: Arceus</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=gHvRBstT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=xbURqT-Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit six million.</figcaption></figure><p>It's noteworthy that the five fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games are now all on Switch hardware. No doubt Nintendo will take this as an encouraging sign when it comes to the upcoming tenth generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, details of which were apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" rel="nofollow">leaked earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in what is now the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, which shifts its gameplay away from the traditional series emphasis on catching 'em all in favor of a more narrative and research-led approach.</p>

<p>This time around, you're exploring the city of Lumiose in order to assist the Quasartico corporation with an urban redevelopment project, all while attempting to raise your trainer rank to the coveted A in the titular Z-A Royale event.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of game lies in store for you should you decide to check it out, right here.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the original <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-121292/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/805679/dispatch-review-steam-ps5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-offers-a-rare-unique-twist-on-superhero-stories.1333951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We are saturated with superhero media to the point where even self-criticism has been done to death with franchises like <em>Watchmen</em> and <em>The Boys</em>. But with its debut choice-driven narrative adventure, AdHoc Studio has managed to find a unique angle for the superhero genre.</p><p>In <em>Dispatch</em>, the story focuses on an office-based lackey and corporate manager of said superheroes, rather than the heroes themselves. This is a beautifully animated, episodic choice-driven narrative adventure, very much drawing from the team’s history at Telltale Games. So far, only two of eight episodes have been released, with two more launching every week through November 12th. However, be prepared for very little interaction in this interactive experience.</p><p>As the unfortunately named Robert Robertson III (played brilliantly by Aaron Paul), a down-on-his-luck hero without powers, you are a dispatcher for a superhero security company. Instead of cops or security guards, clients call the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN) to assist in all manner of issues, from cats in trees to jewelry heists. Robert manages his own team of reformed supervillains, and it’s up to you to decide which of the misfits to send, based on their personal history and powers. Do you send the crypto-bro manbat to escort a celebrity, or the charismatic popstar with magic light powers? Do you send the stealthy ex-assassin or the girl who can turn invisible to infiltrate a robbery?</p><p>These are the quick choices you make when Robert sits for his first day on the job, after about an hourlong intro. Robert’s choices affect the outcome of the particular emergency, which, if successful, leads to heroes leveling up various attributes. These attributes — like combat and charisma — determine the outcome of a scenario. For example, you wouldn’t send the inarticulate fire superhero to an event that requires a good speaker. The scenarios pop up on his ’90s-era computer screen, much like short emergencies in a <em>SimCity</em> game. You never actually see any animation taking place during these scenarios, given Robert is deskbound and communicating solely via voice. However, having access to just the first two episodes has meant I’ve only dispatched twice, taking up about five to 10 minutes each time.</p><p>Outside of dispatch missions, most of the game involves dialogue and action choices, and quick-time events (though these can be turned off). Anyone who played Telltale’s iconic <em>The Walking Dead</em> will know the mechanics. However, this is one of the most restrictive narrative adventures I’ve played. You don’t even get to control Robert’s movements in terms of walking and talking. This is less a <em>Monkey Island</em> adventure and more <em>Black Mirror</em>’s <em>Bandersnatch</em>. This does seem to allow for consistently stunning and handcrafted animation, however, of a quality to match high-quality adult animated shows like <em>Invincible</em> and <em>Arcane</em>. Add to this a stellar cast — including the aforementioned Paul, there’s Laura Bailey, Jeffrey Wright, Travis Willingham, and others — and it really does feel like a high-budget show.</p><p>The downside is the limited consequences — at least early on. I played the two episodes a few times, given how brief each one is (the first episode took about 30 minutes), and made different choices to see just how different the outcomes would be. Barring a decision in a bar fight that either did or did not lead to a recurring character’s front tooth getting knocked out, very little of the game’s story changed. To be fair, I have no idea how late into the complete season the consequences will manifest. Several times a pop-up of “X will remember that” appeared, but only a few times did I see the outcome of that.</p><p>Related to these limitations are “combat” sequences — despite being quick-time events, the one I experienced had no differing outcome if you just left the buttons alone. You can turn quick-time events off, but even with them on, the outcome doesn’t change. I don’t know what point these quick-time events serve, whether on or off, which speaks to how on-rails and restrictive the game is.</p><p>The story begins with Robert, known as MechaMan, who pilots a giant suit of robot armor, tracking down his dad’s killer. His father, who was MechaMan before him, was murdered by a supervillain named Shroud. In an ensuing fight, the suit is destroyed and Robert is left with nothing. He is soon recruited by an actual superpowered superhero, Blonde Blazer, the most generic “hot blonde” hero you could imagine.</p><p>By contrast, the main character Robert is not at all generic: neither a grump nor entitled windbag. He’s determined, articulate, and thoughtful. He’s given the worst team to manage but takes it as a challenge rather than a slight. While you get to make choices, Robert’s character is very much set.</p><p>The game’s strength lies in its writing and characters. Without the restrictions of working with licensed characters, the developers are wonderfully creative with their heroes. I thoroughly enjoyed the brief interactions between and with the weirdos in spandex you are given. As a non-powered hero, Robert navigates them with both tension and annoyance but not fear. I am looking forward to seeing how relationships develop and with whom Robert bonds.</p><p>But for now I’m only cautiously optimistic about where <em>Dispatch</em> is going. Through the first two episodes — which barely take up two hours, and feature on-rails outcomes, limited interaction, and little idea of the actual plot — I am uncertain. I fell in love with the animation, the voice work, and the characters, but those are elements you can experience as a let’s play on YouTube. Now the game needs to show me why I should play rather than watch.</p><p><sub><em>The first two episodes of</em> Dispatch <em>are available now on the PS5 and Steam.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805679/dispatch-review-steam-ps5]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Upgrading to a new business laptop shouldn’t mean breaking the bank, but it also doesn’t mean settling for something basic just to save money. Ideally, your work laptop should be powerful enough to handle your busiest days, plus support some weekend fun like gaming or streaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>HP offers some of the best options on the market for this, though the performance usually comes with a higher price tag. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Thankfully, that changes today. Amazon is currently offering a mind-boggling 75% discount on the 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, bringing the price down to just $750.</a> Honestly, that’s what you’d pay for most entry-level machines on a normal day, and the offer doesn’t end here. You’re also getting a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase. The only catch? The discount ends soon, meaning you don’t have a lot of time left to grab it. Snag it for less while the offer is still available.</p>

<h2>A Powerful Processor for Impressive Multitasking</h2>
<p>Starting with the performance, you’re getting an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor that’s made to support heavier applications and creative tasks without lags. Along with that, there’s 32GB of RAM to take care of multitasking. Whether your day requires you to hop between multiple programs at once, use a ton of different tabs simultaneously, or test your sanity with longer, never-ending spreadsheets, it’s all going to be possible. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 1TB SSD that’s spacious enough to house all your essentials, plus also ensures faster boot times.</p>



<p>The large 17.3-inch display is much bigger than most other options in this range, and gives you plenty of screen real estate for work and play. Visuals stay lifelike in all lighting conditions, thanks to its anti-glare coating. You’ve also got a full-sized keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use – you won’t be left with a sore wrist at the end of a long work day.</p>
<p>This machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. The operating system is one of the most user-friendly ones out there, and Copilot integration takes the experience even further. You’re going to have an AI assistant ready to help you 24/7. Need help with a math problem? Ask away. Figuring out how long to bake that cake? It’s got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Other freebies include a wireless mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, and a 7-in-1 cleaning kit.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-patch-notes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s upcoming Season 1 will come with a series of different challenges that will change the game for the better. In a post by Battlefield Communications, the patch notes reveal that changes will be coming to some of the game’s absurd challenges, improvements to player visibility, and changes to weapon dispersion.</p>



<p>You can see the full patch notes below; some of which are already live.</p>



<p><em>Live Now:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Search: </strong>We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li>



<li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a> on how to get Full XP in Verified modes.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Upcoming Changes:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Player Movement</strong>: We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience. In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</li>



<li><strong>Progression: </strong>We are continuing to monitor the impact of the changes that were made <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979183830113087566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a> and already seeing a smoother experience as we roll into Season 1. Some additional areas we are tracking:</li>



<li>XP earned in Escalation and King of the Hill is not always working as intended. We are planning to significantly increase the payout to bring them in line with other modes and will keep monitoring once the changes are live.</li>



<li>We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates. Some examples of what we are currently considering are:</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – 30 to 3</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles in a Match – From 6000 to 1000</li>



<li>Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – from 150 to 5</li>



<li>In addition, a later game update will reduce the 200m distance</li>



<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> We are actively looking into adjustments to exposure and brightness. This will lead to improvements in places where players have experienced blinding light when looking outdoors, overly dark interiors when looking indoors, and a lack of visibility around weapon optics when zooming in. These adjustments are part of a wider pass focused on improving visibility that we expect to complete later in Season 1.</li>



<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion: </strong>As part of our Season 1 Update 1 (October 28), we’re making several adjustments to how weapon dispersion behaves. These changes are aimed at ensuring each weapon’s accuracy better reflects its intended performance over range. We’ve also fixed a bug that caused dispersion to not decrease as expected when transitioning from sprinting to a prone position.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ll continue refining how weapon accuracy behaves in battle to make your shots feel more consistent and rewarding across all weapon types. Our upcoming tuning pass will reduce the overall impact of dispersion across multiple weapon types while keeping the core intent intact. Burst-firing will remain the most effective way to control a weapon, and each weapon will still perform best within its intended range. We’ve also identified a couple of bugs that caused weapons to feel less accurate than intended:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Post-Sprint Firing:</strong> Weapons fired immediately after sprinting while zoomed could retain higher dispersion, reducing accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Movement Start:</strong> Dispersion was increasing faster than it should when players began moving, making even small adjustments unexpectedly impact precision. This was especially noticeable on controllers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-regarding-battlefield-labs"><strong>Regarding Battlefield Labs</strong></h2>



<p>We are taking a brief hiatus on Battlefield Labs as we prioritize the rollout of Season 1 content. Labs is at its best when we can iterate quickly with you, and it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6. More updates will be shared when play sessions are returning and we will continue to develop the future of Battlefield 6 together.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-mode-learnings-and-updates"><strong>Battle Royale Mode: Learnings and Updates</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of Battlefield Labs, we have updates on the</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battle Royale mode</a></p>



<p>following the suggestions we received during our play sessions. Your Battlefield Labs feedback has helped us fine-tune key elements for this experience. Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li>



<li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li>
</ul>



<p>We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p>

                <p>The rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">a Simpsons-themed season of Fortnite</a> began earlier this year, but it's been picking up steam in the last few weeks. Now, some apparent leaks have revealed which Simpsons characters will be in the battle pass, and what fans can expect from the map of Springfield.</p><p>According to this leak, the battle pass includes Homer Simpson and his wife, Marge Simpson. Ned Flanders appears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">confirm a previous rumor</a>, but there's no sign of Bart, Lisa, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-add-moe-from-the-simpsons-in-next-major-update-it-seems/1100-6535664/" data-ref-id="1100-6535664">Moe</a>.

Another leak suggests that Fortnite will begin the build up to the new season later today by placing Bart's treehouse in the game.</p><p>A short Fortnite season will launch on November 1, but Epic Games has yet to confirm it will be The Simpsons-themed season.

It wouldn't be the first shadowdrop of a battle royale game, as EA released Apex Legends back in February 2019 without much pre-release hype.</p><p>EA tried its hand at the battle royale space for Battlefield years ago with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-5-firestorm-gameplay-new-battle-royale/1100-6465748/" data-ref-id="1100-6465748">Firestorm mode for Battlefield V back in 2019.</a> The mode didn't exactly catch on, however. The new Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will go up against titles like Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone, and others.</p><p>EA has been testing Battlefield 6's battle royale mode with the Battlefield Labs testing community. The developer just recently provided an overview of some of the changes for battle royale. These include (<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by EA</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>October 28 is also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6's Season 1 arrives</a>, ushering in new maps and modes for multiplayer.</p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a good start following its release on October 10, selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">7 million copies right away</a>, representing the "biggest opening" of all time for the series.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> has launched into early access on PC, available to those who pre-order the game on that platform. For those on consoles or mobile, the game will become available to play a little later on the 4th November.</p>
<p>The beta was pushed back a few hours by developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1981394069147292039">so some final checks on the early access build</a> could be made, but as of writing those who drop £44.99 / 53,99€ / $53.99 can now play the game. It's available on Steam, the Epic Game Store, and the Windows Store. It'll be coming to PC Game Pass soon, alongside the Xbox release in November.</p>
<p>In this early release version of the game, you can hop into a single player career mode or an online career, all progress in both will of course carry over in the full release come November. The game has a revamped interface compared to previous entries in the series, as well as fresh UI, possession formations (not the supernatural kind), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-26-adds-the-womens-game-for-the-first-time-with-official-barclays-womens-super-league-inclusion">and women's teams</a>!</p>

<p>The game also has a revamped manager creator, which allows players to really put those fine touches on the poor soul who'll be blamed for every lost game and subpar benching decision. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-26-will-finally-include-official-fifa-licensing-for-the-first-time-with-a-special-international-management-update-for-the-world-cup">Football Manager announced earlier this month that the series had partnered with Fifa in a multi-year deal</a>, which provides an official licence for big FIFA competitions to the game. This includes the FIFA World Cup 2026, in Canada, Mexico, and the USA.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourselves-football-manager-fans-ive-played-a-day-of-fm26-and-its-going-to-take-a-lot-of-getting-used-to">We've played Football Manager 26, and it'll take some getting used to</a> for series fans. However, if you're sick of hearing about the game and want to see all these changes yourselves, the game currently has a 10% discount during the early access period. Why not buy it, and check it out?</p>

			<p>The October 23 Borderlands 4 patch introduces undocumented performance improvements on PC, according to a new comparison video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>The video shared by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC </a>highlights how the latest update for the new entry in the series by Gearbox Software introduces a roughly 10% performance improvement at both 4K and 1440p resolutions. While barely hitting 59 FPS at 4K resolution on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080 is still a strong indication that more work is needed to improve Borderlands 4, these improvements are a step in the right direction.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these undocumented performance improvements on PC, the Borderlands 4 October 23 patch introduces widespread stability improvements, multiplayer fixes, UI polish and quality-of-life updates to celebrate the game's first month of availability on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>The patch also brings significant balance changes to further refine late-game, mission flow, and the overall player experience. The full details of everything the new patch brings can be found on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/525357766327403014?l=english">official Borderlands 4 October 23 patch notes.</a></p>



<p>While work continues on the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game, the development of the Borderlands 4 Nintendo Switch 2 port is also continuing. Originally scheduled for an October 2025 release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">the port was delayed indefinitely last month</a>, and all pre-orders have been refunded. Given the game's current performance woes on all platforms, the Switch 2 version was likely delayed due to performance concerns.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-development-moderation-phil-spencer-2000638826</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-reveals-his-thoughts-on-xbox-using-ai.1333921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AI arms race is currently eating up hundreds of billions of dollars in investment as companies compete over a technology whose exact benefits are still far from clear. Microsoft is at the center of that fight. How is the head of Microsoft gaming thinking about <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">fitting AI into development</a>? “Our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space,” Phil Spencer said during a recent panel discussion.</p> <p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space">by <em>IGN</em></a>, he was speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California on the topic of “Big Ideas, Small Games: Creativity Beyond the Blockbuster” with Double Fine studio head Tim Schafer <a href="https://kotaku.com/keeper-the-kotaku-review-xbox-game-pass-how-long-is-it-good-price-2000637702">following the release of <em>Keeper</em></a>. Microsoft has been pushing AI into all of its products and CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">bragged about</a> relying on multiple AI assistants throughout the day to run one of the biggest tech firms in the world.</p>

 <p>But it’s less clear how those tools are being used by rank-and-file employees within the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">especially on the gaming side</a>.&nbsp;According to Spencer, Microsoft gaming’s biggest deployment of AI technology right now is in its platform moderation tools. The company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/13/xbox-transparency-report-new-ai-solutions/">announced last year</a> that it’s been using AI tools to help flag and intercept offensive or spam-related communications on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls,” he said during yesterday’s panel. “That’s our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn’t the most glamorous use of AI, but it’s something that I fundamentally believe in.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to other applications on the player-facing front, Spencer suggested AI could also help with one of the biggest challenges in gaming right now: game discovery and curation. “It’s not in practice today, but is there a way for us to use discovery based on things that you’ve done in the past to surface the next thing that you might not know about that might be interesting to you?” he speculated.</p>

 <p>When it comes to game development, however, Spencer seemed to downplay any significant use of AI tools when it comes to things like creating concept art, programming code, or scripting dialogue.&nbsp;“On the creative side, I really leave it up to the teams,” the executive said. “I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate.”</p> <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>On the production side, which I think is where a lot of people go…we don’t have any goals in our model for that to happen. I think more about the pace of creativity, maybe the number of things we can try and take risks on before we decide on our next opportunity. But our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s a far cry from the promises that some gaming company executives are making about how AI can help them drastically cut costs and ship games more quickly and efficiently. Last year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was at “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">the very core</a>” of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher’s business. That company is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">now reportedly banking on an AI</a> revolution to help it service a new $20 billion loan as part of a private equity buyout led by Saudi Arabia.</p>

I love that universe. I’m ready. Anytime”. Krogan? Salarian? Turian? The possibilities are endless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, developer BioWare has yet to pick up the phone and call on Hale to return for Mass Effect 5, but that doesn’t mean we should give up hope. Hale pleaded with fans to let BioWare know that you’d love to see Shepard return somehow — the developers could find a way to make the hundreds of years gap work, I’m sure. Or, perhaps more likely, pop Commander Shepard in the game as a holographic display in some future museum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone out there, the more you tell them what you want, maybe the likelier it is that it'll happen,” Hale said. And who are we to disregard the orders of our Commander?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, all of this was said amid a turbulent time for both BioWare and its parent company, EA. Earlier this year, it was reported that the studio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>had been entirely restructured, following the disappointment of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, to focus entirely on Mass Effect</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, EA was acquired and made private by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo"><u>an investor group composed of the Saudi Arabian PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an eye-watering $55 billion deal.</u></a> It’s currently unclear how this change in ownership has affected projects in development, such as the new Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details may be very thin as to what we can expect next from BioWare’s landmark sci-fi RPG series, but fear not, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-wait-for-mass-effect-5-director-seemingly-confirms-returning-feature"><u>one returning feature has been confirmed by the game’s director</u></a>, Michael Gamble: excessive lens flare.

    <p><span>Cyrene joins the fray in the Amphoreous saga's grand finale.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “As Tomorrow Became Yesterday,” will launch on November 5, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1002255"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga. As Trailblazers brace for their final challenge, Cyrene joins the ranks as a new playable character. Alongside her debut, powerful enemies and exciting limited-time events await, inviting players to embark on the adventure across a world brimming with danger and rewards.</p><p>Over the course of the Amphoreous saga, the Astral Express trio inherited the Titan Coreflames, gaining newfound strength and becoming inextricably bound to Amphoreous’s destiny. Now, the Astral Express crew stands shoulder to shoulder with the Chrysos Heirs, confronting “Irontomb”—the most formidable foe to time itself, in a battle whose weight surpasses anything Amphoreous has ever faced. Yet the conflict extends beyond the paths of Destruction and Erudition, as the forces of Remembrance stir in the dark. With the cosmos on the brink, no great power can afford to remain silent. Through the resolve of the Trailblazers and the wisdom of the geniuses, a Cosmic Alliance begins to rise. </p><p>The final battlefield lies within the “Ruins of Time”, a barren realm where gravel drifts through the air and the horizon fades into an endless wilderness. When Irontomb’s power once stirred prematurely, Phainon poured all his strength into sealing it away—the Trailblazer can see a giant sword piercing into the earth’s core, and a statue that resembles Phainon. He left behind three layers of seals, waiting for the day his companions would return to break them, and together, bring Irontomb to its end.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002323"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the final battle unfolds, Cyrene joins the roster of playable characters. From the very beginning of the Amphoreous journey, she has accompanied the Trailblazers in many different forms. In Version 3.7, Cyrene will finally open up to the Trailblazer she trusts the most, revealing her long-hidden past and the answers behind her mysteries. Cyrene is a 5-star Ice-Type character on the Path of the Remembrance. When she is on the team, the DMG dealt by all allies is increased. Cyrene’s Skill deploys a Zone. While it is active, any damage dealt by an ally to an enemy will trigger an additional instance of True DMG. Meanwhile, every action a teammate takes stacks “Recollection” for Cyrene. When “Recollection” is fully stacked, Cyrene can activate her Ultimate, reaching her most powerful state. When Cyrene uses her Ultimate for the first time, it will instantly activate the Ultimates of all teammates and make her Zone permanent. At this point, she also summons Cyrene in her memosprite form. This “memosprite Cyrene” can choose to enhance any teammate, and if the target is a Chrysos Heir character, they will be granted an exclusive special effect. Furthermore, when memosprite Cyrene takes action, it can either buff teammates or deal damage to all enemies, helping lead the team to victory.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the new version, a large-scale permanent gameplay mode, “Currency Wars,” will make its debut. Trailblazers can form teams of up to ten characters, divided into “on-field” and “off-field” areas that work together in combat. When characters of the same combat type or belonging to the same faction fight side by side, they will trigger special “Bond” effects, unleashing greater power as a team. At launch, “Currency Wars” will feature 61 participating characters, all of whom will be available for free trial. As a major permanent mode, in addition to challenge rewards, it also features a periodic reward system similar to “Divergent Universe,” and will introduce new challenges and growth experiences through updates.</p><p>There’s still plenty for Trailblazers to look forward to in this update. The new event, “Snack Dash,” is on its way, inviting Trailblazers to take part in a lighthearted competition full of creativity and fun. Madam Ruan Mei’s delightful creations will race across obstacle-filled tracks, striving for the finish line and higher rankings. Version 3.7 will also implement the “Trailblaze Fashion” system, giving players more fun cosmetic customization options, including the limited headwear “Deliverer’s Wreath” available for free after completing the version’s Main Missions. Finally, a new animated short, “Hello, World,” and the song  “Ripples of Past Reverie, ” among other new content, will be released to accompany players as they reflect on the journey across the past seven versions and witness the perfect conclusion to the Amphoreus saga.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,637 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

                <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard has teased that "even more" Fallout is coming, with many taking that to be a suggestion about more games in the series.

			<p>At the end of the Ninja Gaiden 4 campaign, Yakumo acquires a fifth weapon, the Dark Dragon Blade, which allows him to fight the game's final boss on equal ground. Here's how to permanently unlock this powerful final weapon in less than 30 minutes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Method tested in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version after the completion of two different playtroughs, which the author played at Normal and Hard difficulty. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> is the final weapon for Yakumo. It is permanently unlocked by completing the following steps:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defeat the Dark Dragon</strong> in Chapter 19 to complete the main campaign. Any difficulty will do. This will unlock additional post-game content, including the <strong>Boss Trial</strong> challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Complete all of the Boss Trial challenges</strong> to permanently unlock the <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> and use it in Story Mode and Challenge Mode, including Chapter Challenge, Purgatorium re-runs, and Combat Trials.</li>
</ol>

<figure><figcaption><em>Use the Senjin War Brew item to increase your attack power and cut down the time needed to defeat the enemy in the Boss Trial challenges</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fighting and defeating all 13 of the main campaign bosses can take significant time and effort, especially powerful bosses like Ryu Hayabusa. However, there is a way to speed up the process considerably taking advantage of some of the game's difficulty mechanics.</p>



<p>This method uses the <strong>Hero Difficulty</strong> setting, which increases your damage output and dramatically lowers boss health, making the challenge trivial:</p>



<ol>

<p>Following this strategy, I completed all 13 trials in<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> 23 minutes and 4.412 seconds</strong>. Even accounting for menu loading and challenge setup, you will need <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">less than 30 minutes</strong> total to unlock the Dark Dragon Blade using this method.</p>

            <p>You are leaving the mission area, soldier! Actually, the mission area is leaving you. It is sick of your shit. It has decided that your foxhole isn’t part of acceptable reality anymore. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s long-awaited battle royale mode seems likely to be revealed on 28th October. In less than a week, we could be laying eyes on the Battlefield interpretation of the well-worn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">Plunkbat</a> and/or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> premise of a vast map fringed by corrosive oblivion that shrinks over time, forcing scavenging players into a claustrophobic last stand.
</p><!--more-->
<p>A datamine of EA’s own app has disclosed (on <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">Xitter</a>, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/battlefield-6-may-be-getting-its-battle-royale-mode-next-week/">VGC</a>) a piece of content for next week’s Battlefield 6 Season 1 rollout called “Granite”. Which isn’t that revealing, but Battlefield 6’s developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">hitherto said</a> that they plan to begin the game’s seasonal update career with a touch of Fortniting, so the timing adds up. 
</p>
<p>“There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale,” they observed earlier this month. Friend, had you told me you were “ideating on new ideas” in-game I’d have gunned you down like a dog, possibly using the M357 Trait sidearm due to be added on November 18th. 
</p>
<p>We already know that Season 1 will bring maps, modes, timed events, vehicles, attachments, guns and melee weapons. The biggest thing missing from the current roadmap is that promised battle royale functionality. Again, the Granite shoe fits. I am interested to see what they call the mode - Battlefield Royale, Player Unknown’s Battlefield 6 and Battlefortnite are all there for the taking.
</p><p>I guess it’s possible that they’re literally adding some granite to Battlefield 6. I’d actually love to play a Battlefield game that blurs the lines with Minecraft in updating the levels with different materials. Possibly this is something you can already do in Battlefield’s Portal editor, when you’re not using it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">jumpstart the progression</a>.</p>
