<p>Firm cites Switch 2 release of Shadows as a contributing factor</p>

<p>In fact, the firm states that the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise has "overperformed" this quarter, noting that year-on-year growth in active users is in "double-digits". The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the Switch 2 has been cited as a contributing factor, which Ubisoft says enabled the title to "broaden its audience". It also mentions the <strong>Valley of Memory</strong> update for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, which launched in November 2025.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0ejuhzmq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ubisoft is pushing ahead with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">big company restructure</a>. It's currently consulting with employees at its Paris headquarters with a view to reduce its headcount by 200. Meanwhile, it's aiming to finalise its new operating model in April. This will consist of five 'creative houses', with the flagship – Vantage Studios – already operational since October 2025. This creative house will focus on Assassin's Creed, <strong>Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
<p>"In parallel, we are making progress on the transformation announced in January. The allocation of studios and capabilities across the Creative Houses and Network has now been announced, and key leadership appointments are ongoing, including external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans. This transformation is designed to sharpen focus, accelerate decision-making and elevate our creative ambition in an increasingly selective market. Vantage Studios has been operational since October and we are preparing for the rest of this new operating model to start running in early April."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time will tell, but it seems like Ubisoft will be keen to continue supporting the Switch 2 going forwards. Indeed, it's looking more and more likely that a remaster/remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag</a> will launch in the near future. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-pops-up-on-amazon">An art book</a> for the release was spotted on Amazon UK, giving us yet another clear indication of the game's existence.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered Art Book Listing Spotted on Amazon UK With March 2026 Release]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/</link>
            <guid>1433863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">1,200 Ubisoft employees</a></strong> are on strike this week in response to the company's recent "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>," yet another piece of evidence regarding the heavily rumoured <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> remaster has appeared online. Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=04knYK8dAZ2TRI8dBP6GJEH">Amazon UK listing</a> for an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered art book is up and available for pre-orders. It also, interestingly, has a <strong>March 24, 2026, release date</strong> attached to it.</p>



<p>What makes the art book seem legit, beyond the fact that Ubisoft is listed as the book's author, is that <strong>Titan</strong>, the publisher behind <a href="https://titanbooks.com/catalog/?q=assassin%27s%20creed&amp;page=1">several Assassin's Creed artbooks</a>, is also listed as the publisher for this upcoming book. The book is listed at <strong>£39.99 RRP</strong>, though if it is real, you can grab it on sale right now for <strong>£29.95</strong>.</p>



<p>Assuming this is a legitimate listing, firstly, the release date listed for the art book <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">does line up with what we've previously heard</a> about when the rumoured remaster is set to release. Secondly, the fact that this listing has even appeared lines up with what we heard earlier this week about the coming remaster, which is that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">are due for a reveal in the near future</a> (though not at tonight's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, reportedly).</p>



<p>One interesting thing to note about this art book, however, is that according to a <strong>PEGI rating</strong> spotted back in December 2025, the remaster is officially titled <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a></strong>. Again, if the art book is real, this could just be a placeholder title for the listing, or even just a mistake on the part of whoever inputted the information for the listing.</p>



<p>We've seen several reports and rumours about this upcoming remaster/remake for years now. It's arguably one of the worst-kept secrets in the video game industry, and yet, we've had nothing official from Ubisoft. The French company had no problem <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">threatening the actor who played Black Flag protagonist <strong>Edward Kenway</strong> with a lawsuit</a> for even slightly suggesting the remaster was coming soon, but as of yet, it won't confirm one way or another if the remaster/remake is even happening.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear something sooner rather than later, so we can put this run of rumours and reports to rest and focus on what's actually coming down the pipeline.</p>

            <p>
This is probably a sentence that could be said literally any day of the week, but a new cosy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> sim is on the block, this time taking the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starsand-island">Starsand Island</a>. The flavour on this occasion is of the anime variety, with some slightly goofier farming mechanics (i.e. turning your watermelon patch into one singular, 10 foot tall watermelon), some very Pokemon Legends: Arceus looking combat, and some appropriately cute animals to hang out with. And there's skateboarding! But never do launches go all that smoothly, as developer Seed Sparkle Lab have had to do a dash of damage control regarding some concerns over the game.
</p>
<p>
A pair of update posts were shared today, the second of which we'll start with. For one, it appears a bunch of potential early adopters of the early access release have been concerned with in-game purchases, but according to said <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319774?l=english">update post</a>, there are none! "Please enjoy the game with confidence," so say the devs.
</p>
<p>
The second concern that was addressed was regarding some potentially dodgy lines in the game's user agreement, partially in relation to those supposed in-game purchases, but also partially to do with things like mods being restricted. According to the devs however, "All unreasonable or overly restrictive clauses in the user agreement have been removed. We will never restrict players from using mods or other custom content, and there is no anti-cheat system implemented in the game. After the full release, Steam Workshop will also be opened to allow everyone to freely create and share their ideas."
</p>
<p>
There has also been some feedback over a lack of story bits and voice acting, which has been duly noted as well, including some optimisation issues, though there are plans for improvements on all counts. "Starsand Island is not perfect, and we will continue to listen carefully to the voices from our players while constantly improving and refining the game," the post explains.
</p><p>
Regarding that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772?l=english">first update post</a>, however, is a strange situation where a bunch of positive reviews have popped up that appear to be AI-generated. Seed Sparkle Lab say they don't understand why this is happening either, asking whoever is behind this to stop. Better than review bombing I suppose? But maybe cut it out anyway, just a weird thing to do.
</p>
<p>
If you have any interest in picking up Starsand Island, you can do so on Steam, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new report claims that following high-profile examples of rich people being killed or robbed, the wealthy elite are more nervous than ever about poor people or criminals robbing them, or worse. To defend against this, many are turning their multi-million dollar mansions into spaces that closely resemble <em>Hitman</em> levels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/luxury-home-security-aca080d7">A new <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> shows that a lot of the richest people in the United States are on edge after events like the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/among-us-luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-murder-1235199846/">assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</a> in New York City in 2024 and the shooting of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner and others in 2025. There have also been some high-profile burglaries, including the homes of Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, and Kansas City Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes. Reportedly many rich celebs and executives are also nervous about sites that <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">let people track private jets and yachts</a>. To ease their fears, many of the richest people around are spending millions on adding security features like laser grids, moats, armed guards, and AI-powered cameras to their mansions.</p>

 <p>“Prior to the wide use of social media, most CEOs—whether they’re in private equity, finance or tech—no one knew their names or what they looked like, with few exceptions,” said Miami luxury real estate agent Danny Hertzberg. “Now, people are tracking them.”</p> <p>One former tech mogul turned real estate agent showed off a $15 million mansion compound in Arizona that included 32 “casino-grade cameras” and a “laser intrusion detection system” around the home’s large perimeter. The house’s front door is made out of three-inch-thick solid steel and includes 13 deadbolts. Around the house are also sour orange trees with four-inch spikes intended to deter people from sneaking around. And in front of all that is a moat. Meanwhile, inside the house is a reinforced concrete bunker with a 2,000-pound door and an air filtration system built to extremely high standards.</p>

 <p>And this is far from the only mansion being turned into a challenging <em>Hitman</em> level. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> says roughly 45 percent of high-end homes sold last year included a reference to privacy or security. That’s up from 38 percent in 2024.</p>

 <p>In Vegas, a luxury design firm says clients are now spending $100,000 to $1.5 million just on security features like safe rooms and cameras. In Florida, another building company is working to incorporate biometric access, facial recognition, and iris scanning into its security systems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in places like Beverly Hills, developers are contracting security firm Arsec Group to provide 24/7 armed guard for their latest collection of high-end homes inside a gated community. Mikey Arana, founder of Arsec, says many of his clients in California are increasingly worried about being followed and robbed after a night out on the town wearing pricey clothes and jewelry. &nbsp;The armed guards carry 9mm pistols and observe the property via infrared cameras.</p>

 <p>“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to stop violent action is with a violent response,” said Arana.</p>

            <guid>1433845</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>How time flies. It only seems like yesterday we had the last State of Play, and yet here we are with Sony delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time. We'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article, as we always do, in exactly the same way. The games will be different, though, I hope.</p>
<p>As always can chat along with us and let us know what you think of the games. Some people like to be mean, others are quite positive about everything - it really depends on if every other game is a soulslike or not.</p>
<p>What's in tonight's show is a bit of a guess at this point. It looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">Wolverine isn't going to be here</a>, but we expect to see Saros, and perhaps an update on Fairgames if it's still in development. Shall we say it? Worth a go, I guess... maybe there'll be a Bloodborne remaster too? Unlikely, but one day, maybe, if we all hope hard enough.</p>
<p><em>Anyway.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us for what is bound to be an hour or so of at least mild entertainment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Sensei Sergio moves with purpose, instructing people to follow plans that were clearly laid out well in advance. He appears to be listening to no one and yet is aware of everyone. If the resistance is a sprawling organism, then he is its lungs, bringing with him a steady cadence of oxygen, a rhythmic expulsion of the chaos that can poison. He makes no proclamations. He is simply about The Work.&nbsp;</p><p>As Slate’s Sam Adams wrote in<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samadams.bsky.social/post/3mbsb26hjqk22?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this consideration</u></a> of actor Benicio del Toro’s performance in <em>One Battle After Another</em> for the New York Film Critics’ Circle awards:</p><blockquote>In the midst of a story about would-be revolutionaries agitating for sudden change, Sergio embodies the opposite - not acquiescence, but methodical, sustained resistance. Unlike the French 75's headline-grabbing pyrotechnics or the Christmas Adventurers Club's sinister cabal, Sergio's "Latino Harriet Tubman situation" has no name, no manifesto or underground lair, just a wide-spreading network of people waiting for their moment to do the right thing.</blockquote><p>In a little over a month, <em>One Battle After Another</em> will be recognized across a<a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/news/oscar-nominations-2026-sinners-one-battle-after-another-1236632380/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> dozen Oscar categories</u></a>, including a nomination for del Toro’s Sensei Sergio. That the film, which follows resistance movements and revolutionaries of all sorts, could garner such nominations and be considered a favorite to win many of the awards it’s up for, feels significant in a moment of American history when citizens log on to social media every day to see normal damn people enduring a sustained campaign of violence from an unaccountable secret police force roving their streets and abducting and murdering their neighbors. They are also seeing people who look like them learn to not just fight back with whistles and marches and costumes, but protect one another.&nbsp;</p><p>In an entertainment landscape dominated by efforts to exploit intellectual property in increasingly shallow ways, a work that speaks to this moment so vividly feels like something that shouldn’t happen, at least from a major Hollywood studio.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>But here’s the strange part: <em>One Battle After Another</em> is not the only one. Many of this year’s Oscar nominations are uniquely concerned with resistance. <em>Sinners</em>, which leads the pack with 16 nominations, explores this in a multitude of ways outside the direct political confrontation of <em>One Battle After Another</em>. In his layered Mississippi fable, writer-director Ryan Coogler frames the marginalized’s efforts to make a space for themselves to make merry, make music, and make love with one another to be an important part of the work itself.&nbsp; In a move that garnered undue criticism, Coogler underlined this theme by negotiating that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-coogler-owning-sinners-movie-rights-2025-4?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the ownership of the film fully revert to him after 25 years</u></a> — which led trade publications to spend weeks undercutting the film’s financial success, expressing open pessimism at <em>Sinners</em>’ ultimate profitability. Sixteen Oscar nominations later, it is effectively the success story of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>And these are just the two most-nominated films. Meditations on resistance can be seen all over the ballot. <em>The Secret Agent</em>, Kleber Mendonça Filho’s daring, deeply humane thriller, makes a surprising and sudden pivot from tense cat-and-mouse game to a moving rumination on how remembering the stories of those who stood up to authoritarian regimes — win, lose, or draw — is also part of The Work. <em>Frankenstein</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s loving rendition of Mary Shelley’s gothic classic, depicts a creature coming of age (and rage) in opposition to a creator who embodies the worst of masculinity, all ego and power and no responsibility. Jafar Panahi, the Iranian filmmaker whose entire career has effectively been an ongoing campaign of cinema-as-resistance, has once again been nominated for an award he may <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/04/nx-s1-5696562/jafar-panahi-mehdi-mahmoudian-it-was-just-an-accident?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not be able to accept</u></a>. His film <em>It Was Just an Accident</em> is a tragicomic dilemma about whether or not one can move on after the fight is over and you have survived — as did those who oppressed you.</p><p>Award shows are statements. A work recognized by an institution with industry clout sets the bounds of what is acceptable and worthy of recognition within that industry. An award can be a bar to clear or a standard to rail against. It’s what a majority of luminaries are comfortable saying represents them, their field, and the potential of their craft. These are political concerns first — “political” in the intra-group dynamic sense — and artistic ones second.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s notable, then, when a nearly century-old institution like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominates a slate of films that are openly working through ideas of resistance and revolution. And it’s meaningful that those movies aren’t just symbolic nominations, but favored to win big.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>In some ways, you can read resistance into most art. The word is synonymous with conflict, after all, a fundamental aspect of storytelling. Something is demanded of a protagonist. The protagonist says no. Basic Joseph Campbell stuff. Hero's journey, and all that.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywFDoT7LBbQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="If I Had Legs I'd Kick You | Official Trailer HD | A24"></iframe></figure><p>Or maybe the audience expects a certain structure, or presentation. And the filmmaker, like <em>If I Had Legs, I'd Kick You</em> director Mary Bronstein, says no. You will not see the face of protagonist Linda's (Rose Byrne, up for Best Actress) daughter, but you will hear her constantly, see her tiny limbs suggesting the complete, needy child just out of frame. You will be uncomfortable in this visual tension, and perhaps experience anxiety. An anxiety that might reflect Linda's, her face frequently in extreme close-up, another voice that should be present, her husband's, also frustratingly off-screen. Doesn't it make you want to scream?&nbsp;</p><p>The difference between <em>conflict</em> of an elemental sort and <em>resistance</em> as a device is entirely subjective. And that's the point: If you feel, as I do, that there's something in the air, that the films represented in the 98th Academy Awards represent ideas of resistance in a powerfully coherent way – odds are that this is because of the moment we are living in, informed by the ways in which our individual readings align.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not, in other words, believe that Hollywood is Resistance HQ. What it is, is an institution: one with easily identifiable incentives and a clearly-mapped power structure that artists must navigate – or subvert –&nbsp; in order to get their work out into the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Reactionary pundits are often quick to assert some kind of liberal agenda at work, which is a funny thing to say about such a system. Sure, famous people are fond of taking liberal positions in public, but the place exists to make money, and studios are no more noble than tech companies (and increasingly, they <em>are</em> tech companies). They are not in the business of revolution.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>People come to ideas, come to push against the weight of institutions, in their own individual ways. The work that results from that – how a filmmaker works with or against the studio system, the circumstances of its production and distribution, the attitudes, beliefs, and inflections of the many hands that touch even the smallest films on their way to the screen –&nbsp; can then inform the audience's individual struggles against institutions, towards self-determination and actualization. The gears of industry that all commercial art forms must survive are cold and uninterested in rupturing the status quo, but creative industries still require people, and those people are more often than not still legible at the end of the process. That's why a person can still connect with a film Hollywood chooses to produce or celebrate, even as Hollywood, the industry, is only concerned with furthering its own relevance and mindshare. The connection we can form with a film – and, more importantly, with each other in our appreciation of a film – , has real value, as does any medium that helps&nbsp; people find each other and have conversations that bring them closer together.</p><p>There are limits to this. About an hour into <em>One Battle After Another</em> that illustrates the hazards of being satisfied with art about resistance and revolution. Bob Ferguson (Leonardo DiCaprio), is in hiding with his daughter in Northern California, sixteen years after the implosion of his revolutionary group, the French 75. He is paranoid and frequently stoned out of his mind, self-medicating his way through a life off the grid in order to give his daughter a chance at a relatively normal life. He lights up and puts on <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>, the ur-text when it comes to films about resistance and revolution, influencing everything from <em>Red Dawn </em>to <em>Children of Men</em> to <em>Andor</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the state that he's in when the State arrives at his doorstep, finally catching up to him after his many years as a ghost. For the rest of the film, Bob must learn the ways in which the struggle has moved on and evolved without him. This is played for comedy, in frustrated conversations with Comrade Josh or his obliviousness to the elaborate plans Sensei Sergio is executing right in front of him. Bob is out of step with his movement, but the movement is there for him. Waiting for him to catch up and figure out how the fight has changed, while he was busy getting high and being content with stories about people getting involved, believing his part in the struggle over.</p><hr><p>Those movies are also a good way to talk a little bit about what I intend to do here, in this column I’m calling The Work. In it, I intend to explore resistance in fiction, both in theme (art that is expressly about the act of resistance) and form (art that is constructed in a way that is meant to be difficult). The purpose isn’t necessarily education, or the formation of a syllabus. I am not a scholar of revolutionary history; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjP3HEQ0F-8B6x_9l4bJef2q4hFvb9s0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>there</u></a> <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>are</u></a> others who do that work. Nor do I believe that engaging with overtly political art, no matter how relevant or provocative, is in any way comparable to direct political action or engaging with your community. Art, however, can help us process these things, and perhaps that’s one of my goals here: To consider where art might fit in.</p><p>This is personal to me. Once, in a difficult moment in my life, I didn’t have anyone to go to and didn’t know what to do. My grandfather, the first and best cinephile I knew, could tell I was in a bad way, but didn’t know how to help. Not his fault, really; I wouldn’t have told him if he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>“Let me put on this movie,” he said. “Maybe it’ll help you know what to do.”&nbsp;</p><p>The movie was <em>Scaramouche</em>, George Sidney’s 1952&nbsp; swashbuckler set just prior to the French Revolution. Based on a novel by Rafael Sabatini, the story follows André Moreau, a cad and layabout who discovers his best friend Philippe is secretly Marcus Brutus, a notorious pamphleteer wanted by the aristocracy. In short order a nobleman, Noel, the Marquis de Mayne, discovers Philippe’s identity and makes a show of killing him in a duel. Vowing revenge, Moreau goes into hiding with a circus and becomes the clown Scaramouche, secretly training with master swordsmen until he has the skill to take his revenge.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzYEYyOsQtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Scaramouche (1952) Official Trailer - Stewart Granger, Janet Leigh Swashbuckler Movie HD"></iframe></figure><p>It’s a great movie: a real classic romance, lots of fencing and romantic overtures. But mostly it’s about a man who doesn’t believe much of anything learning that the sidelines are not static, that eventually conflict comes to your door and demands that you make a choice. Watching it with my grandfather, I took it as the nudge I needed to finally start doing things because I believed in them, rather than because anyone expected me to. I had to take action, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right one.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s what art can do. It’s a draft through a window, pushing open a door  you  thought was closed. It sits with you as you go wherever you need to go to find clarity, meaning, purpose. It’s how you can let others know you’re there for them, whenever they may need you. You let it in you and out of you, breathing deeply, like Sensei Sergio.&nbsp;</p><p>And then you go about The Work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back to the recent charts, fourth place goes to another new release, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/nioh_3">Nioh 3</a>, the action RPG sequel which has been a critical hit with reviewers. But it isn't close to Dragon Quest at all, shifting 40,570 units on PS5.</p>
<p>It's another big drop to reach the rest of the charts, then, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and a few other Switch 1 and 2 regulars making up the list.</p>

<p>In contrast to software sales, hardware tells a very similar story to last week, as numbers continue to slip <em>very</em> slightly. The Switch 2 was again the only single console to sell over 10,000 units this week, shifting another 65,807 units.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 skus sold a combined 8,892 units, with the majority of those sales coming from the Switch Lite. In comparison, the PS5's three skus sold 11,130. It seems like more and more players are migrating over to the Switch 2 in Japan.</p>
<p>So, another quiet week for the console market — let's have a look at the full hardware charts:</p>

              <p>We first learned that the frosty survival game <em>The Long Dark&nbsp;</em>was getting a sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/24">during 2024’s Game Awards</a>. Called&nbsp;<em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</em>, the follow-up to 2017’s excellent first-person game about surviving in the Canadian wilderness was said to be coming to early access in 2026. That’s no longer the case, with developer Hinterland’s founder Raphael van Lierop now saying it won’t be out in any form this year, and as a consequence 10 full-time developers and four contractors from the studio are being let go.</p> <p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues,” begins a statement from van Lierop <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvanlierop_some-very-sad-news-from-hinterland-today-share-7427536054947045376-f305/">posted to LinkedIn</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hinterland-confirms-layoffs-after-delaying-the-long-dark-sequel"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). “We also will not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14.”</p>

 <p>The reasons given allude to wider industry issues, but suggest the primary issue is that <em>Blackfrost</em> won’t be in a state to enter early access this year, which van Lierop says “means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our other games.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668230"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668230">© Hinterland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em> was first released in its earliest form in 2014, following a successful Kickstarter the previous year. One of the rare examples of a truly purposeful early access development, the shiver-inducing first-person survival sim then released regular significant updates, each developing its core ideas in new and interesting directions, until its splendid 2017 final version. And all of them ensured you were always likely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-impres-oh-ive-been-eaten-by-a-wolf">to be eaten by a wolf</a>. Its only stumble was the initial addition of its Wintermute story mode, the first two of the five chapters failing to win many over, but even these were later recreated in a far better form. Astonishingly, the fifth chapter still isn’t out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">last said to be arriving on March 31, 2026</a>, and van Lierop says the new layoffs will not affect its release. Planned updates for the original game that are scheduled to appear this year are also apparently unaffected.</p>

 <p>“This is a heavy, heavy day for Hinterland,” says the CEO, “and our hearts are with all those affected by today’s layoff. I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.” The statement says efforts have been made to help those affected find new work, adding, “Any development studio in the industry would be fortunate to have any single one of these team members. We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

 <p>Being a weaker studio will surely further hinder development of <em>Blackfrost</em>, not least given the intention was never to release a finished game this year, but rather its earliest playable version. Hopefully some additional money will come in to Hinterland with today’s news that the original <em>The Long Dark</em> is finally returning to GOG, after <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_long_dark_removal/page1">being mysteriously pulled from the store in 2018</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_long_dark">on the freshly independent PC gaming store with a 25-percent discount for the next week</a>.</p>

And there’s these talking cats, and they’re pretty cute, too. We’re kinda leaving money on the table by not making this a turn-based monster-capturing RPG.” And the executives did grin, and the sky opened, and the money rained down.

Naturally, I thought this was Leia. Extremely loud incorrect buzzer. It was actually her mamma, who is the queen of Azuria. She hacks the egg out of the crystal and brings it home, where it hatches into the Monster Hunter poster child, a Rathalos. The Rathalos is extinct in Azuria, so everyone’s pretty stoked about this, especially little Leia, who says she hears two sounds coming from the egg. Turns out she’s right, and a second Rathalos has hit the throne room. As Leia, enamored, reaches out for her new friends, a vaguely vizier-shaped dude informs the king that while one monster is all fine and dandy, two monsters, especially two Skyscale Rathalos (Rathaloses? Rathalosi?) is Bad News, Chief ™ and only one may be allowed to live. Cut to black. Surely this will not irrevocably traumatize my girl Leia for the rest of her days and become a crucial part of her backstory. Surely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several years later, Leia, now a young woman, is following in her mother’s footsteps and studying a monster preserved in egg quartz when her buddy Simon appears and summons her back to the castle. Once there, we learn that Leia is the Captain of the Rangers and that she’s studying something called the Encroachment. Proper nouns are generally bad, and Leia has really made progress on the Encroachment, but that’s maybe not the most pressing concern. Relations with the neighboring kingdom of Vermeil are fraying, and her father warns Leia that the Rangers might see combat. Leia protests, as that’s not what Rangers exist for (they’re here for the monsters), but she rides Azuria’s only Rathalos (uh oh), and they may need her. My girl is also informed that she will attend talks with Vermeilian envoys, and that her conspicuously absent mother was Vermeilian. In a later conversation with Simon, Leia reveals that her mother is known as “The Turncoat Queen.” The plot thickens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Leia can’t spend too much time thinking about that. She’s the captain of the Rangers, and she has a job to do. That means training new recruits, and you’re got a fresh one in Thea, who is stoked to be here and learn from Azuria’s only Rathalos rider and Rudy, my Felyne. This is where my time with Twisted Reflection really takes off. In training Thea, Twisted Reflection is training me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I learn how to ride my Rathalos (your monsters are called Monsties), but things really kick into gear once we enter combat for the first time. Like I said at the jump, combat is turn-based. Attacks come in three types; Power, Technical, and Speed. Power beats Technical and Technical beats Speed, which loops around and beats Power. Normally, these attacks work, well… normally. But if a monster is targeting you and you attack it, you’ll enter a Head-to-Head where the rock, paper, scissors of it all will play out. And if and your Monstie are attacking the same foe and a Head-to-head happens, you’ll get a Double Attack. Monsters have their own attack preferences. Velociprey, for instance, will prioritize Speed, so you gotta go Technical if you want to win. If you’re in the market for something a little fancier, you’ve also got abilities, though these take Stamina, so you can’t just spam them.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you’ve also got your Monstie. You don’t control them directly so much as give them standing commands that they carry out when it's their turn, whether that means going for a regular attack or an ability, some of which carry elemental properties like fire, lightning, or water. Since Leia’s the main character, she’s also got additional Monsties she can switch to if the one she needs isn’t right for what you’re up against. Thea and her Monstie, Kaguchi, are also in my party, but I don’t control them. They do their own thing, for better and worse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of this, combat goes quickly, and like your more traditional Monster Hunters, there’s strategy when it comes to which part of the monster you’re fighting that you target. Break the right body part, and you can weaken an attack or open it up to more damage. Stagger a monster, and you can unleash a Synchro Attack where everyone in your party lays on the hurt. The biggest spectacle, though, comes in the form of kinship attacks. Pull off the right moves in combat, and you’ll build kinship with your Monstie. Max out that meter, and you can mount your Monstie and unleash a beautifully animated, cinematic smackdown. I dig it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Thea and I are broken in, we get to explore a bit. We pick up plants and bugs and other items on the ground, get into some fights, and I give Ratha a break so I can use my Tobi-Kadachi to scale a lookout point and meet an Explorer Felyne who gifts me a map. We continue on, learning how to use melee and breath attacks to interact with the environment and start fights early for an advantage, or roar and get monsters out of the way. We also manage to rescue a Poogie, an adorable, pig-like creature who somehow got up somewhere my Rathalos needed wings to reach, and even get Thea a taste of the Encroachment, which seems to be what causes those egg quartzes we saw earlier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, things are looking pretty good for the home team, until we come across a nest and make a Paolumu mad. Once we whack him enough, he transforms, altering his attacks and weaknesses. Since he’s inflated an air pouch, it’s bow time. It’s a fun fight that puts everything I’ve learned so far to the test, but it’s nothing compared to what comes next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, we run into our first feral monster, which has been altered by the Encroachment. Crystals sprout from its back, and it’s extremely powerful. Hitting the crystals provokes a backlash attack, so we have to be smart. It tests our smarts and our patience, but eventually he wears down, and we destroy the crystals. Then it’s game on. Eventually, he falls, and we take the eggs we’ve gathered home and add some new Monsties to our ranks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we start feeling too good about ourselves, Leia is called into that meeting with the Vermeilian envoys. Things are going badly – Vermeil is getting hit hard by the Encroachment, and they’re convinced salvation lies in the Sacrosanctum, which would mean breaching an ancient pact. They’ve come to ask Azuria for help getting there – and war seems inevitable until Vermeil’s Princess Eleanor offers herself as a hostage until Azuria relents. Unwilling to treat her like a prisoner, Leia offers to show her around, and she ends up palling around with the Rangers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If bringing Thea along was about learning the game, Eleanor’s arrival is really where things open up. Before setting out, we acquire new skills and forge new armor and weapons. It’s a good thing, too, because while we’re showing Eleanor around, we run into a new feral monster. Eleanor, her Anjanath (which I’m pretty jealous of, honestly), my Monstie cohort, and I take it down, but not before we’re knocked down a few times ourselves. Losing all your HP isn’t fatal. You can get back up a limited number of times, but it lets us know that the challenge is ramping up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after, we set up a camp, and Eleanor shows off her cooking skills. This is a Monster Hunter game, so eating food naturally boosts your stats and the cooking cutscene is immaculately rendered. I go for some experience-boosting bread, because who doesn’t love bread? Leia and Eleanor also bond over their shared realization that their countries don’t really understand each other. The situation in Vermeil is worse than Leia realized, and Azuria isn’t at all like Eleanor thought. Neither is as bad as they’ve been led to believe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our goal now is to investigate invasive monsters and track them to their dens so we can save eggs from the species they’re crowding out. From here, the world is essentially our oyster. We have to operate at night to track these invasive species, but otherwise we can kinda do what we want, whether that means fighting monsters in the field, or completing side quests where we reunite a Felyne with his lost master or help another Felyne get rid of some bug monsters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we find an invasive Yian Garuga. We steer clear long enough to analyze its tracks and get a feel for how it works, but eventually, the fight is on. The Yan Garuga is incredibly strong; in a stand-up fight, we probably wouldn’t stand a chance, and we’ve got to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off a few times before it’s over. But our goal isn’t to kill it, it’s to make it retreat to its lair. That means figuring out its weakness – in this case, its legs – and piling on the hurt fast enough that it stumbles when trying to hit us with a powerful charge attack and retreats. Once it does, we track it to its lair and steal a Rathian egg, but we’re not looking to make it a Monstie. By releasing it into the wild, we can restore the natural ecosystem. That means new and better monsters for us to catch. Restoring a habitat has benefits for us, too. You might get monsters with elemental skills unique to that habitat, or unlock mutations that imbue monsters with elements outside of the norm. It’s sad to see our Rathian go, but it’s for the greater good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our task complete, the Rangers return to the castle. The king’s still focused on what might happen if the Rangers have to go into battle, and we learn why Leia’s so opposed to it. Remember that other Rathalos that came out of that egg? She saved it as it was about to be executed and fled. Everyone assumes she headed to her native Vermeil. The whole Traitor Queen thing makes a lot more sense now, and it explains why Leia’s so fond of her own Rathalos – he got her through her mom leaving – and why she’s so devoted to the Rangers. She wants to find out what happened to her mom.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/mhst3-raisingmonsters04-1770860110369.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As if inspired by this revelation, Twisted Reflection decides to open up Side Stories – escapades you can head on with other Rangers to get to know them better. I decide to pal around with Eleanor, who, impressed with Azuria’s beauty and abundance, tasks us with tracking down some items that are native to Vermeil: a Sucklebug, Witherweed, and a Molted Gumshell. After getting the lay of the land from a nearby lookout tower – and a few side excursions where we grabbed some eggs from monster dens –  we headed out. The first couple were easy enough. Hitting a Paolumu with a breath attack snags us our Gumshell, and we find Witherweed in a shady area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real bugaboo turns out to be the Sucklebug, which likes to hide behind rocks. I searched for it <em>behind</em> rocks for a while before realizing that “behind the rock” means “break the rock, Will, you doofus.” Once we’ve got all the ingredients – yes, ingredients – Eleanor turns them into Vermeil Dumplings. Leia and Rudy are grossed out, but it’s a nice moment that helps them understand just how dire things are in Vermeil – and how lucky Azuria is by comparison. Plus, it unlocks a new recipe for our camps, and Eleanor is excited to share her local cuisine with everyone else.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/mhst3-habitatrestoration01-1770860135191.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection ends shortly thereafter. I could have kept going – we had access to a generous amount of the game – but my next story mission saw me getting absolutely rocked by a pair of Feral Velocidomes. I clearly needed to get some new Monsties with different elements and upgrade equipment to continue, but it felt like a natural end. I’d spent half a dozen hours with Twisted Reflection by that point, and gotten a feel for what it was shaping up to be: a gorgeous RPG that combines the traditional elements of Monster Hunter with a turn-based RPG and a surprisingly compelling cast and narrative that invited me to befriend and train monsters, not just hunt them. Don’t get me wrong, those Velicidomes are going down the next time I fire Twisted Reflection up, but for now, I have a feel for this world, these characters, and the game they inhabit. And it was more than enough to convince me to turn this snack into a meal. I might just stick with the bread, though, you know? Vermilian Dumplings don’t really seem like my bag.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-preview-me-and-my-pet-rathalos]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fable creator Peter Molyneux has said there was a pitch document for Fable 4 at Lionhead Studios, but that he left the company before he could see what came of it.</p>
<p>"We did have a proposition for Fable 4," Molyneux told me this week in a video interview. "And again, it was the thought of moving through time a little bit more, a little bit further." What he means by that is Fable 4 would adhere to an overarching storyline that connected the Fable games together.</p>
<p>"When we were thinking about Fable 1, we were also thinking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-2">Fable 2</a>," he explained. "We thought in Fable 1, it was the start of the Heroes Guild, and then Fable 2 will move time on. And we always had this notion that industry and technology were stamping out the magic in Fable, and you can see that with the three [games]."</p>
<p>So: "We had a pitch document," he said, "which I think was proposed at the time. But that was just at the time that I was leaving Lionhead so I wasn't there for the full exploration of it." In other words, he didn't get to pitch it, or see where it went. "No, no, I didn't."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-exits-microsoft-lionhead">Peter Molyneux left Microsoft and Lionhead in 2012</a>, after being shunted up the hierarchy to become a high-ranking member of Microsoft Studios. The last Fable game he was involved in was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-the-journey-review">the on-rails Kinect spin-off Fable: The Journey</a>, in 2012, which wasn't bad actually, but felt like it had been created out of a necessity to have Microsoft studios make Kinect games. There was also a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-heroes-review">n Xbox Live multiplayer Fable beat-'em-up that year called Fable Heroes</a>. Perhaps, in Microsoft's eyes, Fable had become oversaturated.</p>
<p>It has of course been many years now since we've had a mainline Fable game, hence the excitement around Playground's Fable series reboot, which is simply called Fable, and which we got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SYbP7PGmfg">a first proper gameplay glimpse at earlier this year</a>. Molyneux told me he watched this so I asked what he thought of it, to which he replied, "Well, I cried, obviously." We had previously been talking about how emotional he can be.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," he added. "Because it just made me unbelievably proud that we created something which persists and that people care about. What they've done is they've taken that world and they made it far more graphically rich than we were ever capable of doing. I would say it looks a little bit antiseptically clean - that's a little bit of a tiny negative. But I love the idea that they're revisiting the original story. And I love the idea that it's somewhat like the original Fable was. It just makes me feel insanely proud that something we worked so hard on is going to continue to exist."</p>
<blockquote><em>"It just made me unbelievably proud that we created something which persists and that people care about"</em></blockquote>
<p>Molyneux went on to say that Playground Games hadn't contacted him to talk about Fable, which he completely understands. "They wanted it to be their own creation," he said. "And they come across as such wonderful fans." All of the quirky parts of the series seem to be present and correct in Playground's interpretation. It must be flattering to see, I said. "Incredibly flattering," he responded. "It all looked fantastic to me."</p>
<p>Playground's Fable reboot will be released in the autumn on PC and Xbox and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peter Molyneux is going back to his god game roots with a new game of his own, Masters of Albion, which shares more than a few similarities with the Fable series. That game enters early access on 22nd April. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-going-to-be-a-very-long-goodbye-peter-molyneuxs-last-game-will-be-masters-of-albion-but-thats-not-necessarily-as-simple-as-it-sounds">Masters of Albion will also, apparently, be Peter Molyneux's last video game</a> - a claim I explored with him in a larger interview.</p>

<p>At least, according to Kadokawa's latest financial report</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="38beb9716a6bd"><a title="The Duskbloods" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38beb9716a6bd/the-duskbloods.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p>If everything goes to plan, FromSoftware is poised to have a big 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> were announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct in April 2025, but things have been pretty quiet for both games since.</p>
<p>However, both titles have been mentioned in Kadokawa's (FromSoftware's owner) <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">Earnings Report for Q3 2025/26</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-owner-reiterates-duskbloods-is-still-coming-this-year-exclusive-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), and both are still aiming for a 2026 release window. Unfortunately, responses in the report are pretty vague, but at least both games are still alive, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytDE5HpSoUj-c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbmqtokg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>When asked about a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Kadokawa merely states that "we have yet to announce a specific release date", but the question does wonder whether the game is included in the fiscal year's outlook, which Kadokawa "[has] not disclosed". So maybe don't expect it in the next month.</p>
<p>It's a similar story for The Duskbloods, where Kadokawa again says it hasn't announced "a specific release date". The report does confirm that it'll be sold on a joint basis with Nintendo "with sales responsibilities divided by region" and reiterates that the game will be a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>

<p>So, that's all we're getting for now, it seems. We'll likely just have to wait until the next big Nintendo Direct to hear <em>something</em>. And even then, it isn't a guarantee.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was actually meant to come out in 2025; as a port of the critically-acclaimed open world RPG, it'll include a few brand new jobs and includes the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Early hands-on reports at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">were pretty negative</a> regarding the state of the port, but fans and critics have come away <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/heres-another-look-at-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2">a bit happier with later builds</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've heard or seen next to nothing of The Duskbloods since its reveal, besides a brief little clip at The Game Awards last year and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-duskbloods-could-be-fromsoftwares-most-ambitious-game-yet-according-to-leak">a little leaker tidbit</a> which claims the game contains "many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of". We know it's a PvPvE game where you pick a vampire-like character and customise them in order to go out and fight others online, and... that's about it.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're looking forward to seeing more of them this year, hopefully.</p>

            <guid>1433770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><p>The VR industry has been on edge since Meta’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html">massive job cuts</a> earlier this year: One exec <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7419479403338063872/?originTrackingId=CeYxewxGYg9OrLSe80rfkA%3D%3D">called</a> the layoff announcements “one of VR’s darkest weeks.” There’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/metas-reality-labs-cuts-sparked-fears-of-a-vr-winter.html">talk of a VR winter</a>, and multiple VR studios have conducted <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/pistol-whip-developer-cloudhead-lays-off-70-percent-of-staff/">significant</a> <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/walkabout-mini-golf-layoffs/">layoffs</a> of their own.</p><p>For <em>Gorilla Tag</em> maker Another Axiom, however, it’s monkey — or monke, as they’d say — business as usual. The <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/891919991406810/">most popular</a> game on Meta’s Quest VR headset reached a new audience high this past weekend, when 119,000 players joined its five-year anniversary event in-game at the same time.</p><p>“We broke the world record, as we understand it, of concurrent players in VR,” says Another Axiom chief marketing officer Jake Zim. (Social VR app VRChat boasted <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/vrchat-nye-user-record/">150,000</a> concurrent users over New Year’s, but that number included people who accessed its 3D worlds on flat screens).</p><p>It’s not just special events: <em>Gorilla Tag </em>attracts up to a million VR users every day. Most of them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gorilla-tag-became-a-generational-obsession-and-conquered-vr/1100-6526437/">are Gen Alpha</a>, and they all battle each other in chaotic games of tag, powered by its unique style of arm-swinging locomotion. The free-to-play game frequently leads the <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/258035155854818">bestseller charts</a> of Meta’s Quest store. The game’s characters, known as monkes, have become so popular that Another Axiom regularly sells out of plush toys; total merch sales have reached close to $10 million, according to Zim.</p><p>“The fandom is bigger than just VR,” Zim tells me.</p><p>That’s why Another Axiom now has plans to expand beyond headsets: The company is working on a mobile game, a live event, and even a TV show. “We believe that the lore and the world of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> can tell so many stories,” Zim says.</p><p>Of course, there is a flip side to those planned expansion moves: Five years in, and with no bigger titles to catch up to, execs at Another Axiom are acutely aware that there may be a ceiling to VR, and that Meta’s cutbacks are clouding the medium’s future. “VR as an ecosystem is very challenged,” Zim admits. “With all the changes at Meta, this is a transition moment at best for VR.”</p><p>A transition moment that arguably caught Meta itself by surprise. For years, the company bet on gaming, fitness, and social VR to take headsets mainstream. Some of those efforts arguably worked: Meta sold <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-sales-20-million-retention-struggles/">millions of headsets</a>. The Meta-owned VR rhythm game <em>Beat Saber</em> <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/beat-saber-255-million-revenue/">surpassed $250 million</a> in revenue in 2022, and several other VR games, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/gorilla-tag-revenue-vr-success-another-axiom/">including <em>Gorilla Tag</em></a>, have since seen their revenue numbers top $100 million (“We’re significantly beyond that,” Zim tells me without providing further details).</p><p>But Meta’s bet on its Horizon Worlds metaverse arguably fell flat, and many AAA VR games have seen their audiences dwindle, leading Meta to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861420/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-vr-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-armature">close several internal VR studios</a>. Instead, VR has seen a massive influx of younger players who prefer chaotic free-to-play titles over polished and more expensive single-player games. And while many of these younger players <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/state-of-vr-2025-meta-cuts-quest-sales">have picked up Meta’s entry-level Quest 3S headset</a>, overall audience growth has happened “less quickly than we had hoped,” as Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a href="https://sources.news/p/why-meta-did-its-big-metaverse-layoffs">recently told Alex Heath</a>.</p><p>All of this has led to significant changes even beyond last month’s layoffs. Meta is shifting some of its massive Reality Labs spending toward AR and wearables and has reportedly <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-delaying-ultralight-headset-starting-work-on-quest-4/">delayed a lightweight headset</a> optimized for video viewing. Third-party headsets from Lenovo and Asus <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/">have been canceled</a>, and Horizon Worlds development resources are being redirected toward mobile gaming.</p><p>Zim would still like to believe that there is a silver lining to all of this. “Pulling back on [Horizon Worlds] and allowing what essentially is an indie, third-party app market to exist is a good thing,” he says. At the same time, he knows that a lack of cash infusion from Meta could lead to a talent drain. And if the company decided to not release any subsidized, affordable headsets in the future, it could further hamper the VR industry.</p><p>“2026 is this bridge year,” Zim tells me. “It’s not just [about] surviving, but figuring out how to speak directly to your audience, and put your audience into places that make sense for a business.”</p><p>For Another Axiom, that also means looking beyond the headset. The company hired former Scopely executive Austin Ashcraft as its GM of mobile last year, with Zim telling me that “getting onto platforms that are not VR is a massively strategic, important thing for us to do.” Those efforts may not stop at mobile. “We’ve been working on a variety of different, unique versions of the game that really hold the IP and what’s valuable about it sacred, but put it into formats and on media where it’s going to make sense,” he says.</p><p>Last summer, Another Axiom also hired Michael Vogel, who previously worked on animated shows like <em>My Little Pony</em> and <em>Strawberry Shortcake</em> at Hasbro and WildBrain. “We will make a TV show,” Zim confirms. “We are working on that.” He declined to share further details, but added that the company has been producing its own in-house web shows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_GorillaTagVR">for YouTube</a> for some time. “We’re getting tens of millions of views on our owned-and-operated channel,” he says.</p><p>Another Axiom is also experimenting with new business models, and launched a subscription for superfans this month. And finally, the company is going ahead with plans to hold its own real-world event dubbed Gorillacon — something Zim <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakezim_what-ifand-im-just-dreaming-out-loud-activity-7425344756332847104--Wb7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAcdcBuvSnY381oPoJdqGqUnAWoJeDkTo">cheekily teased as a possibility</a> on LinkedIn a few days ago.</p><p>“We knew the fans wanted it,” he says. “It’s going to happen.”</p><p>Zim again declined to share additional details — but if you’ve ever spent any time inside the chaotic world of <em>Gorilla Tag</em>, you’ll know that it’s probably going to be bananas.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/column/877473/gorilla-tag-vr-winter-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The fine frigate which serves as the featured image for this article is called the Stately Gunwale. That's not a name I, the boat's creator, gave it. It's a name ShipShaper's demo automatically assigned my vessel when I picked the set of colours I wished it to be painted. Quite frankly, I doubt I could have dreamed up a more fitting moniker for my deliberate attempt to fling something funky onto the high seas.</p>

<p>ShipShaper's the latest creation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-falconeer-review">The Falconeer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulwark-falconeer-chronicles-review">Bulwark</a> developer Tomas Sala, who describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve always loved ships and boats, perhaps it's the idea of going off to explore or an enduring fascination with the ocean. But I love ships. Over the last years I've known that ships would be at the centre of any Falconeer/Bulwark follow up, and what started out as a little folly made for Bulwark has grown into its own thing. ShipShaper is a small, explorative shipbuilder I made for the simple pleasure of shaping boats and ships. You pull, push, and drag forms into place, creating everything from humble fishing vessels to tall ships, ironclads, and early dreadnoughts. There’s no grid, no ‘meta’, and no right answer. Just shapes, balance, and the slow satisfaction of something coming together.</blockquote>
<p>Starting off with a small, bare template, you stretch and bend you boat into whatever shape you like. I stuck a big hump in the middle of the deck, because that's practical, then peppered masts, exhausts, and gun turrets about with reckless abandon. The engine cover is wedged halfway through the hull, and the sides are stocked with protruding galley oars which don't touch the water and cannons pointed at impractical angles. An anchor and some flaps round out a ship that should fare well at sea, when its prow isn't jutting underwater.</p><p>Once you've built the thing, you can snap some screenshots of it in a waterborne diorama. Sala has teased that "the full game will come with an open creative license to use the ships you create in any way you want for your own game development, boardgame or modding venture". You'll also be able 3D print your ship or import into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a>.</p>
<p>It's well worth spending at least five minutes playing around with ShipShaper, which doesn't have a release date as of writing. You can find its demo and wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4339280/ShipShaper/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Live-Service Death Spiral Is A Bleak One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192</link>
            <guid>1433752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Who remembers<a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661"><em> Spectre Divide</em></a>? It was a 2024 tactical first-person multiplayer shooter with an eye-catching visual style and a novel gameplay hook: you could swap between clones during matches as you hunted enemies and defended objectives. It came out around the same time as <em>Concord</em> and briefly seemed like an antidote to its excesses and shortcomings. Instead, it just failed more slowly and less spectacularly.</p> <p>It was made by Mountaintop Studios, which was founded in 2020 by ex-Oculus guys Nate Mitchell and Matt Hansen, who had the ears of investors. Seizing on gaming’s boom during the early pandemic, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/mountaintop-studios-30m-funding-shoud-zedd/">they turned $5.5 million in seed money into a $30 million early funding round</a>. They continued raising tens of millions as the game approached launch and tried to make a splash with contributions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0wXIu-HUq0">high-profile streamers like Shroud</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Spectre Divide</em> came out in September 2024 and peaked at over 30,000 concurrents on Steam, only to instantly begin its long and painful descent. A barrage of complaints about server issues and latency immediately tanked the Steam rating, followed by frustrations over matchmaking fairness and the lack of common features like a battle pass. It was a free-to-play game, so the barrier to entry was low, but some cosmetic bundles were absurdly overpriced.</p> <p>“That fucking killed us,” Hansen <a href="https://80.lv/articles/nate-mitchell-and-matt-hansen-on-the-death-of-spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios">told <em>80.lv</em></a> last year. “It killed our early momentum, which is critical for any new game.” By they time they addressed all of the early problems, the player counts were too low on PC to get fast and fair matchmaking, let alone generate meaningful post-launch revenue to keep the game afloat. Mountaintop pivoted to releasing a console version as soon as possible but it was already too late. <em>Spectre Divide</em> was in a death spiral.</p>

 <h2>The dead game death sentence</h2> <p>It made a bad first impression, with intrigue over the innovative take on what was essentially <em>Counter-Strike</em> meets <em>Valorant</em> in a bubblegum wrapper overshadowed by review-bombing over legitimate but temporary issues. Most players quickly popped back to their existing online games of choice. Anyone new who came along found a much slower, more lopsided matchmaking pool to introduce them to the game.</p>

 <p>Who wants to be caught buying a ticket for the Titanic after it’s already hit the iceberg? Who wants to be seen eating at a restaurant that’s almost entirely empty, no matter how good their tacos or smash burger are? A month after launch,<em> Spectre Divide</em> had a peak concurrent count of just under 3,000 players and was already battling the “dead game” stench wafting around its subreddit and Steam review comments.</p> <p>“The player count is such a self-fulfilling prophecy in and of itself,” Mitchell told me at the time. He called Steam concurrents the new Metacritic scores, a metric to batter games around with in service of competing agendas and narratives. “If people see the player count going up, then their articles get written about it, and then people come in, if it’s going down, people write articles, they’re like, this game’s not going to be around so I’m not going to invest my time in it. And it’s such a tough thing. I don’t think we expected that [back when we started development].”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000668229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668229">Mountaintop Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>He continued, “‘Dead game’ is not the most constructive feedback. So I much prefer when someone writes online, ‘Hey, the gunplay is not for me, and here’s why, and here’s how I think they should change it.’ But ultimately, it’s okay, you know, it’s on us…we deserve some of those, you know, sort of dead game memes at the end of the day.” In hindsight a year later, Hansen told <em>80.lv</em>, “Some players were saying it was a dead game within one day of release but we always felt like we were one update away from turning things around.”</p> <p>The Mountaintop founders have tried to Monday-morning-quarterback what might have turned things around for <em>Spectre Divide</em>. Delaying development to launch in a better place? Saving the marketing and media blitz for day-one instead of a closed beta? Mountaintop took a $65 million shot and missed. Some players looked at <em>Spectre Divide</em> and immediately felt it was destined to fail. Even months after the game shut down in early 2025, Mitchell believed that wasn’t the case. “In a parallel universe where we didn’t have the server issues, where the community wasn’t frustrated with our early pricing that rankled people, where maybe we had a bit more money for marketing, we could have gotten the critical mass going,” he said.</p> <p>I’m sure all of these questions are similar to the ones currently facing Wildlight Entertainment’s developers, the majority of whom <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">were laid off</a> this week, less than a month after <em>Highguard</em>‘s launch. When online multiplayer projects get such a small window to make their mark and find a foothold in an ever more competitive landscape that’s already crowded with too many games, how can you not begin to second-guess every little choice, from where to allocate resources early in development to how many heroes and modes to debut at launch?</p>

 <h2><em>Highguard</em>‘s race against time</h2> <p>Would deciding against revealing <em>Highguard</em> at the Game Awards 2025 have saved it weeks and weeks of bad online buzz, or would it have just made it that much harder to get anyone to pay attention once the game was out? Would a 5v5 mode on day one have kept more players around than the more boring 3v3 it started with? Would better performance on PC for less powerful gaming rigs have spared <em>Highguard</em> an immediate onslaught of negative drive-by Steam reviews? Would pitching its launch as an open beta or early access period have lowered the expectations it got graded against?</p> <p>No one knows the answers to these questions, or whether magically knowing them would matter in the scheme of a game that, at the end of the day, many agree can be interesting and fun but just isn’t as fully baked as its mountain of competition, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Deathlock</em> to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. What has become increasingly clear, however, is that once caught in a live-service death spiral, you need more than good ideas and some extra runway to escape it.</p>

 <p>It seems absurd to launch a multiplayer game and lay most of its creators off before the one-month anniversary, but short of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it’s hard to imagine momentum ever meaningfully shifting back in a game like <em>Highguard</em>‘s favor. Comeback stories like those around <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> are still extremely rare in the live-service space. When it works, it’s usually because you have massive publishers with huge franchises on the line–<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Fallout 76</em>–and even then it takes tons of money, years of scrambling, and more than a little luck to pull off a miracle.</p> <p>Most multiplayer games have none of those things, and sometimes even when they check all the boxes it’s still not enough. Wildlight wanted to create a game that “people love and [that] becomes a part of them,” studio head and game director Chad Grenier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> a week before<em> Highguard</em>‘s launch. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter. What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.” It might have mattered most, but it didn’t matter enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Noir was one of the surprise fan favorites from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-beyond-the-spiderverse-release-date-images-1851774004"><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span>. The actor used his Massive Talent and put on one of the more memorable performances in a movie full of them, even though he didn’t have as much screentime as Miles, Gwen, and Peter. The idea of a broody, monochromatic detective Spider-Man was a new concept to some fans, but Spider-Man Noir was introduced long before he showed up in the multiversal animated movies. Now, he’s getting his own live-action show, but not as Peter Parker; instead as Ben Reilly, and that name carries a lot more questions than answers. We have the first trailer for the series, and it looks pretty cool.</span></p> <p><span>The eight-episode series stars Cage as an older version of Spider-Man who is a detective in New York during the 1930s. Ben is a bit of a burnout, which is refreshing after every Spider-Man being a standup citizen who saves the day because it’s right. But if you’re unfamiliar with Ben, this might not be the best introduction to him, as Cage’s character seems to be a composite character of Spider-Man Noir and the Scarlet Spider. In the comics, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker who has taken on different roles and aliases as the years have gone on. It’s unclear if naming Cage’s character Ben is a nod to another </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>story, or if it’s going to actually play into some twist down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Spider-Noir </span></i><span>will premiere on Amazon on May 27, and will be available in both color and black-and-white to capture the character and comic’s original black-and-white color scheme. Based on the views of the YouTube trailers, it looks like folks might be gravitating toward the monochromatic filter. That feels fitting.</span></p>  <p><span>Though it’s being released on Amazon, this show is technically part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><span>Sony’s extended </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>universe</span></a><span>, which has mostly bombed with absolute stinkers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337"><i><span>Madame Web</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-jared-leto-movie-theaters-marvel-sony-bom-1849024089"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. The </span><i><span>Venom </span></i><span>movies were kind of okay, sometimes. Really, </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>is the best thing Sony has done as it’s held onto the movie license, other than partnering with Marvel to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leaks-avengers-doomsday-2000654144"><span>bring Peter Parker to the MCU</span></a><span>, and hopefully some of the brilliance of those animated movies has rubbed off on </span><i><span>Spider-Noir</span></i><span>. If not, Cage is usually still worth tuning in for, just to see what he does with bad material.</span></p>

            <p>
Yet more evidence pointing to the existence of Ubisoft's much-rumoured but still doggedly unannounced Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has surfaced, this time in the form of an official art book currently set to release this March.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Black Flag remake first surfaced in 2023, when it was claimed the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">getting the do-over treatment from Skull and Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore</a>. At the time, the project was said to still be "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Since then, evidence of the remake's existence has continued to mount, despite Ubisoft's persistent silence. Last year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted the remake was close to release, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then, in December, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">briefly appeared on the PEGI website</a>, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. But it didn't stop there; January saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">leak of a suspiciously timed Assassin's Creed Black Flag collectible figurine</a> featuring Kenway sat on a treasure chest, seemingly corroborating earlier word from statue maker PureArts that something Black Flag-y was "going on". We've also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">Black Flag sea shanties officially uploaded to YouTube</a>, later blamed on "technical issues", and even a sort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">acknowledgment-adjancet meme post</a> from Ubisoft's social media team.
</p><p>
And now, a Black Flag art book can be tossed onto the growing evidence pile. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">spotted by IGN</a>, the tome (listed under the name Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster - Art Book) was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=05aB1hBAYymJ9H38fEE0g5D">recently added to Amazon UK</a> with a recommended retail price of £39.99 - currently £29.95 - and a release date of 24th March, 2026. Titan, a company that's released numerous officially licensed Assassin's Creed art books over the years, is listed as the publisher.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the Black Flag art book is legit, its listed release would coincide with the original launch window for Ubisoft's conspicuous, and much-discussed, "unannounced game" - a title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">widely believed to be the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>. However, as part of a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" announced in January, the company pushed the title - alongside six other unspecified games - into its next financial year, starting April 2026, to "ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met".
</p>
<p>
That shakeup also saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">cancellation of seven games</a> - including Ubisoft's troubled and long-in-the-works Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - alongside the closure of two studios, the restructuring of several more, and the implementation of return-to-office mandates. This week, 1,200 Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">began a three-day strike</a> in response to the company's recent moves.

			<p>FromSoftware's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> was a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">standout reveal</strong> during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event</strong></a>, though its continued absence from the spotlight has led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">speculation regarding its launch timeline</strong>. Despite the title not appearing during this month's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, the project <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains on track to release before the end of the year.</strong></p>



<p>Kadokawa, FromSoftware's parent company, reiterated this window today in its <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Q3 fiscal year earnings report</strong></a>, confirming a generic <strong>2026</strong> schedule for the title.</p>



<p> In the report, Kadokawa also addressed the game's platform status, stating it will<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2".</em> While this confirms exclusivity for now, it likely refers to the game’s status at launch. Given the broader industry trend of moving away from permanent console exclusives, it would be <strong>a significant shift</strong> if <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> did not eventually see a PC release, at the very least.</p>



<p>The high level of anticipation surrounding <em>The Duskbloods</em> is understandable, especially following how <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em></strong> evolved the studio's formula with its roguelike-meets-soulslike co-op mechanics in 2025.</p>



<p>Reports suggest that <em>The Duskbloods</em> will take things a step further. The game has been in development since before <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>'s marketing began, making it <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">one of the studio's longest development cycles</a></strong> to date, and focuses on innovative gameplay features the studio is reportedly very proud of. As such, players are eager to see the game and these systems in action. Hopefully, it will be soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryan Burns, the developer behind psychological horror game <em>The Oily Depths</em>, has slashed the game's price permanently in response to player feedback, so now's your chance to get it much, much cheaper.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3113030/view/542256414786060359" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's Steam page, Burns says he's been "listening closely" to player feedback following the release of <em>The Oily Depths</em>, which happened earlier this week.</p><p>After reviewing player comments and "taking a hard look at where the game stands right now", Burns decided to cut <em>The Oily Depths</em>' price from $8 down to just $3. That's a price cut of over 60%, and it's not a temporary sale, either; that's a permanent cut.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Burns says he wants every player to feel as though "they got a great value out of their experience" with <em>The Oily Depths</em>, and that he believes the new price "better reflects the scope and length of the game".</p><p>If you did buy <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its original price, Burns says that given the game's short length, you should still be within the Steam refund window, so you can ask for a refund "and repurchase at the new price if you'd like".</p><p>As a quick reminder, Steam refunds are offered to players with fewer than two hours' playtime in a game, as long as they've owned that game for less than two weeks. Since <em>The Oily Depths </em>came out on February 9th, the latter, at least, applies to every player right now.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>The Oily Depths </em>is, it's a short horror adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d7b5677-68b0-4a7b-8a7c-8bf4bc8cb7eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Blizzard staffer Ryan Burns</a>, and it combines a lo-fi, chunky art style with gameplay that revolves around examining and maintaining machines abord a deep-sea submarine.</p>
