            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/atomic-mass-games-gives-away-canceled-star-wars-x-wing-ship-pack-cards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game just got some new content. It's not a new edition or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deleted-fantasy-flight-games-custom-tools-files-restored-by-fans" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly uncovered custom scenarios</a>, but a set of ship cards from a canceled ship pack. And it is available to everyone for free.</p>

<p>According to a social media <a href="https://x.com/atomicmassgames/status/1832106250911494539">post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Atomic Mass Games decided to release cards for the announced, then canceled, <em>Star Wars X-Wing TIE Phantom </em>and<em> Alpha Class Starwing</em> ship packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8t8riSaG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=5arTEUV5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The cards are available on Atomic Mass Games' <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-docs/">website</a> as a print-and-play PDF. In addition, the game's points document has been updated to include the new ships.</p>
<p>Like all <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> ship packs, the cards in <em>TIE Phantom</em> and <em>Alpha Class Starwing </em>contain a mix of tactics, weapons, pilot cards, and spaceship artwork courtesy of Timothy Ben Zweifel, Matt Bradbury, Mark Molnar, and Anthony Deville.</p>
<p>This is the first piece of new content for <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> since April 2022. The original game was released in 2012 by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2018, the game received <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a second edition</a>.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game has had 12 waves of expansions. These expansions have added multiple ships and factions from across the Star Wars franchise, including the CIS and Old Republic from the prequel trilogy and the New Republic and First Order from the sequel trilogy.</p>

These include <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-early-2021-expansions-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Legion</em></a>, and <em>Star Wars Armada</em>. This past June, Atomic Mass Games announced they were <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/update-on-star-wars-x-wing-and-star-wars-armada/">stopping development</a> on both <em>X-Wing</em> and <em>Armada</em>.</p>
<p>Atomic Mass Games has stopped all active development on both miniature games but continues to support the community through tournaments and organized play events.</p>
<p>If you want some new content in your <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> skirmishes, these print-and-play ship cards may do the trick. As for miniature models, there's always the option of DIY 3D printing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr Disrespect Returns to Streaming to Explain His Side of The Story]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-returns-to-streaming-to-explain-his-side-of-the-story.974472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dr Disrespect appeared on camera for the first time since June to address the recent allegations of ‘minor messaging’ that were levelled against him on social media. It has been one of the most storied topics in the content creation world in the last couple of months, ever since former Twitch employees came forward with their claims.</p>



<p>In the opening 20 minutes of his return stream, Dr Disrespect blasted Twitch, confirmed that he’s still not denying what he did, and attempted to set the story straight from his perspective, all in front of 240,000 viewers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-was-handled-years-ago">‘This Was Handled Years Ago’</h2>



<p>In his first stream in more than two months, Dr Disrespect kicked off by giving an expansive account of his side of the story. As the reports go, Dr Disrespect messaged a minor on Twitch in 2017 (which he has admitted to doing), and in 2020, this was discovered and used as ‘fuel’ to get him kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>That’s the abbreviated version of this lengthy debacle.</p>



<p>Per Dr Disrespect’s to clear things up, things turned sour for him and Twitch when in 2019 he was assigned a partner manager he instantly failed to work well with. Shortly after, a grudge was formed and the ‘partner manager’ started probing into Dr Disrespect’s Whispers – which was Twitch’s on-platform private messaging service.</p>



<p>Following a review by the Trust and Safety team at Twitch, no wrongdoing was found, but this unnamed partner manager persisted and used a friend to force the messages onto the ‘Law Enforcement Team’ at Twitch. Again, no wrongdoing was found, despite it having an ‘investment’ from a company director.</p>



<p>This process reportedly included reviews by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, amongst others, and again, no illegal actions were discovered, and therefore, nothing was taken any further. Dr Disrespect also claimed that the victim in question had no interest in escalating the situation to Twitch, and at no point were Dr Disrespect <strong>or </strong>the victim interviewed.</p>



<p>Hunter clipped the full segment below:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dr Disrespect's full 20 minute response after returning to stream. He says: </p><p>– He was not found guilty of anything <br>– The individual did not want to file a report but Twitch pushed them to<br>– His old Twitch partner manager was targeting him and personally escalated messages to… <a href="https://t.co/hr7YyE4uhV">pic.twitter.com/hr7YyE4uhV</a></p></div>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href="https://twitter.com/HUN2R/status/1832131401044414870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>On stream, Dr Disrespect said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has affected us on so many levels – back in 2020, and now in 2024. And Cody Connors, I just have to say it again… Why would you do this? Like I said, this was handled professionally years ago, no wrongdoing. But because of you, Cody, we just lost — unfortunately, we had to lay off people from Midnight Society, because of you, Cody.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a reference to the individual who ignited this situation back in June with posts on social media.</p>



<p>After that, he said again:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For all you Doc haters, I’m sure you’ll jsut dissect all of this and still find a way to publically criticise me, but do what you need to do. But this isn’t for you. This is for my team today, my community, and my friends that have supported me. And I’m not denying the exchange of Whispers, Champs.</p>



<p>I’m not denying that to all of you out there, it looks bad. I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was innappropriate, and if it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Connors, or the public is claiming that I did.</p>



<p>That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many were quick to state that Dr Disrespect ‘has no receipts’ for much of this, but throughout this entire event, there has also been nothing from those condemning him to verify his wrongdoing. He has copped to it and held his hands up, and now he’s trying to do some damage control and claw back his career.</p>



<p>He explained that he’s eligible to apply for monetisation on YouTube on September 25, and if he lands it, then it just might remain business as usual for the streamer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme is the chip inside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> — and in early 2025, AMD will announce its successor, the Z2 Extreme, for future PC gaming handhelds. </p><p>That’s the word <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-confirms-z2-extreme/">from <em>Digital Trends</em>’ Jacob Roach</a>, who heard AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh say it’s targeting a 2025 release on an IFA stage in Berlin; I just confirmed with AMD spokesperson Stacy MacDiarmid that the company plans to announce it in early 2025, though AMD’s declining to say any more about it today. </p><p>The only other things we’ve heard: AMD says it’s working with multiple partners, so the chip may already be in handheld makers’ hands. And it’s probably based on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24198605/amd-ryzen-ai-strix-point-vs-apple-intel-qualcomm-event">AMD’s Strix Point</a>; so say Jez Corden’s sources <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/amd-confirms-z2-extreme-chip-aims-to-boost-pc-gaming-handheld-battery-life-by-over-300">over at <em>Windows Central</em></a>. </p><p>AMD’s Huynh also reportedly mentioned he wants to play games like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> for three hours on a handheld instead of the current 45 minutes, but it’s not clear whether that was just an anecdote or a hint at what a Strix-based Z2 Extreme can do. </p><p>I’m not yet sure how optimistic to be about Strix quite yet; AMD touted the increased performance of Zen 5 in its Strix Point laptop architecture briefings, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24198605/amd-ryzen-ai-strix-point-vs-apple-intel-qualcomm-event#:~:text=Next%2Dto%2Dno%20mentions%20of%20battery%20life">it didn’t say a word about increased battery life</a>. </p><p>While a performance improvement can sometimes turn into a battery life improvement by changing a chip to that end, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23696722/amd-ryzen-z1-z1-extreme-rog-ally">AMD’s original Z1 Extreme</a> was largely just a tweaked version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23709251/amd-ryzen-7040-u-apple-m2-intel-laptop-cpu-apu">Ryzen 7840U laptop chip</a>, one that really needed lots of electricity to thrive. </p><p>Handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go can turbo up to 40 or 50 watts of total system drain to play games that barely run on the Steam Deck, but that means they fully drain their batteries in under an hour. They couldn’t beat the Steam Deck’s semi-custom chip at 15 watts or get anywhere near as much battery life in less demanding titles.</p><p>Eventually, the AMD ROG Ally X brute-forced its way to vastly better battery life by doubling the size of the pack inside. But maybe AMD takes a different route and makes the Z2 Extreme a bespoke handheld chip? That’d be exciting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone above nine years old will be able to utilize this feature and Party will launch first with the ability for players to text each other in the app. Later in the year, voice will be added for those who are phone-verified users aged 13 or older.</p><p>Party will work both inside and outside of Roblox and, early next year, the Roblox team will add an API that will let developers improve the Party system by letting them teleport players to the same starting point, put them in a private lobby, and even pre-pair them onto the same team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/the-flow-of-hosting-a-party-with-friends-1725636860526.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another way Roblox is attempting to bring people together is by rebranding its Roblox Groups to Roblox Communities. These spaces will be a place for players to participate in Forums to share feedback on their experiences, talk about their favorite games and moments, and report issues that arise.</p><p>Music is one more area Roblox is looking to expand into, as the team will be making new ways for players to discover music and connect with artists beyond just listening to the songs included in a Roblo experience. Such platform features as What's Playing and Music Charts will be added and an integration with the music distribution service DistroKid will be the simple way artists can upload their work or find music to include in their projects. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/music-charts-desktop-view-1725637415607.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Creator Affiliate Program and transparent algorithms</h2><p>Roblox has announced a Creator Affiliate Program that will reward developers who can bring new users into the platform. Creators will be able to share a unique link that will earn them money when someone uses it to sign up and purchase Robux. Creators will earn a share of the revenue the person "generates from their Robux purchases" for the first six months. </p><p>Applications are open now for the first version of this program — which will enable creators to earn up to 50% on qualified purchases — and the team anticipates all eligible creators will be able to utilize the program by the middle of 2025.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/23-1725637111974.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Creators will also be happy to know the Roblox team is improving the way users find their content. Today's Picks on the homepage and on Marketplace will highlight even more experiences, and impressions on sponsored ads on Roblox's homepage have increased from 1.6% in March 2024 to over 8% in June 2024.</p><p>Furthermore, the team promises "open and transparent insight into search and discovery on Roblox." This means creators will have a better idea on what the team values and how they can craft their experiences to become as visible as possible.</p><h2>AI and scaling Roblox to all devices</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/capture-1725637021622.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The team at Roblox wants the platform to run its best on as many devices as possible, and a new technology called Harmony aims to optimize the game to achieve this goal. Harmony includes client-side balancing and optimizations of CPU, GPU, and RAM. In the future, this will extend into Roblox-supported architecture for "server authority for competitive games."</p><p>AI, which has already been a part of Roblox for some time with Assistant, Texture Generator, and Avatar Auto Setup, will be taken to the next level with a new incubation project that was launched just a few months ago. This 3D foundational model will be open source and multimodal and will "power 3D generation through text, video, and 3D prompts." </p><p>The goal is to let devs create their dreams in whichever style they prefer - be it photorealistic, anime, low-poly, or steampunk - and generate objects and scenes to match. Devs will even be able to have AI create an entire world and give the AI feedback to finetune it to their liking.</p><p>Additionally, Roblox will soon make it possible for devs to host a high-performance, 100-player open world, sports, or battle royale-type game and have it run on 2GB RAM devices. </p><h2>Helping Creators Build Their Businesses</h2><p>Alongside helping devs create newer and even more ambitious projects, the Roblox team is working on helping these same creators earn more money for their hard work. In the "coming months," there will be a new option to optimize in-experience pricing. This new tool will run price tests and recommend the "most attractive pricing strategy." There will also be testing done for regional pricing recomendations. </p><p>Early next year, creators will be able to sell physical merchandise from within their experiences, and the team at Roblox will be parterning with various e-commerce platforms like Shopify to make this a smooth and easy process.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/paid-access-pricing-1725636903936.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Lastly, devs will be able to price their paid access experiences in real currency value on desktop and earn an even higher revenue share than before. This means experiences selling at $9.99, $29.99, and $49.99 will get a 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue share, respectively. This change will roll out later this year for desktop and other devices will hopefully get this feature in the future.</p><p><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/once-human-mobile-testing-begins-september-19-dlss-3-support-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once Human's mobile testing will officially begin on September 19, 2024, with players on both iOS and Android devices able to play the game. Those in North America, Europe, Japan, and South Korea will be able to play the game on a smaller screen and provide feedback to the developers. In addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-qa-the-launch-was-successful-beyond-our-imagination/">the developers</a> have also announced that Once Human now has DLSS 3.0 support, which has helped to enhance the game's graphics.</p>
<p>To join the mobile testing for Once Human, players will need to download the version from the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>. The test starts on September 19 at 8 PM PDT / 11 PM EDT / 4 AM BST. However, the number of spaces for players is limited, so once the maximum number has been reached, the registration page will be closed. The developers have also stated that once the test is done, all data from the test will be wiped.</p>
<p>Once Human already had spectacular graphics, DLSS 3.0 provided a better visual experience for those with Nvidia RTX 40 series GPUs. DLSS 3.0 works by providing enhanced game performance while continuing to bolster graphical fidelity. This technology can double the game's frame rate while using the same graphic settings as before. This is especially beneficial for those who don't have a beefy setup and can provide a more immersive experience to those who are on lower-budget hardware.</p>
<p>The official Once Human YouTube channel posted a 45-second showcase to help players see what NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex have in store for them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human丨NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex are now available!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL2o5hJ03nI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to these two major news points, it has been announced that the Once Human Season 2 Battle Pass will launch on September 12, which includes some limited edition cosmetics for players to obtain. This includes the Night Time Rose cosmetic set, the Nightmare Cage backpack skin, the Dragon Dance weapon skin for the MPS7, and the Battle Station furniture pack. While these are available through the battle pass, new items will be added to the Shop on September 19 for players to purchase.</p>
<p>The items in the Shop include the Ethereal Feathers fashion set, the Cold Exuviate backpack skin, the Sad Blossom weapon skin for the MPS5, and the Combat Medic fashion set. These are paid items that players can obtain through the free-to-play game's store and Battle Pass.</p>
<p>There are two paid tracks on the Battle Pass, the essential track costing $9.99 and the premium track costing $23.99. Both tracks provide supplies and cosmetic items.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-is-too-much-nostalgia-and-too-little-substance.974421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-movie-review-cast-2024-new-1851642373<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nostalgia has been the driving force behind so many recently released movies, with sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes of films that we love from the past dominating theaters in the last several years. From <em>Ghostbusters</em> to <em>Indiana Jones</em>, <em>Scream</em> to <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>Twister</em> to <em>Deadpool</em>, It feels like now more than ever, we are desperate to rekindle the joy and laughter from pieces of popular culture’s past. Instead of simply watching the original movies, audiences yearn for a return to beloved characters and the unique worlds they inhabit, wondering what they would be like now.<br></p><p>But these nostalgic retreads face a difficult challenge: They must try to capture the spirit of the original (which usually can’t be done) or outshine it, while also adding something fresh and new. This can either surprisingly succeed or spectacularly fail—unfortunately, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> falls into the latter category. While there are glimmers of the macabre comedy that we’ve come to know and love from director Tim Burton, the majority of the sequel to the 1988 classic feels like you’re on some sort of demented carousel; it just keeps spinning past partial storylines, visual slapstick, and limited character development without ever digging into the emotional core.</p><h2 id="h146923"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Beetlejuice </em>but make it girl power</strong></h2><p>One of the best aspects of the sequel is that it focuses on three generations of Deetz women. Winona Ryder, who starred in the original film, artfully translates Lydia Deetz’s pensiveness to middle age. While she still sports her signature choppy hairstyle and long, black clothing, her character has evolved into someone far more anxious and distant than the young woman we once knew. She pops pills and has trouble connecting with her daughter, Astrid (Jenna Ortega). Lydia, now a psychic, hosts a television series, using her abilities to communicate with the ghosts that she’s able to see. But lately she’s been haunted by unsettling visions of her teenage demon, Betelgeuse. Lydia has lost a lot of the fire she had as a teen, allowing her to be taken advantage of by her smarmy producer and boyfriend, played by Justin Theroux. </p><p>Lydia’s shift from photographer to television star feels slightly out of character because she was always such a loner and quiet presence. But people change, especially decades after being a 16-year-old. It also allows for a cheeky meta commentary that sees Astrid annoyed to be living in her mother’s shadow and wanting to carve out her own story.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-burton-movies-ranked-beetlejuice-big-fish-halloween-1851637754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-burton-movies-ranked-beetlejuice-big-fish-halloween-1851637754">We Ranked Every Tim Burton Movie, Now Including <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>, From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>Jenna Ortega, with glum expressions, downward-turned mouth, and large eyes, seems like she was made in a Tim Burton factory. As with her lead role in Burton’s series <em>Wednesday</em>, Jenna Ortega is the perfect fit for a new generation of angsty <em>Beetlejuice </em>oddballs. Echoing Lydia’s annoyance with stepmother Delia  in the first film, Astrid resents her mother’s psychic abilities and showbiz occupation. She idolizes her father who passed away and fought for important causes like environmentalism.<br></p><p>This dynamic makes her an easy target for Jeremy, a Dostoyevsky-loving teen who’s more than he initially appears. This all sounds like fodder for interesting tension and sharply-drawn characterization, but unlike past Tim Burton films that have a sentimentality as evocative as his visuals,<em> Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> mostly relies on exposition and hasty plot contrivances to move everything forward, making the stories feel rushed and superficial. We never stay with the characters long enough to attach to who they are and how they’re feeling. When Astrid ventures into the underworld and conveniently encounters her father, it leads to a family reunion that moves way too fast to have any emotional effect.<br></p><p>Catherine O’Hara returns as the melodramatic Delia, who has moved on from sculpture to multimedia art, which produces some hilarious moments like when she is filming herself trying to capture the perfect primal scream.<em> Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> shrewdly sidesteps actor Jeffrey Jones, who played Delia’s husband Charles in the original and whose career ended in a child pornography scandal, with the use of a stop-motion animation sequence to show how he died. The original’s stop-motion sandworms also return, preserving the 1988 film’s cartoony, old-school aesthetic, though ventures into CGI muddy the film’s visual language.</p><figure id="" data-id="7a4a6eb9437319863199429da24c4751" data-recommend-id="image://7a4a6eb9437319863199429da24c4751" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Beetlejuice looks smugly at the camera.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h146924"><a id=""></a><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice </em>binges nostalgia</h2><p>As the titular character, Michael Keaton is appropriately rambunctious and kooky, but he’s lost some of his bite. The film’s attempts at contemporary humor, which find it mocking therapy-speak and the focus on healing from trauma and addressing one’s inner child, just don’t sting as much as the barbs in the original. Betelgeuse is involved in a plot with a very underused Monica Bellucci as Delores—Betelgeuse’s ex-wife who is part Morticia Addams, part Sally from <em>A Nightmare Before Christmas</em> with a stapled-together body. She looks sexy and menacing while stalking him throughout the underworld, but has little else to do. Her threadbare story amounts to nothing except for a reason to re-stage the wedding scene at the end of the original <em>Beetlejuice </em>with Lydia’s blood-red dress.<br></p><p>Another new face is Willem Dafoe, who fits right into Tim Burton’s eccentric style as Wolf Jackson, an action star who approaches his afterlife cop duties with all the campy gusto he brought to his movie roles. Oddly enough, I got more laughs out of Wolf than I did Betelgeuse. Other jokes, like the painfully obvious, literal soul train and Astrid’s self-referential muttering of“I swear, the afterlife is so random,” weren’t cutting it, either.<br></p><p><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> is more comfortable cramming references to the first film than doing anything different. A child choir sings “Banana Boat (Day-O)” at Charles’ funeral; there’s no earthly reason for this, except to reference the infamous scene. I understand that this is a fantasy comedy, but the sacrifice of storytelling for obvious nostalgia bait was too much.</p><p>There’s another lip-syncing scene at the end of <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> (and really, how could there not be?) but Tim Burton was never going to be able to top the original’s calypso revelry set to Harry Belefonte. Richard Harris’ lengthy “MacArthur Park” is a delightfully peculiar choice, but it also doesn’t feel earned, just inserted just for the sake of having another musical number.</p><p>I might have rose-colored glasses on for the original <em>Beetlejuice</em>, which I grew up watching as a kid, but sitting through <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> felt like going to an amusement park as a grown-up: the rides are now worn and clunky and you just want to get off. <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> is all flashing lights and bright colors, but little substance. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Concord, Sony's floundering 5v5 hero shooter, has now officially gone offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC launch - its short life abruptly ending with an undignified "error" message.
</p>
<p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">unveiled last May</a> as part of former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">optimistically expansive push into live-service gaming</a>. Unfortunately for Sony and developer Firewalk Studios, Concord's launch this August failed to make much of an impact - player numbers were less-than-stellar, and subsequent reports claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only around 25,000 copies had been sold</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, it was a bit of a shock when Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">announced it was pulling the plug on Concord</a> earlier this week so soon after release, Firewalk admitting "our initial launch didn't land" and confirming Concord would be taken offline today. And its life - in its current guise, at least - is now officially at an end; servers went down a little before 7pm this evening in the UK, presenting players with nothing more than a terse "error" message and instructions on how to refund the game.

<p>
Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordGame/comments/1fal8r5/concord_servers_are_officially_closed/?rdt=39465">game's subreddit</a>, though, Concord's community team shared a more heartfelt message, writing, "On behalf of everyone at Firewalk, thank you for all of your support. We are deeply thankful for those of you who spent your time with us, made memories, and learned what it means to be a Freegunner." It also noted the game's Discord server will remain open, although changes will be made to "streamline the conversation".
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordGame/comments/1fakvvx/won_the_last_match_then_my_results_screen_errored/">Won the last match, then my results screen errored.

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
As to whether Concord still has a future, that remains unclear. Firewalk previously said it would "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options" following the game's closure, suggesting it might one day return in an overhauled form. Concord's demise won't, however, impact its appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-will-reportedly-remain-in-amazons-upcoming-secret-level-anthology-series-despite-recent-shutdown">recent report</a> - so there'll be one last opportunity to say goodbye.

Ubisoft has unveiled that there will be log-in rewards for XDefiant starting September 9 that can ultimately end up in players earning $9 in virtual currency for the FPS. Coincidentally, this takes place right after Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's second beta weekend ends.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1832103983324000392" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, the official XDefiant account shared that the game's celebrating the end of Season 1 with daily log-in giveaways. The gifts will be doled out to players who log in to the FPS, starting with 100 XCoins on September 9. The rewards will then basically flip-flop between weapon and battle-pass boosters back to XCoins until September 24--that day will feature both presents.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1832103983324000392" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It’s time to celebrate Season 1!<br>🎁Starts on 9/9 at 10 AM PT<br>🎉Resets daily at 10 AM PT<br>🎊 Ends on 9/25 at 6 AM PT<br>Just log-in each day and the reward will be added to your account.

                <p>Remedy recently announced that a coming update for Alan Wake will <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove</a> the classic David Bowie song Space Oddity from the game, replacing it with the original song Strange Moons, penned by Remedy composer Petri Alanko. However, it seems that this update will not affect Alan Wake Remastered, which came out in 2021.</p><p>Arguably one of Bowie's best-known songs, the galactic rock song that features the iconic line "ground control to Major Tom" originally played over Alan Wake's closing credits. Though we don't know what Strange Moons will sound like yet, composer Alanko <a href="https://x.com/Peppepappa/status/1831740963368108257" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X/Twitter</a> that a part of the song was originally included in an Alan Wake level that was cut prior to the game's final release.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Alan Wake Full Story Recap</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Music licenses often cause game developers to have to update or even delist their games years after release due to expiring legal contracts. Perhaps the best-known recent example is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spec-ops-the-line-delisting-reason-revealed-director-comments-on-removal/1100-6520743/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, which was delisted from Steam due to "several partnership licenses related to the game…expiring." While it's not clear if these are related to music licenses, it's a shame that one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of the early 2010s is no longer available for the next generations of players to enjoy. Alan Wake 2's latest DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-dlcs-genre-bending-trailer-reveals-surprise-launch-this-week/1100-6524028/">Night Springs</a>, released back in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Remedy recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-and-annapurna-strike-a-deal-to-expand-control-and-alan-wake-franchises/1100-6526191/" data-ref-id="1100-6526191">struck a deal</a> with Annapurna to co-finance and self-publish Control 2, and that may result in the production of films or TV shows based on the Control and Alan Wake franchises.</p>

That’s only because everybody I know has one and desperately wants a new console to replace their aging system. While you wait, why not boot up that relic and pick up a game from its massive library? Nintendo is currently discounting some of its titles as part of a blockbuster sale, and there are a range of diverse games to pick from depending on the mood you’re in or the genre you’re looking for. </p></div><div><p>This series remains the most unorthodox crossover in the world, but they are also some of the most brilliantly accessible tactics games too! Both games are also scored by Grant Kirkhope, a composer most known for his work on classics like <em>Donkey Kong 64 </em>and <em>Goldeneye 007</em>. The <em>Mario + Rabbids </em>games are exactly the kind of weird risks I wish more big publishers would take with their most famous properties. I don’t have a particular preference between <em>Sparks of Hope </em>and its predecessor, <em>Kingdom Battle</em>, but I’ll err on the side of the most recent title, which does away with some of the more rigid and conservative systems of the first to make for a wild strategy game.<strong> </strong>It’s also the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371">last game to feature Charles Martinet</a></span>, the longtime voice of Mario, as the character, if you’re the sentimental type. <strong>You can give Mario a gun by picking up <em>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope </em>for $19.79.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of maybe two Switch games I’ve managed to play this year, but it definitely started 2024 on a great note. I loved the PS2 games, but didn’t know at the time that they were reimaginings of a 2D platformer series that’d been around forever. Given how dormant the franchise was throughout the late ‘00s and all of the ‘10s, it was exciting to see it come back to life as this excellent Metroidvania that gave some hope to younger and older fans alike. <em>The Lost Crown </em>is a stunning return to form, complete with gorgeous visuals, a slick movement and combat system with depth if you look for it, and a confident puzzle game in spots too. It is also, crucially, a game that you can complete in the span of a weekend on your couch snuggled up with your favorite handheld. <strong>Hack-and-slash your way backwards and forwards in time with </strong><em><strong>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </strong></em><strong>for $24.</strong></p></div><div><p>Kotaku is home to a few <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/persona&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/persona"><em>Persona</em></a></span><em> </em>marks, so I have to recommend that you pick up the trio of games that are currently on sale on the Switch. The<em> Persona Collection</em> features <em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, and <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, meaning you’re getting something pretty close to the definitive versions of each of those titles for a more-than-fair price. <em>P3P</em>, despite its constraints, features the series’ only female protagonist, and <em>P4G </em>and <em>P5R </em>both contain new expanded final chapters that most fans love. Each one of those titles will cost you at least 50 hours to complete. The base version of <em>Persona 5 </em>alone took me 105 hours.<strong> For just $45, you too can experience the highs and lows of Japanese teenagedom while saving the world from destructive supernatural forces in the</strong><em><strong> Persona Collection.</strong></em></p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>is blowing the fuck up right now thanks to the meteoric success of <em>Monster Hunter World </em>and the anticipation that’s building for next year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span>. There’s a middle child between them that is often overlooked despite its excellence though, and that’s <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. Often viewed as a bit of a step back from the scope of <em>World</em>, <em>Rise </em>initially launched on the Switch, meaning it was largely designed for the hybrid console. To that end, it’s a much faster game than either of the titles that bookend it, which might make it more appealing for playing on the go, or from the comfort of your bed. <em>Sunbreak</em>, its lone expansion, is massive, and that’s without taking into consideration the number of additions made to the base game through title updates leading up to its release. <strong>You can grab the utterly massive </strong><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></em><strong>, as well as its expansion, for just $20.</strong></p></div><div><p>The Switch has earned a reputation as the party console. Many systems feature games that can be busted out during gatherings, but I don’t think many have the murderers’ row of titles that the Switch has. In terms of first-party games alone, it has <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, </em>several <em>Mario Party </em>titles, <em>Warioware: Move It! </em>and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, which is about what any real party even needs. If you’re having some difficulty getting people up and moving, or you just want to make everyone look ridiculous, <em>Just Dance </em>is the move. I love <em>Just Dance</em>, and I would play any incarnation, no matter how sober I am. You cannot put a price on the joy of drunkenly pulling three of your friends into a dance number set to the theme of <em>Tetris </em>and being the orange L-block that then gets lifted by the other dancers. <strong>However, you can put a great price on the deluxe edition of </strong><em><strong>Just Dance</strong></em><strong> 2024 which is going for $31.49. If you pick it up, you get four months of the </strong><em><strong>Just Dance+ </strong></em><strong>subscription, which gives you access to the entire catalog of dances through the years. </strong>You will not regret this choice.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pentiment-on-playstation-and-nintendo-switch-1851278458&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pentiment-on-playstation-and-nintendo-switch-1851278458"><em>Pentiment</em></a></span><em> </em>is my favorite game of 2022. It is one of the most moving stories I’ve ever experienced in one of the most artfully rendered worlds in the medium. The game’s protagonist, Andreas Maler, is never far from my thoughts, and neither is the wildly memorable cast that fills town of Tassing, where the game takes place. Set against the backdrop of a recent spree of murders, you are tasked with solving the mysteries plaguing the townsfolk and local abbey, all while interrogating your neighbors and close friends. <em>Pentiment</em> is developed by Obsidian, a studio best known for RPGs like <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, and this game keeps some of that alive within the trappings of a more straightforward adventure game to add some mechanical depth and further characterization to its nuanced story and cast. <em><strong>Pentiment</strong></em><strong> is a sterling example of what games </strong><em><strong>could </strong></em><strong>and should be, and it can be yours for $12.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 from developer CD Projekt Red had a challenging start when it was released in December 2020--the issues were so bad that Sony removed the game from sale entirely on the PlayStation Store. But the game rebounded in a very meaningful way and went on to become a critical and a commercial success. In fact, following the 2.0 update and release of the Phantom Liberty expansion, it's one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">best comeback stories in modern times for games.</a></p><p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-cyberpunk-2077-has-earned-so-far/1100-6522250/" data-ref-id="1100-6522250">more than 25 million units sold</a>, it's one of the most successful video games in history. Naturally, CD Projekt Red is moving ahead with a sequel that's in development right now at one of the team's newest studios.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which doesn't have an official title as of yet and is in the works under the working title Project Orion.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, CD Projekt is working on The Witch 4, a remake of the original Witcher, a new IP, and more--the studio is very busy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Cyberpunk 2077 sequel be released?</h2><p>This is a big unknown. So far, CD Projekt Red and upper management at the Polish studio have spoken in broad strokes about Cyberpunk 2077 and have shied away from specifics. Management has not provided even a release window, or a target, for the game. This is not unusual, though, as the game is no doubt still early in development. For context, Cyberpunk 2077 was announced in 2012 and wouldn't be released until eight years later. So fans should get comfortable as they await the sequel.</p><h2>Preorder Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</h2><p>Preorders for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are not open yet, and if you see any retailer taking orders this early, you should not give them your money or information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363241" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363241"></a><figcaption>A scene from Cyberpunk 2077</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg"></figure><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel trailer information</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2077's sequel has no trailer or even any concept art as of yet. Rest assured, as soon as we get information on art or video for Cyberpunk 2077's sequel, we'll bring it to you.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel platforms</h2><p>Platforms for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel have not been confirmed, but CD Projekt has a history of supporting both PC and console. The studio operates its own PC storefront, GOG, which offers games without DRM. It's likely that would be the case for Cyberpunk 2077's sequel as well, though this is not confirmed as of yet.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is basically nothing to go on in terms of specifics for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel at this stage pertaining to its story, settings, and characters. Fans can reasonably assume, however, that it'll be another RPG set in the future. It will also be "uniquely American," which follows on from the news that the game is being developed by CD Projekt's new team in Boston.</p><p>"I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story," acting executive producer Dan Hernberg explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">an episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a>. "It's got a lot of like, punk energy, and [the tabletop game] was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America."</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel game engine</h2><p>In 2022, CD Projekt shocked some fans by announcing it would abandon its own internal engine, Red Engine, and instead partner with Epic Games to use the company's Unreal Engine 5 for its future projects.</p><p>CTO Pawel Zawodny said Unreal Engine 5's updates help with the kind of open-world game development that the Polish studio is known for, and this was a major selling point. "This opens a new chapter for us, where we really want to see how our experience building open-world games is combined with the engineering power of Epic," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-explains-why-its-using-unreal-engine-5/1100-6502196/" data-ref-id="1100-6502196">Zawodny said.</a></p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363244" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363244"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2077.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg"></figure><h2>Who's developing Cyberpunk 2077 sequel?</h2><p>CD Projekt Red is developing Cyberpunk 2077's sequel. Specifically, the company's newest office in Boston, Massachusetts is leading development on the game. A number of staffers from the first Cyberpunk 2077 relocated to Boston to work on the sequel, including Igor Sarzyński, the narrative director for Cyberpunk 2077 and Project Orion.</p><p>"I couldn't be more excited for this project and I'm sure we can make it something special. 2077 was just a warm-up," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-is-looking-to-be-something-special-dev-says/1100-6520213/#:~:text=Project%20Orion%20currently%20has%20no%20release%20date.&amp;text=CDPR%20has%20officially%20started%20to,ll%20be%20%22something%20special.%22" data-ref-id="1100-6520213">Sarzyński said on social media earlier this year</a>.</p><p>CD Projekt's team in Vancouver is also working on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and the company's network of other global studios may contribute to its development as well. The game's director is Gabe Amatangelo, who was the game director on Cyberpunk 2077's popular Phantom Liberty expansion.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel development news</h2><p>As of February 2024, the Cybperunk 2077 sequel was in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along/1100-6520849/" data-ref-id="1100-6520849">"early stages of development,"</a> CD Projekt said in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cyberpunk-2077-follow-up-codenamed-project-orion-grows-in-strength-at-cd-projekt-red-north-america/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">news release</a>. The team working on the game includes a number of senior staffers from the original game, including Gabriel Amatangelo (game director), Paweł Sasko (associate game director), Igor Sarzyński (creative director), Andrzej Stopa (cinematic director), Kacper Niepokólczycki (environment art director), Sarah Grümmer (acting lead quest designer), and Kacper Kościeński (engineering director).</p><p>As for people who joined the Boston studio to work on the sequel, these include former lead product manager at Blizzard, Dan Hernberg, who is an executive producer on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel; IO Interactive and Massive Entertainment's Ryan Barnard as design director; and Mortal Kombat technical director Alan Villani, who is engineering director on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up.</p><p>Additionally, writer Anna Megill (Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Guild Wars 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora) is joining the Cyberpunk sequel as its lead writer. Megill also worked on the narrative elements for Microsoft's upcoming Fable game. Finally, novelist and comic book writer Alexander Freed is working on the writing for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Freed was previously a lead writer at BioWare on Star Wars: The Old Republic, and he also wrote or consulted for DICE, Obsidian, and Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Pawel Sasko, the associate director of the next Cyberpunk game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-aims-to-retain-the-whole-dna-of-first-game/1100-6522708/" data-ref-id="1100-6522708">said</a> he's interested in expanding on the concept of reactivity that was more of a focus in Phantom Liberty, which he worked on as quest director.</p><p>"We want to make sure that whole DNA is preserved and still in the game. In Phantom Liberty, there's this moment where the story splits almost, and that's the structure that we used with Witcher 2, actually, and Blood and Wine with Witcher 3 as well--where you had a split in the middle [that leads to] completely different branches with completely different endings," Sasko explained.</p><p>Sasko also mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 needs to validate its players' choices. "If you in your story have made a certain choice and that's the way you have decided to go with your V and your partners and whoever else you met in the game, that's your story. It's important when making those decisions not to invalidate what players have been doing because it is their story and the decisions they made," the developer said.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as we learn more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/livestream-showcases-90-minutes-of-silent-hill-2-remake-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Japanese streamer 2RBO. livestreamed 90 minutes of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, which Bloober Team is developing with a release date of October 8, 2024. The live stream showed off the early area gameplay, introducing the players to James Sunderland, a man looking for his wife in Silent Hill. In this livestream, fans get to watch the livestreamer travel through the city, comparing the sights of the new game to the original, expressing their excitement (as read via translated captions) at the differences made with new graphics.</p>
<p><iframe title="【リメイク版を世界最速配信!?】弟者,おついちの「サイレントヒル２(2024) | SILENT HILL 2 (2024)」【2BRO.】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTxhiokIUxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2's remake features ray-tracing and new technical enhancements to add to the thick atmosphere of Silent Hill 2, with new immersive soundscapes, as well as the option to turn on a filter that gives the game the 90's feel, making it noisy and even foggier than before.</p>
<p>As seen in the live stream, there is a stark difference between the camera of the original Silent Hill 2 and the remake. In the remake, the camera is now over the shoulder so that you are closer to the character, providing more immersion when fighting off enemies and being jump-scared. When picking up items and spotting secrets, the high-quality graphics and the over-the-shoulder camera will make things significantly more accessible, and James will look over at essential items to nudge players in the right direction.</p>
<p>The original Silent Hill 2 featured many inaccessible buildings and locations, but the remake has sought to open up those areas, allowing players to explore more thoroughly and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-completionist-route-will-take-more-than-20-hours/">access new puzzles and items</a> to aid them on their journey through the game. In the livestream, some of these areas are shown off, with the streamer also stating that they remember being unable to access certain areas in the original. The buildings don't necessarily hold items of interest, with some of them just being an extra way to jumpscare the player.</p>
<p>In the livestream, players also get a first glance at the updated combat system, which was severely clunky in the original. Players will get to use iconic weapons from the original such as the Steel Pipe and Handgun. Still, the combat system will make it easier to attack enemies, while having to perfect your dodges to avoid taking damage. Combining the new combat system with the new camera system makes for a terrifying experience showcased in the livestream, with the streamer coming up against many enemies in plain sight or waiting in ambush.</p>

I’m also curious to hear more about these gross grenades, which are giving me visions of the piss bombs from <em>Death Stranding</em>.  </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>recently got to see a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">behind closed-doors, hands-off preview</a></span> of <em>Shattered Space</em>. “While you can leave the planet any time you wish, given <em>Starfield</em>’s open nature, the plot here is entirely self-contained, and exploration of the planet and the city will lead to uncovering exactly what happened here, and, we’re told, becoming ‘entangled in the political feud between the minor houses,’” wrote John Walker in response to what was shown. “This refocusing of how <em>Starfield</em> is played and experienced could be a boon for the ailing project.”</p><p>I certainly hope the strong sense of mood and much more confined storytelling creates a denser feeling of possibilities to explore and secrets to uncover in <em>Shattered Space</em>. My favorite moments from the base game weren’t firing up my ship’s engines and pondering all the places I could go, but rather navigating strained loyalties and menacing deceptions in individual cities and questlines. We’ll find out if it’s worked when the expansion arrives on Xbox and PC later this month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-will-start-sharing-more-revenue-with-creators.974304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237039/roblox-share-revenue-creators-paid-experiences-rdc-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Roblox marches toward its ultimate goal of 1 billion users, the company is finding new ways to share revenue with the developers who have made millions of games on the platform.</p><p>During the company’s annual developers conference in San Francisco on Friday, CEO David Baszucki announced that creators of these games, which Roblox calls experiences, will be able to keep between 50 and 70 percent of revenue from their paid titles when they’re purchased in real currency on desktop computers. That’s significantly more than the roughly 30 percent revenue split Roblox<em> </em>gives developers for purchases made with its native Robux currency inside freemium experiences. </p><p>The move could help incentivize the creation of more premium games as Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23775268/roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-gaming-metaverse-robux-virtual-reality">looks to attract older users</a>. Baszucki says the intention is to also bring these new economics to paid experiences bought on other devices, including mobile phones and consoles, though app store fees will likely get in the way on iOS and Android. He declined to share specifics.</p><div><figcaption><em>A breakdown of Roblox’s revenue sharing for paid experiences on desktop.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>“We believe we’re setting the groundwork for a more expansive range of type of content on the platform,” Baszucki tells me with regard to paid experiences. In addition, he says there’s “a huge effort within the company to support 100-plus-player open-world sports or battle royale-type experiences on low-end devices.” Though he doesn’t say it, that strategy is seemingly aimed at competing more directly with Epic Games’ <em>Fortnite</em>, which Roblox<em> </em>still doesn’t have a viable alternative to on its platform.</p><p>Another way Roblox is sharing money with creators is via a new affiliate link program. Those who are accepted into it will be able to earn up to 50 percent (capped at $100) of Robux purchases a new user makes within six months after joining from their sign-up link. “I think it’s going to make it a lot easier for creators to be comfortable leaning into heavy social marketing” for the platform, says Baszucki of the new program.</p><div><figcaption>Roblox<em>’s new Party mode.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox’s<em> </em>other big announcements at this year’s developer conference include a new “Party” mode that lets up to six people communicate and move between experiences as a group. Starting early next year, it’s<em> </em>also partnering with Shopify to let developers sell real-world items through the platform. Revenue sharing terms of that arrangement haven’t been disclosed yet. </p><p>While Roblox’s daily user base continued to steadily grow to 79.5 million last quarter, the company has come under fire in a recent <em>Bloomberg </em>investigation titled <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">“Roblox’s<em> </em>Pedophile Problem.”</a> After that story was published this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216300/turkey-blocks-roblox-instagram">the government of Turkey banned <em>Roblox</em></a>, citing its hosting of “virtual sex parties” and “violent games” played by children. Roblox<em> </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-04/roblox-turkey-ban-tied-to-kids-access-to-virtual-sex-parties">this week appealed the ban</a>, and Baszucki tells me, “We’re optimistic and working with their government and their courts.”</p><p>He says that “any incident on our platform is unacceptable” and that trust and safety is the “top priority” inside the company. “Our AI gets better all the time. Our human review gets better all the time. So, from my standpoint, the quality of our safety systems has constantly been improving.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After watching the announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers of the Eyeless</a>, I have one request: please, do not have that voiceover in the full game. It is hammier than a hamster eating a ham sandwich in Hamburg during a performance of Hamlet. It starts with "The Whispers [of the Eyeless] call to me!!!" and does not improve from there. Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

Created by Evil Gingerbread Studios and Venris, the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> mod SFO, Whispers Of The Eyeless is about growing a terrible cult beneath a pretty awful city, so as to resurrect three dead gods: Wrath, Desire, and Madness. It's a strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with grim storybook art reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>, a turn-based combat system and a splash of base and army-building. Other inspirations include Loop Hero, Children Of Morta and Polish folklore at large. 
</p>
<p>
"Assume the role of the last descendent of the Old Faith and First Prophet of the New Age in the city of Aranthor where new and old gods vie for power," proclaims <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">the Steam blurb</a>. "Defeated, exiled and nearly forgotten, the Dead Gods have been silent for generations. But finally... the Whispers have returned. The 'Dead' Gods were not dead, and it is up to you to reinstate them to their full glory."
</p>
<p>
The aforesaid city is presided over by various upstart Living Gods, and broken into districts with distinct enemies, local culture and histories. Each district is home to a "branching web of events". You'll seemingly visit them on your lonesome as cult leader - there isn't any party-based combat in the trailer - but you can recruit people as cultists and ordain them as disciples, who can be sent on missions. 
</p>
<p>
There's also the question of which particular Dead God you favour, with consequences including different decorations for your underground den of cosmic villainy. "Upgrade your base, enact divine Benedictions, and make Sacrifices to the Dead Gods to strengthen the cult and increase your power in the city as Prophet," the blurb goes on. "The God you favor will impact your Sanctum's appearance, which can be customized to your liking."
</p>
<p>
Whispers Of The Eyeless is in the "very late stages of development", according to publishers Camlann Games, and will enter Steam early access in either Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 - in other words, later this winter or early next spring. You can expect a demo in one of Valve's forthcoming Steam Next Fests - either October 2024 or February 2025. Here's hoping the launch trailer narration is a fading memory by then.
