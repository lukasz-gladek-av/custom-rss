			<p>The PlayStation Portal handheld system may be about to get a highly-requested feature soon, judging from a PS App leak.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ohdvol/streaming_owned_games_imminent/">PlayStation Portal official subreddit</a>, user GetTheWetsOn shared a screenshot captured from the PS App of the Deliver at All Costs store page, which seemingly confirms that cloud streaming of purchased digital games could be coming to the PlayStation Portal for PS Plus Premium subscribers. The user also stated that the same confirmation, which has since been removed, could be found on the Dead Space remake store page.</p>



<p>While there's no indication this new PlayStation Portal streaming option is indeed coming, its confirmation on the store pages of two different games is unlikely to be a mistake, so there's a high chance it will eventually arrive on the system. </p>



<p>Ever since the system's release and its surprising popularity, Sony has repeatedly iterated that the company is looking into <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming/">expanding the system's functionality</a>. Allowing streaming of owned digital PlayStation games without having to download them first on their home system would be the perfect way to do so.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal is a Remote Play focused handheld device which launched back in 2023 worldwide. While not the successor of the PlayStation Vita many have been expecting for a long time, the system does what it does exceptionally well. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> developers Don't Nod have revealed that they're working on a new narrative game based around a "major IP" in partnership with Netflix. The game'll be developed at Don't Nod's Montreal studio, with the chilling-based streaming service set to publish it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This deal was announced via Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">latest financial results</a>, which detail how they've done in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. CEO Oskar Guilbert characterised the first six months of this year as having seen "solid revenue growth", though the company's total operating revenue of €13.9 million was down by 5% compared to the first half of 2024. A "performance plan" they've enacted after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs">a rough period</a> - which saw staff laid off, games put on pause, and Guilbert himself accused of "catastrophic management" by the French union STJV - is expected to start paying larger dividends soon.</p>
<p>This deal with Netflix is cited as a "key milestone" in that effort to turn things around. "The project finances the Montreal studio and aligns with the Group's strategy to secure its resources and strengthen its ability to evolve in an increasingly competitive and selective market," Don't Nod say in addition to blowing their own storytelling trumpet.</p>
<p>There's no indication of which Netflix show might be getting the game treatment, but the socials have very much begun to fill with 'Life is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>' jokes. Personally, I think it'll be an adaptation of Victoria Beckham's fashion documentary which also rewinds back Lost Records-style to her and David's heyday in the 90s and early 2000s. Either that or something about a serial killer. Or maybe Wednesday Addams is going to make a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543830/The_Addams_Family_Mansion_Mayhem/">less party-centric</a> return to the gamisphere.</p>
<p>Until we find out, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-bloom-review%3EGraham's%20review">Graham's review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>'s first tape a re-read. It made him ask important questions:</p>
<blockquote>Is it possible that this video game of Young Adult tropes and teenage girl protagonists just isn't meant for me? I have a few rebuttals to that idea. For one, hey, this game also contains the tired 40-something version of those characters, which I obviously find deeply relatable. I was also a kid in the '90s and feel a growing nostalgia for Hey Arnold! and my Nintendo 64. I bet I'd love Yellowjackets, and I own a Rainbow Rowell novel and one day I might even read it, but really I just think that good writing can transcend demographics.</blockquote>
<p>You'll always be a young adult to me, former bossman.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ahead-of-black-friday-hp-laptop-with-17%E2%80%B3-ips-screen-i3-chip-and-1tb-ssd-is-now-70-off.1337995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s not Black Friday yet, but Amazon has already rolled out a few serious laptop deals that shouldn’t be missed. Those looking for a powerful work or study partner should consider the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5080/">17.3-inch HP laptop (Intel Core i3, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM) that’s now going at a 70% discount for a short time</a>.</p>
<p>It normally would run you <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5080/">around $2,200, but this deal brings the price down to just $650</a>, and that’s not the only offer here. You’re also getting an accessory bundle worth <strong>$240 thrown in for absolutely free</strong>! This laptop is also marked as an Amazon’s Choice product and has a 4.7-star rating, so grabbing it at this price feels like a steal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5080/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger Screen, Better Performance</h2>
<p>The price might make it seem like a basic option, but it’s far from that. It boasts a massive 17.3-inch diagonal high-resolution display with narrow bezels. You’re getting a large screen real estate to work on, plus solid visuals that make the content pop. The keyboard is slightly elevated using a new lift-hinge design, so typing long documents won’t make your wrists hurt by the end of the day.</p>
<p>There’s an 8-core Intel i3-N305 processor to ensure fast performance, plus 16 GB DDR4 high-bandwidth RAM for smoother multitasking. Storage is taken care of by a 1TB PCIe SSD, which gives you quick boot times and fast file access, plus sufficient space to have all your important files and content in one place.</p>

Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, plus a wide range of ports for connecting your accessories. Speaking of accessories, the free bundle gets you a design mouse, a colorful gaming keyboard, Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed), and a data cable organizer. Getting the OS pre-installed means you will have instant access to a wide range of productivity features from the get-go, plus Microsoft’s new Copilot AI assistant, which you can also launch directly using the dedicated Copilot key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>All things considered, this laptop is made for both work and everyday use. It can support your most productive days without throwing a fit, and comes with a set of useful accessories that add even more value to the deal. Grab this 70% off discount before it expires for good.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts-2000639685</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts.1337992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooting high-quality video with exceptional vibrancy and just the right angles is just half the story. You need clean audio to get the message, excitement and even frustration across. Most cameras out there have built-in microphones but they are not always enough: If you want that professional audio that cuts through background chatter and reaches with exceptional clarity, it might be time <strong>for a proper wireless mic system</strong>.</p>
<p>DJI – one of our favorite go-to brands for cameras – also has a solid lineup of wireless microphones and we just spotted an option going for less. The DJI Mic Mini, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">which typically retails for $119, is now going for just $74 at Amazon, after a generous 38% discount</a>. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen in the past 30 days; even Prime Day didn’t bring it this low. We recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as the offer might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Range With Two Noise Cancellation Modes</h2>
<p>This setup gives you two transmitters and one receiver, so it’s perfect for when you’re shooting with more than one user. Each transmitter is small, lightweight, and can be worn/clipped easily. It doesn’t feel bulky or look unpleasant on camera. Despite its tiny size, it offers a maximum transmission range of 400 meters for stronger signals both indoors and outdoors. Recording in those busy streets and jam-packed cafeterias won’t be a problem, ever again.</p>
<p>You’re also getting two noise cancellation modes; basic and strong. The basic mode is ideal for relatively quieter environments, like your home, while the strong mode is more appropriate for noisier settings. It also comes with an automatic limiting feature that reduces volume spikes and maintains a consistent tone; your audience won’t be hit with an unexpected jumpscare mid-video.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 10 hours of operating time on both the transmitters and the receiver. This is more than enough for longer shoots, and you can even go a couple of days without plugging them in. The DJI Mic Mini also plays well with a wide range of devices. Even without the receiver, you can pair the transmittor with DJI devices like the Osmo Pocket 3 and Osmo Action 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In the box, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, a mobile adapter, a camera audio cable, clip magnets, windscreens, a charging dock, and a carrying pouch. Keep in mind that the offer might end soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale.1337986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield REDSEC offers several new ways to play Battlefield 6. It arrived after Battlefield 6’s launch, just like Warzone did after MW 2019, and we’re here to let you know if you can play for free, and if so, how.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched with a campaign and multiplayer. Throw in Portal, and you’ve got yourself a pretty meaty bundle. However, we always knew EA and Battlefield Studios had more ideas up their sleeves. This materialized on October 28 with the launch of Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC</a>.</p>



<p>It came bundled with battle royale (no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo mode</a>, though) and the hot new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet</a> playlist. Let’s see if you need Battlefield 6 to play it, though. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-redsec-without-owning-battlefield-6">Can You Play REDSEC Without Owning Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to enjoy for free. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Battlefield: REDSEC for free without needing to own a full, paid copy of Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Call of Duty and Warzone, REDSEC is an independent release separate from Battlefield 6. This means you can enjoy a premium Battlefield 6 experience without needing to pay a single penny.</p>



<p>All BR modes are free-to-play, as is Gauntlet Mode. We’re sure REDSEC will add new features and modes over the coming months and years as well. Has there ever been a better time to be a Battlefield fan?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec">How To Play Battlefield REDSEC</h2>



<p><strong>To play Battlefield REDSEC, you need to go into your relevant storefront, download it, wait for it to install, and you can jump straight into EA’s free-to-play Battlefield experience.</strong></p>



<p>For an easy breakdown of what to do, check out these simple instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the game.</li>



<li>Choose to download <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Wait for the download to complete.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can now boot up REDSEC and play it for free!</li>
</ol>



<p>There was speculation that REDSEC was going to be free, but only for players who already own Battlefield 6—technically making it not free. However, this is a smart decision on EA’s part and should do a lot to help both Battlefield 6 and REDSEC have a long battery life.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’ve had a chance to play REDSEC yet. Can you not get enough of Gauntlet? Or is the allure of battle royale still proving to be too much?

<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is walking away from making new content from its MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-world-aeternum">New World</a>, amid huge layoffs affecting 14,000 roles at the company. Now, there is concern over the status of its The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, October 28, Amazon confirmed cuts affecting an eye-watering 14,000 roles. It’s one of the biggest round of layoffs the tech giant has ever seen, and comes at a time when other companies in the tech sector, such as Microsoft and Meta, have made similarly huge cuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also comes at a time when Amazon is performing well. So why are they happening? AI, basically. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to employees</a>, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said:</p><blockquote>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean for Amazon’s gaming business? According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, nothing good. There are “significant” cuts coming to Amazon’s video game operation, which will reduce development work and layoff staff mainly in its Irvine and San Diego offices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The New World changes are a part of that, and while the game will remain online during 2026, this is basically the beginning of the end for once hugely popular MMO. Let’s remember, New World was a rare hit for Amazon in the video game space, and followed multiple flops that resulted in game and studio closures. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents on Valve's platform back in 2021. Player numbers have significantly declined since that peak, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg said Amazon is cutting back especially on MMOs, but will continue to develop Amazon Games Montreal’s strategy March of Giants, its new Tomb Raider game in the works at Crystal Dynamics, and "casual and AI-focused games" for its cloud gaming service Luna. UK studio Maverick Games will continue to work on its racing game, too. Amazon Games also continues to publish externally developed games such as Lost Ark and Throne &amp; Liberty in western markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">an in-house The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, although we haven’t heard much about it since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-coming-from-new-world-developer-amazon-games">it was announced in 2023</a>. In August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann told IGN</a> the company had 10 games in development and was negotiating "a couple more." These include Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings MMO, as well as the new driving game from the former developers behind Forza Horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On The Lord of the Rings MMO, however, Hartmann insisted it was still early days. "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Amazon for an update on The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also plenty of questions around Tomb Raider, which has been caught up in the mire around the Embracer Group. Hartmann mostly waved off those concerns, saying that developer Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine. I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here," Hartmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered, because also when you look before...they went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand new for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">Crystal Dynamics recently laid off a number of workers following Microsoft’s cancelation of the Perfect Dark reboot</a>. At the time, the studio insisted Tomb Raider was still in development and unaffected by the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal Dynamics was originally brought in to revitalize Perfect Dark after struggles getting the project moving with former co-developer, Certain Affinity. Crystal was later acquired by the Embracer Group in 2022, at which time the studio was revealed to have 273 employees across its Austin, Bellevue, and San Mateo offices. Crystal laid off 10 people in 2023, and laid off 17 more people earlier this year. It's unclear how many remain now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uses this tactic too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sparks-yellow-paint-debate-once-again"><u>players sharing their thoughts on it</u></a> and leaving Hamaguchi himself surprised about the debate it stirred at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Hamaguchi said he understood there are some people who don't want or need the yellow paint, but insisted that it was necessary.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The need to guide players around from from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there is definitely times where that is needed," he added. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the yellow paint debate kicked off with Rebirth last year, some said they didn't like how in-your-face the hand-holding was not just in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, but modern video games. Others, however, pointed out that it could be helpful, and was an important accessibility feature. Developers, too, weighed in, with some highlighting how in playtests and focus groups, players sometimes struggle to work out where to go, get frustrated, and quit playing altogether. Because of this, somewhat obvious and sometimes unrealistic visual clues are needed to help point players in the right direction. And some have pointed out that video games have featured visual clues for exploration and progression for decades now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With discussion around the yellow paint in FF7R, who remembers the options red/green arrows plus giant pointer available in the original FF7? <a href="https://t.co/qMLnKh3rGw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qMLnKh3rGw</a></p>— John Linneman @dark1x.bsky.social (@dark1x) <a href="https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1756686944178676036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Hamaguchi's comments, perhaps fans can expect the yellow paint to return for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> received both its Season One update yesterday, as well as the Redsec battle royale mode in a massive content update for the popular military FPS. Not everyone is happy though.</p>
<p>While many are having a good time with the update, others are dejected due to the influx of microtransactions, relatively colourful cosmetics, and weekly battle pass challenges that can push players towards the battle royale mode they may not be interested in. It seems like Battlefield 6, which has largely been sailing smoothly since launch, has hit turbulent weather.</p>
<p>Starting with the battle pass, you progress through it via BP points, which are earned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oio6d7/dear_dice_if_i_wanted_to_play_a_terrible/">through the completion of weekly challenges</a> as well as XP gained through playing. These points unlock tiers of the battle pass, filled with cosmetics, boosts, and currency rewards.</p>

<p>These challenges previously could be completed in any mode for the most part, aside from a few specific challenges for certain unlockables. However these battle pass challenges can force players to jump into the battle royale. They can be rerolled, but if you reroll and land on battle royale challenges, you're stuck with them.</p>
<p>These cosmetics are <em>largely</em> thematic with the military aesthetic of Battlefield 6, such as various digital camouflages. However these have rubbed some players the wrong way, especially, those that found the authentic look of the classes at launch appealing.</p>
<p>The battle pass also isn't simply offered in a free and paid form. Players can buy separate bundles that provide different rewards. There's the Season One Starter pack, the Season One Advanced Pack, the Rogue Ops pack, and the Season One Pro Pack. Then there are the skins added to the in-game store itself, which must be bought with Battlefield coins.</p><p>It's a sharp turn away from the more pure FPS experience people have been playing in droves this month, and what seemed to tempt people to the game as they tire of the uber-capitalist trudge that Call of Duty has become.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is in the midst of its one-year anniversary celebrations, and a new set is right around the corner in Mega Rising, for which we have all the release date and start time details.</p>



<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>TCG Pocket’s B1 Mega Rising set will be released on Thursday, October 30, as confirmed by the trailer for the new set.</strong></p>



<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-start-times">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The B1 Mega Rising set will be available in the game from 11 PM PT on October 29, with a release on October 30 for the majority of the world.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time and date for major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Rising Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Oct. 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Oct. 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-confirmed-cards-list">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Confirmed Cards List</h2>



<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards. In total, there are 331 cards in the set—broken down into 226 normal cards and 105 Secret Rares.</p>



<p>The set will be split into three booster packs, like Genetic Apex was in the initial release of the game.</p>

<p>The release will boast the full game alongside key expansions and improvements, plus full cooperative play via online connection. If that's not enough, Repentance+ will also benefit from a full physical release, so no Game-Key Card here, folks.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://store.nicalis.com/products/repplus?variant=46804993999105">official Nicalis store</a>, though we'll be honest, we felt a bit of minor bit of whiplash at the <strong>£54</strong> asking price. It's not horrendous, but it's also not what we'd call 'affordable'.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Online play in all game modes, including daily runs, Greed mode, and challenges.<br>
- Extensive preference filters when hosting or searching for online matches.<br>
- Emote wheel and voice chat for online communication.<br>
- New “Item Descriptions” option reveals the full functionality of items you’ve previously collected.<br>
- New leaderboards for online play.<br>
- Over 700 different items to collect.<br>
- More than 300 enemy types and bosses.<br>
- Multiple difficulty settings, game modes, branching paths and endings to discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chances are this one will almost certainly be available digitally, so we'll be sure to provide more updates, including its price, as soon as we can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was practically a given following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the mass layoffs at Amazon Game Studios</a>, but we now have confirmation that New World, the MMORPG developed by the team based in Irvine, California, is effectively on life support.</p>



<p>Amazon has clarified that Season 10: Nighthaven, which launched earlier this month, will be the last content update because further development 'is not sustainable'. The servers are, however, guaranteed to remain up throughout December 31, 2026 at the least. Complete closure of the servers will likely follow shortly after that date, although Amazon said it will notify players at least six months before that happens.</p>



<p>For now, the game and its in-game currency remain purchasable on all platforms, and New World also remains playable on PlayStation 5 for PlayStation Plus subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers. Again, when that changes, Amazon will send a notice.</p>



<p>The MMORPG was the first big project financed by Amazon as part of its gaming initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-reveals-breakaway-new-world-crucible-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was originally revealed at TwitchCon 2016</a> alongside the MOBA Breakway and the third-person shooter game Crucible, which however were canceled before or shortly after their launch.</p>



<p>New World, on the other hand, kept going, albeit with a few delays. The original vision was for a sandbox-style PvP focused MMORPG, but the team pivoted to a more traditional PvE game with dungeons and story missions while still retained some PvP elements from the previous design.</p>



<p>As someone who followed the game throughout its entire development and then spent a couple of hundred hours playing it, I can say that this confusing design was among the game's biggest failures. While a lot of people were hyped for its release in September 2021 as the first Western-made AAA MMORPG to launch since 2014's The Elder Scrolls Online, leading to a strong debut that <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even Jeff Bezos praising the team</a>, it became immediately clear that there wasn't nearly enough PvE content to keep PvE players interested. On the other hand, the PvP limitations (optional flagging, no looting, etc.) that were introduced to cater to those PvE players ensured that even the PvP niche was not satisfied.</p>



<p>The game could only keep me and my guild interested for two months before boredom inevitably set in. Overall, players left in droves. To their credit, the developers started working on more PvE content, as evidenced by the following updates, the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year's Aeternum rebrand and console launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, it was simply not enough to turn the tide. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final attempt with Season 10: Nighthaven</a> actually caught the interest of MMO fans, allowing the game to rebound and bringing back long server queues, but it was probably too little, too late at that point, as Amazon had already decided to close down the project.</p>



<p>So far, Amazon has not clarified what will happen to The Lord of the Rings MMO project, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revived two years ago</a>. It is most likely dead, too, but we have asked for an official statement on the matter.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> has seen its last content update, with Amazon Games confirming their development of the MMO is winding down. The game's servers will be staying online in the short term. This news follows mass layoffs at Amazon, with over 14,000 roles reportedly being affected across the company and the gaming division seeing "significant" cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These layoffs were initially reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">Bloomberg</a>. Amazon haven't confirmed exactly how many staff in its video game arm have been affected by the layoffs, though New World developers Amazon Games Orange County have seen "significant" cuts.</p>
<p>What has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">been made 100% clear</a> by Amazon vice president of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom is that these layoffs are seeing the company move away from heavy investment into MMOs, with recently re-launched cloud service Amazon Luna being doubled down on. The company will plough on with some of the other games it's got in the works or is publishing, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">a new Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics</a>, strategy game March of the Giants, and an unannounced racer from Maverick Games.</p>
<p>That brings us to New World and a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">news post</a> published by Amazon Games late yesterday. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," it reads. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles."</p><p>While it won't be getting any more additions alongside essential bug fixes, the MMO won't disappear overnight. Amazon Games plan to keep its servers running "through 2026" and say they'll provide at least six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable. In the meantime, New World's Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are being dished out for free on PC. You can also still buy and use in-game currency like Marks of Fortune for the moment, but no refunds'll be offered on any you've already bought.</p>
<p>"Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey," the post concludes. "We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by Amazon's mass layoffs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-clears-out-some-star-wars-sets-ahsoka-tano%E2%80%99s-duel-on-peridea-is-going-for-peanuts.1337926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been nearly two weeks since Microsoft, a multi-trillion dollar company, shipped <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">a $600 handheld “Xbox”</a> that can’t be relied on to sleep, wake, or hold a charge while asleep in my tests. Neither Microsoft nor Asus would admit there’s a problem with the white Xbox Ally or offer a timeline to fix it after repeated requests by <em>The Verge</em>. (Asus tells me it needs more time to test.)</p><p>But if you want your white Asus handheld to start working reliably, you <em>could</em> do what I did: I installed the latest build <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">of Bazzite</a>, a SteamOS-like, Linux-based operating system that works properly with gamepad controls, and sleeps like a dream. I didn’t need to hibernate or shut down once this past weekend as I blazed through hours of <em>Silksong</em> and finally triumphed in a tough boss fight.</p><p>Did I mention Bazzite runs most of my Windows games <em>substantially faster </em>than Windows?</p><div><h2>Bazzite vs. Windows vs. Deck OLED</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Win 11)</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X (Z2E)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>39</td><td>23.08%</td><td>50</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>41</td><td>29.27%</td><td></td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>54</td><td>43</td><td>25.58%</td><td>50</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>55</td><td>21.82%</td><td>64</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td></td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td>64</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>-16.67%</td><td>25</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td></td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td>25</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>51</td><td>15.69%</td><td>60</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>55</td><td>14.55%</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>64</td><td>55</td><td>16.36%</td><td>60</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>26</td><td>26.92%</td><td>34</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td>34</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates at 720p low, save </em>Cyberpunk 2077 <em>at 720p Steam Deck preset.

With Bazzite, the same device runs up to 30 percent faster than with Windows, and beats the Steam Deck in all but one of my gaming benchmarks.</p><p>It’s not just games that feel faster: Steam is a far more responsive interface without the bloat of Windows lurking under the hood. It feels like an entirely different handheld. With Bazzite, I can use it like I use a Nintendo Switch, simply pressing the power button whenever I want to pause a game, then picking up exactly where I left off hours or days later.</p><p>It’s faster to launch games, faster to wake from sleep; I also almost never need to touch the screen and leave fingerprints, something that still eludes Microsoft’s latest attempt at gamepad-controlled Windows.</p><div id=":R4ibcrij96:"><div><p><figcaption>Even the Ally’s buttons are less confusing under Bazzite.

And once again, I’ll admit I see no battery life advantage for Bazzite over Windows — occasionally, I even see Bazzite draining a watt more than Microsoft’s OS.</p><p>But it is <em>such a repudiation of Windows</em> that Microsoft’s first “Xbox” handheld, the one with a version of Windows that was supposed to reduce the bloat and fix performance and sleep modes, built by a multi-trillion dollar company, is so effortlessly beaten by the efforts of a few Linux programmers standing atop the shoulders of the roughly 300-person Valve and the broader Linux community.</p><p>Bazzite had a problem getting the white Xbox Ally to sleep too, at first. When I installed it on October 19th, pressing the power button put the system into a state where it wouldn’t wake up again; I needed to hard-reset every time. But that’s because Bazzite’s developers <em>didn’t </em>yet have an Xbox Ally. Two days after programmer Antheas Kapenekakis obtained the hardware and consulted with two contacts at AMD, the three fixed it — and got the Xbox Ally’s programable RGB joystick lights working in Linux, too.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Bazzite and its built-in Handheld Companion let you control the Ally’s TDP, buttons, and lighting with just a couple presses.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To give you some idea of just how unreliable the vanilla Xbox Ally is right now, I tested two of them last week, one with “Modern Standby Assist” and “Extreme Standby” turned on, the other off. I applied every update available, checked their batteries regularly, and monitored whenever they woke up.</p><p>Both repeatedly woke up all by themselves at seemingly random intervals, just sitting on my desk, then usually put themselves back to sleep. The deeper sleeper lost 10 percent of its battery life after 12 hours, the other lost 23 percent. (The latter needed to be woken up twice in a row for the gamepad to continue working.)</p><p>But after another 12 hours, I found both handhelds only had 30 percent battery remaining. I’m not sure what happened to one, but the other had clearly tried to apply a Windows Update when it should have been asleep. Separately, I also saw both Windows units refuse to wake from sleep, requiring a hard reset before they would come back to life again. Some Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obltnp/anyone_else_having_these_issues/">also reported</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obka7w/xbox_ally_x_sleepwake_help/">that issue</a> with both versions of the Xbox Ally, as well as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1oamybz/battery_drain_overnight/">surprise battery drain</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Even though it’s so much better with Bazzite, I hope Microsoft fixes Windows soon.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Microsoft declined our request for an interview about the future of the Xbox Ally or a timeline on fixes, but VP of Windows product management Anshul Rawat provided this statement to <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Windows and Xbox teams are aware of the challenges a limited number of players have experienced and are actively working to refine sleep and wake reliability. We’ve identified a small set of issues and initial fixes will be rolling out soon. Optimizing Windows, the most flexible OS in the world, for a range of devices and screen sizes across PCs and the cloud is an ongoing journey. As we work with our partners to provide a great experience on gaming handhelds, community feedback plays an important role in shaping these improvements for all players.</p></blockquote></div><p>We’ve asked Microsoft what it means by “limited number of players” and “rolling out soon.”</p><p>If I had bought an Xbox Ally myself, I’m not sure I’d wait for Microsoft to figure it out. At a minimum, I <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">would dual-boot</a>, occasionally swapping back to Windows to get new BIOS updates.</p><p>There are many lingering misconceptions about Linux gaming, like how it supposedly provides less choice than Windows, doesn’t offer game stores other than Steam, doesn’t play as many games, runs those games poorly by comparison.

            <p>I imagine the biggest question people who've put hundreds or thousands of hours into Amazon's MMO New World have right now is: are all my efforts about to be wiped? Is the game about to go offline, and close?</p>
<p>The concern, remember, comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">a report aired yesterday that Amazon is gutting its games business</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon has now addressed these questions and the top-line takeaway is ongoing New World development will cease. The game is in trouble. But will it close? The answer to that is hazier.</p>
<p>As it stands, Amazon won't guarantee the game's life beyond 2026, but it has promised to give you six months notice before turning anything off. Here are the pertinent questions and answers from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">the New World website</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Are you sunsetting the game?</em></p>
<p><em>"No, not at this time. While New World will not be receiving new content updates, servers will be live through 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>"How long will I be able to play New World: Aeternum?</em></p>
<p><em>"We will provide more details on what to expect in the coming months. We will provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding ongoing development: there simply won't be any. Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update will be the last updates released for the game, and by way of thanking you for your support over the years, they will be made free. The Rise of the Angry Earth update will also be made free but only for PC players. Holiday events in the game will also cease.</p><p>"After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," wrote the New World team by way of an explanation.</p>
<p>"In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.</p>
<p>"We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>New World launched in 2021 and, for a while, caused a stir. Its blend of faction versus faction PvP warfare, territorial warring, and skill-focused gameplay made it popular. But it has since fallen out of relevance, landing us, presumably, where we are now.</p><p>The game's potential server-closures stand in stark contrast to the fleet of decades-old MMOs that rumble on elsewhere in the industry, both colossal ones like World of Warcraft and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, and smaller ones such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/everquest-ii">EverQuest 2</a>. They are the sorts of games you make considerable time investments in, living as you do in their virtual worlds, and I imagine the prospect of losing all of that investment now is a very harsh - and disappointing and trust breaking - reality to face.</p>

<p>Live on Kickstarter now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rune_factory_4">Rune Factory 4</a> director Shinichi Manabe is currently hard at work creating a new farming sim alongside writer Takanori Tsuji, and it's now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1005170304/farnia-village/description">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Farnia Village</strong> is currently eyeing a release on Steam, but Manabe-san also states that a console release may be on the cards at some point in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game is being optimized to run comfortably on hardware comparable to the Nintendo Switch, which means it should perform well on most laptops. Looking ahead, we hope to bring the game to home consoles in the future, if possible."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The big hook (if you can really call it that) for Farnia Village is that you can continue living in its world long after you've completed the main quest. You'll be tending to your crops, looking after animals, forging relationships with the local residents, and more. In short, it's a farming sim through and through.</p>
<p>As for the release date, well... it sounds like it's quite a ways off, at the moment. The earliest delivery date listed in the pledges is 'September 2027', but some of them even state 'September 2028', so who knows. We won't be seeing this one for a while yet, and it's possible a console release could be even further out.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter is creeping toward its ¥5,000,000 goal (roughly £24,845) with another 29 days to go. Stretch goals include extra characters more dungeons and crops, and additional music tracks. If this all sounds good to you, then consider checking out the full campaign when you have a moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Remedy Entertainment published <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Q3 2025 financial report</a>. As expected, it's not great news for the Finnish studio. Tero Virtala, the company's CEO for nine years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">stepped do</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">n earlier this month</a> after Remedy told investors that the game FBC: Firebreak had effectively failed.</p>



<p>This past quarter, just as the studio celebrated the thirty years since its foundation, the financial highlights were indeed very negative:</p>



<ul>
<li>Revenue decreased by -32.0% to € 12.2 (17.9) million.</li>



<li>EBITDA was € 0.7 (6.6) million.</li>



<li>Operating profit (EBIT) was € -16.4 (2.4) million, and the operating profit margin was -135.1% (13.4%) of revenue.</li>



<li>Cash flow from operations was € 11.3 (8.0) million.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, interim CEO Markus Mäki reassured investors (and fans) that the remaining projects are on track, and the studio is still confident in its ability to achieve 'significant commercial success' by 2030.</p>



<p><em>Despite challenges with FBC: Firebreak, our other in-development projects are progressing according to plan. The majority of our effort goes into working with our established franchises – Control and Alan Wake – which we continue to invest in and expand into other media as part of our long-term strategy. In addition, we’re focused on the Max Payne 1&amp;2 remake with Rockstar Games. While carefully balancing our product risk, we also need to retain the ability to create new experiences for our audiences, as we have for the past 30 years. We aren’t satisfied with our recent financial performance, but we remain confident in our ability to create great video games that resonate with players and which are commercially successful, leading us back to profitability.</em></p>



<p>Remedy has set for itself the following financial targets:</p>



<ul>
<li>To reach a revenue two times higher than last year's by 2027 and then maintain continued growth beyond this milestone.</li>

			<p>With its many accessibility options, Ninja Gaiden 4 is one of the most approachable entries in the series, allowing players to experience its high-speed action without letting the high challenge level get in the way of enjoyment.</p>



<p> Those who want to truly appreciate the game, however, will wish to master many of its intricacies, put their skills to the test, and attempt to achieve an S rank for completing each of the story chapters.</p>



<p>Here are some tips to help you understand the mission scoring system and what you should always strive to do to achieve such a high rank.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: Tips and strategies tested in S rank mission completions at Normal and Hard difficulty over a total of 40+ hours in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-achieve-a-guaranteed-s-rank-in-ninja-gaiden-4">How To Achieve A Guaranteed S Rank in Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Your total completion rank for any mission in Ninja Gaiden, whether in Story Mode or Chapter Select mode, is decided by the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">total Karma score</strong>. Once it exceeds certain thresholds, the rank increases, up to the Master Ninja S Rank. This score depends on the obtained Technique Points, the total number of kills, Clear Time, and the Items Used and Deaths multipliers. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">These two multipliers are key to achieving a guaranteed S rank in all missions, regardless of difficulty.</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Imperfect-Run-S-Rank-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>A No Item Run of any Mission makes it possible to achieve S rank even if you don't take down every enemy in a mission</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, completing any Mission without using any item and without dying grants <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a 1.2x multiplier</strong> for your Karma score, which ensures even a lower Technique, Kills, and Clear Time score can surpass the threshold to achieve the highest rank, as you can see in my imperfect Mission 03 Normal Mode run above. Dying even once, however, will reduce your total Karma score with a negative multiplier, making it impossible to achieve S rank, so it should be avoided at all costs in S rank runs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">While achieving a No Item, No Death run of any Mission can be a challenge even at Normal difficulty, you can abuse the game's checkpoint system to avoid repeating runs from the beginning. Whenever your health gets into Critical Condition, as signaled by the visual noise on screen, open the menu and pick the Restart from Checkpoint option before you are defeated. This will bring warp you back to the nearest Terminal or Muramasa statue, with no penalty whatsoever. This is a classic PlatinumGames trick that works great in Ninja Gaiden 4</em> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">as well.</em></strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: The above trick has yet to be tested in Master Ninja mode, as its very high difficulty makes it challenging to even just complete a mission, let alone go for an S rank. Considering how this trick worked in almost every other action game developed by PlatinumGames at the highest difficulty, it should work just as well at Master Ninja mode. The guide will be updated with the confirmation once thorough testing has been conducted</strong></em>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> arrives in full today, October 29th. Ahead of the gates to Arcadia finally being flung open to those who didn't fancy paying extra for early access, Obsidian have taken a stab at fixing some key issues and pesky bugs which've reared their heads so far. Good news, unless your roleplaying was set to be contingent upon being swallowed up by the ground or having to try and beat up an angry cupboard at some point in the space adventure.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a look through the notes of <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-hotfix-1040">hotfix 1.0.4.0</a>, I've spotted a couple of minor hiccups I ran into during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review playthrough</a>, these being Aza the culty companion regularly indicating a need to chat when there was no fresh convo to be had and Golden Ridge's Monastery sometimes being a bit confusing to navigate despite the objective markers' best efforts.</p>
<p>Some more critical bugs swatted include a "permanent fade to black" which could seemingly see the game unintentionally declare 'that's all folks' when you returned to a certain landing pad, the acidic body dematerializer stopping you from equipping weapons if you saved while using it, and companion Inez sometimes being tough to find after her first encounter. Obsidian say they've also "improved the accuracy of information displayed during the end-of-game slides".</p>
<p>Beyond those, there are plenty of more generic bugs you might get early in a game's lifespan, such as certain actions leading the player to fall through the world, quests not progressing, placeholder text popping up, and some collision misbehaviour. Amusingly, the studio add that "the game will no longer crash when interrupting certain NPC bark dialogue lines by interacting with or killing one of the participating speakers" and that you'll no longer run into in issue which would lead you to be be stuck in perma-combat because an enemy was trapped in a closet.</p><p>Finally, I've reached out to Obsidian for clarification regarding the very first bug the post lists. You see, it says PS5 players have run into issues with premium edition gear not being handed out properly, and underneath there's a note which reads as follows: "Unfortunately, the Consumerism Flaw being rewarded is not fixed in this patch and will be addressed in a future hotfix". Since I'm not 100% sure at a glance whether that's PS5 specific like the gear issues, I've opted to double check in case my running into that flaw when I did on PC was related to some bugginess, rather than the gag myself and others have since assumed it to be.</p>
<p>If word comes through that it's just a bug after all, I'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/so-it-turns-out-the-outer-worlds-2-spent-95-of-its-runtime-mocking-me-for-a-purchase-i-didnt-make">update this piece</a> and don the Moon Man helmet of shame.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund isn't worried about Arc Raiders releasing between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to">In an interview with Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>, the former EA studio lead talked about the studio, The Finals' journey to profitability, and Embarks' approach to live service development. On the specific subject of Arc Raiders release date, Soderlund stated:</p>
<p>"People may look at that and say, 'what the hell are they doing?' We have spent a lot of time looking at this from multiple angles and you know, for right or wrong, we believe that the game can launch there. This is the start of a long journey. It needs to start somewhere."</p>

<p>Despite Arc Raiders' seemingly uncomfortable launch date, the game has garnered a substantial amount of positive attention from players. When asked how, Soderlund responded with the following: "I think it comes down to not being complacent enough to believe that we can build something without making a meaningful impact or innovation. We have to bring something so that people pay attention. And if we've done a good enough job, maybe they'll stick around. But in order for them to break away from what they're already playing, there needs to be an attraction."</p><p>This is just a small portion of an almost 50-minute interview, which is well worth listening to in full. But Arc Raiders' situation does harken back to an all-too familiar situation for Soderlund and many Embark Studios' initial staff. Soderlund was the executive vice president of EA when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> launched, itself squeezed between a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Arc Raiders can sustain its momentum while caught in a similar predicament remains to be seen, though perhaps an extra decade of experience, an intense feeling of virality around Arc Raiders, and a vastly different industry landscape can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders is set to release tomorrow on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With news of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m3zm9jnl1o">massive layoffs coming to parts of Amazon’s corporate business</a>, the company has also turned its baleful gaze towards its gaming division and announced that their MMORPG New World will no longer receive content updates after the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven content has run its course.</p>
<p>This isn’t an end of service notice just yet, with the companion FAQ stating that servers will be live through 2026 at least, and they will provide at least six months’ notice of a server shutdown. Because of that, and with the Nighthaven seasonal content still planned to roll out gradually, the New World is remaining on sale and part of the PS Plus library, and microtransaction currency will still be available, though the appeal of the game and player base will no doubt dwindle through the coming months.</p>


<p>We also await news of Amazon Game Studios’ future with dread….</p>
<p>New World arrived with a huge bang in 2021, as Amazon brought its fantasy colonialist MMORPG to PC, racing to a huge peak of over 900,000 concurrent players that pushed the servers beyond the limit. After such a strong start, the playerbase (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>) dwindled through early 2022, but enjoyed a new peak of over 130,000 for the first yearly expansion. Perhaps a lot of expectation was put internally on the potential of the console port, which arrived with a major game overhaul last September in the form of New World: Aeternum, but on PC at least, the game has spent much of this year with daily peak player counts below 10,000, jumping up to 50,000 with the new Nighthaven update. That’s roughly comparable with a Fallout 76 or Elder Scrolls: Online, so could easily have been sustainable depending on development expenditure, but it’s half of where Destiny 2 commonly is right now, and that game is widely regarded as being in serious trouble.</p>
<p>The announcement reads:</p>

<p><em>As New World recognizes its fourth anniversary since launching on PC, we reflect on an incredible journey shaped by our dedicated player community. Your feedback and passion have been instrumental in evolving Aeternum into the world it is today, and our team is deeply grateful for this shared adventure. After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.</em></p>
<p><em>The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players.</em></p>
<p><em>In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum. Additionally, New World: Aeternum will still be downloadable for PlayStation Plus members (Extra and Premium).</em></p>
<p><em>Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey. We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-romero-talking-companies-finish-game-funded-by-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-romero-says-he%E2%80%99s-talking-with-many-companies-to-finish-the-game-that-was-being-funded-by-microsoft.1337854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>John Romero might not be a name that youngsters recognize, but he was a legend of the early days of the first-person shooter genre, co-founding id Software and making videogames like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Hexen, and Quake, to name a few. </p>



<p>Nowadays, he makes smaller titles at Romero Games. The studio's most recent title was the Mafia-themed turn-based strategy game Empire of Sin, launched in late 2020 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/empire-of-sin-disorganized-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a mixed reception</a>. More recently, John Romero and his fellow developers signed a deal with Microsoft for their next project, but that deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went awry along with the latest Xbox layoffs</a>. The development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not shut down</a>, though, and Romero himself <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/john-romero-we-were-about-midway-through-our-game-1624993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has provided an update to Gamereactor</a> in an interview conducted at San Diego Comic Con Malaga. The game was halfway done, and many publishers are interested in helping with funding.</p>



<p><em>We're still figuring out what we're going to do with our big game. We own the intellectual property, we own the code, we own everything about the game. So, we have a lot of companies that are interested and still working with us on it, because when you develop a game for years and you put in, say, $50 million into a game, if you move and start working with somebody else, they get $50 million for free. So lots of people want to continue working on something, and even if that doesn't happen, you have $50 million worth of assets that you can use to make another thing. So no matter what, you are shortcutting the end of your game, right? To be able to get your game done faster, you already have a lot there already. We were about midway through our game.</em></p>



<p>Here's hoping that John Romero can find a solid publisher to bring the game through the finish line. We've already had more than enough game cancellations for this year, at least as far as I'm concerned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-we%E2%80%99re-now-the-largest-gaming-publisher-and-want-to-be-everywhere-the-real-competitor-is-tiktok.1337845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d8dA8GtE8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a live interview on TBPN</a> (Technology Business Programming Network) discussing various topics, including the company's updated multiplatform strategy on the gaming front.</p>



<p>Nadella pointed out that following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the largest gaming publisher in terms of revenue. The goal, then, is to be everywhere the consumer is, just like with Office. The Microsoft CEO then interestingly referred to TikTok, or, to be more accurate, short-form video as a whole, as the true competitor of gaming.</p>



<p><em>Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business. And of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it. So to us, the way we're thinking about gaming is - first of all, now we're the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore, we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office.</em> <em>We're going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the PC, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>



<p><em>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward. So, I'm very looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly, the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well, because after all, the gaming's competition is not other gaming. Gaming's competition is short form video.</em></p>



<p>The Microsoft CEO clearly refers to the fact that every entertainment bit competes for the user's attention on any given day. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the New York Times</a>, following the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> and all future Halo titles would also launch on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Game Studios president Matt Booty shared a similar comment, mentioning that everything from movies to TikTok constitutes competition nowadays.</p>



<p>During the TBPN interview, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella made another statement that might irk some people in the industry. On one hand, he stressed the need to continuously innovate to keep consumers' attention; on the other, he said that to do that, it is necessary to have 'good margins'.</p>



<p><em>If we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model, right? Best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund.</em></p>



<p>However, it is a tone-deaf statement following the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> that have hit Microsoft as a whole and the gaming divisions specifically in the past couple of years.

<p>Following the deployment of the 1.1.1.0 update in Battlefield 6, Steam players worldwide have been met with a ‘Connection Lost’ error message when trying to access the Battlefield 6 campaign. This has been addressed by Electronic Arts as a known issue, but the team has yet to provide further updates regarding a resolution.</p>



<p>In this snapshot guide, we’ll help you understand the Steam ‘Connection Lost’ error in Battlefield 6, and provide information on how to get around it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-connection-lost-error">How to Fix Connection Lost Error</h2>



<p>If you’re booting Battlefield 6 through Steam and getting a ‘Connection Lost’ error in the campaign, there are a few things you can try to workaround the issue.</p>



<p>First, <strong>restart the game and quit the Steam launcher entirely, rebooting both after a few seconds</strong>. This will clear your sessions and refresh your login to both Steam and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Second, you can try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong>, refreshing your networking connection and resetting your WAN IP to hopefully fix routing issues, if that’s the problem.</p>



<p>If you can, <strong>switch from Wi-Fi to Ethernet </strong>to eliminate any residual issues with internet speed or capabilities. As a rule, gaming is best done with an Ethernet connection, as this offers uninterrupted, unbroken links.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>disable any VPN or proxy services </strong>that you might be using, as this can cause a direct conflict with EA’s systems and servers.</p>



<p>If you want to go <strong>even deeper </strong>with network-related fixes, you can try to change your DNS settings, flush your DNS cache, or even fully reinstall Battlefield 6.</p>
