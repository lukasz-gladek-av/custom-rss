            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-ttrpg-defy-gods-brings-duplicitous-deities-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new fantasy TTRPG campaign, <em>Defy The Gods</em>, created by Chris Sellers, has hit Kickstarter. Players can play as characters vying for power and romance and create the cast of gods conspiring against them.</p>

<h2>The <em>Defy The Gods</em> TTRPG Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hecticelectron/defy-the-gods/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Defy The Gods</em></a>&nbsp; is a sword and sorcery Powered By The Apocalypse TTRPG packed with passionate romance, cursed power, and bold adventure. Its inspirations include <em>Conan</em>, <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=F8qMNEw1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=mkZztUuA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in a fantasy version of ancient Mesopotamia, one you build at the table. its ancient cities, its pantheon of gods, its untamed wilds, its fate in the Underworld, all are made at the table.</p>

<p>In addition, Defy The Gods, is a game about queer love. It is a game of universal visceral attraction. A game where players can win anyone's romantic interest. Alternatively, you can use that attraction to your benefit, using that attraction to distract or thwart them. In this sense, it is similar to another story of queer love, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>.</p>

<p>This queer theming is key to the intended experience of <em>Defy The Gods</em>. This world's pantheon of Gods hates you, and the rulers of the City wish to push your character to the margins. As impressive as your characters are, they will struggle against the forces conspiring against you. Simply living a free life in this context is defiance.</p>

In between adventures, players take on the role of World Forces. These can be City officials or even the gods themselves. In these scenes, players can get the Game Master's imagination rolling with where they want the story to go in these scenes.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for Defy The Gods are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>PDF + POD Edition for $20:</strong> A PDF of the Core Rulebook and a code to print-on-demand an at-cost physical copy of the Core Rulebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Standard Hardcover + PDF for $40:</strong> A 6x9 hardcover copy of the core rulebook and everything in the PDF + POD tier.</li>
	<li><strong>Special Edition Hardcover + PDF for $80:</strong> A special edition Core Rulebook with alternate art by Thalie Shelen, and everything from the PDF + POD tier.</li>
	<li><strong>Daring Rogue Bundle for $90:&nbsp;</strong> Everything from the Standard Hardcover + PDF tier, two cuneiform dice, four sorcery dice, four art postcards, and an enamel pin.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Hearts Bundle for $140:</strong> Everything from the Special Edition Hardcover + PDF tier, two cuneiform dice, four sorcery dice, two unique enamel pins, and four art postcards.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Bundle of Doom for $250:</strong> Everything from the Burning Hearts Bundle, the chance to create a unique character, and joining a three-session game of <em>Defy The Gods</em> GM'd by the creator.</li>
</ul><p>It must be noted that, likely in response to the turbulent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>, shipping costs for the game will billed separately for backers via the pledge manager.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the campaign for <em>Defy The Gods</em> has raised $11,757, which is barely one-quarter of its initial funding goal of $47,000. The campaign concludes May 29.</p>

However, it also made some people worried that a long-in-development fan mod which also aims to recreate the aging RPG would face legal issues or be overshadowed when it arrives later this year. That doesn’t seem to be the case as Bethesda themselves seem very excited for the project. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196903,196742" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On May 1, Bethesda published a new developer spotlight video focused on art and development lead Dan Lee.

		<p>The Age of Bhaarat has been revealed by Tara Gaming Ltd, an Indian gaming studio that is aiming to bring Indian tales to the AAA gaming space. It is a studio comprised of some heavy hitters including Nouredine Abboud, the Founder who has previously worked on Ghost Recon, author of the Shiva Trilogy &amp; Ram Chandra series Amish Tripathi, Studio Manager Siddarth Singh, and legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Age of Bhaarat: Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ec0IJ6Z0vgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Age of Bhaarat takes us to Ancient India and it is a world filled with legends, myths, and monsters. What we know is that players take on the role of a Forest Guardian of Anandpur and they must defend Bhaarat, which is another name for India, from the invasion of the Rakshasa demons. Players will have access to traditional Indian weapons, artifacts, a grapple hook to navigate, and the mystical powers that are imbued within the forest. The landscapes of The Age of Bhaarat are taken from Indian epic tales, with these places open to exploration to learn more about Indian mythology. The game will feature choices for players to make which could tip the scales that will either save the world from the demon invasion, or doom it. You will be able to explore Bhaarat alone or party up and fight together in co-op. Going by the trailer it currently seems limited to two player co-op, but we do not know if that is the final number.</p>
<p>There is currently no release date for The Age of Bhaarat and it is only confirmed for PC at the moment. You can wishlist the game at the following links:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been six long years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since Hollow Knight sequel Silksong was confirmed to be in development</a>, and fans - starved of much in the way of news - have managed to reach such a frenzy of anticipation in that time, it's a wonder the whole thing didn't end in mass spontaneous combustion. Some of the pressure was thankfully released last month when developer Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">finally confirmed a 2025 launch window</a>, but an exact release date remains elusive. What we <em>do</em> now know, however, is Silksong's set to be playable at an Australian museum this September, suggesting it'll either release before, after, or during that time.
</p>
<p>
Silksong is more specifically due to appear at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI) as part of its upcoming <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">Game Worlds exhibition</a>, running from 18th September 2025 to 8th February next year. The exhibition focuses on 30 video games - including the seminal likes of The Sims and World of Warcraft - and "charts technical and design innovation to uncover what makes these virtual worlds feel alive." And in among that number is Silksong, which has earned its place in the line-up partly for the sheer magnitude of anticipation surrounding its release and partly to celebrate its homegrown origins, given Team Cherry is based in Adelaide.
</p>
<p>
"Since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet," Game World co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell wrote in a statement announcing the news, "and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September."

<p>
"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"
</p>
<p>
It is, of course, tempting to try and divine a narrower Silksong release window from this fresh morsal of news, but that ultimately feels like a fruitless endeavour. ACMI's announcement makes no suggestion Silksong's playable Game Worlds appearance is in any way a first, so there's every chance it'll get a general release ahead of its museum debut. On the other hand, it doesn't say it's <em>not</em> a first, so the opposite might also be true? All we know for certain is Silksong comes Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and PC later this year, with an Xbox and PlayStation release to follow.

			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was finally revealed after weeks of leaks, many RPG fans began to worry for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur was a brand-new RPG released just days after the Oblivion remaster, and the concern was that Oblivion would swallow up all the attention from Clair Obscur. On the outside, it looked like Xbox had screwed Clair Obscur in a big way.</p>
<p>That was not the case, as Clair Obscur surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies sold</a> days after its launch, and is one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">best-rated</a> games of 2025 so far.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a> showed that not only did Clair Obscur not get swallowed up by Oblivion, but the two seemingly helped each other. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass, so it's not a surprise that, per Ampere Analysis' data, the majority of players for both Oblivion and Clair Obscur were Xbox players.</p>
<p>What is interesting, though, is that 55% of players who played Clair Obscur on Xbox also played Oblivion. 35% of all Expedition 33 players also played Oblivion, showing huge overlap between the two. As Kelper Interactive's portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told The Game Business, "<em>I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.</em>"</p>
<p>Handrahan also spoke about how Clair Obscur's inclusion in the Xbox's summer showcase ahead of the game's release was a major help.</p>
<p>"<em>[During the Summer Showcase] our game was placed alongside Gears of War, Fable and products that are very traditionally known as AAA products,</em>" Handrahan said.</p>
<p>"<em>It let people understand what it was in a way that I think we would've struggled to do if we weren't allied with Xbox in that way. We couldn’t have done it through a Steam demo alone, for example. It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way. Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers.</em>"</p>
<p>Xbox's support in the showcase is a clear help to Clair Obscur, but it's more interesting and hopeful to see that the shadow drop of such a massive RPG was able to help catapult the release of a new entry to the genre.</p>

            <p>
A frustrating thing I frequently find myself thinking about games is that they very rarely try to be more than what they are, at least when it comes to AAA ones (or any kind of game that has enough money for a full blown ad campaign). They're just so often… games. No interest or desire to expand the medium. Luckily, there are people doing the work to rethink what games are, and today we now have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, a "semi-autobiographical", almost documentary-like game about playing football in Ecuador in 2001.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game follows an eight year old Julián Cordero, one of the lead developers on the game, as he kicks about a football throughout Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Now, I'll be honest, I care about football about as far as I can throw one (it's not very far). That doesn't matter very much to me though because, from the looks of it, Despelote shows a connection to the beautiful game that anyone could get invested in.
</p>
<p>
Kicking around the football is all physics based too, it looks so satisfying just punting it off into the distance. The look of the game is impressive too. It has this filter to it that makes everything look like it's a photo that's been put through one of those free filters that comes with some camera app. I don't mean this derogatorily in any way, there's such a strong sense of texture to it that somehow makes it feel real and surreal at the same time. Exactly my kind of vibe.
</p>
<p>
All of the photos and audio in the game were apparently recorded on location, which is probably why Despelote looks to have such a strong look to it. This is what I'm talking about with expanding the medium. Autobiographical games aren't all too common, it joins works like Cibele and That Dragon Cancer in a very small niche, but I hope that more people consider doing the same.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote on Steam now</a>, and there's even a 10% launch discount until May 15th.

                <p>Microsoft just joined Nintendo in announcing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some of its games will sell for $80</a>, and this new rate will seemingly apply to both physical <em>and </em>digital games. The price hike is inspiring a lot of debate and discussion, with some wondering why the price of digital games is going up. Many might be able to understand why a disc-based product might go up in price due to tariffs and other market factors, but why would digital games get more expensive, too?</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1917978011661713905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's true there is no "direct" tariff impact on digital games, but publishers may choose to raise prices anyway for a variety of reasons. To begin with, raising the price of a digital product could help offset rising costs in other departments, he said. Second, a publisher might raise the price of a digital game to bring it in line with its physical counterpart.</p><p>Other factors could be that a game's price is going up to reflect the increased cost to develop a particular game, along with a belief that people will, in general, accept the price increase. Lastly, a publisher might decide to charge more for a digital game "because they can," Ahmad said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo announced that it would sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> would sell for $80, for both its physical and digital edition. Not every Nintendo game will carry the heftier price tag, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a> is priced at $70.</p><p>Microsoft announced on May 1 that it is raising the price of some games to $80 later this year, with price hikes on consoles going into effect immediately, making one version of the Xbox Series X more expensive than the PS5 Pro. Microsoft hasn't published a list of its $80 games yet, but the company did say <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> is not getting a price hike, too, at least not yet.</p><p>Now, many are wondering if Sony will follow suit with an announcement of increased costs for its consoles and games.</p><p>New AAA video games sold for $60 for years before Take-Two was among the first to raise prices to $70 in 2020. The company said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-coming-take-two-sees-no-pushback-on-70-games/1100-6514323/" data-ref-id="1100-6514323">"no pushback" at the time over the higher price</a>, and $70 later became the standard for Take-Two and others. According to one analyst, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">hope in the video game industry that Take-Two will charge $100 for GTA 6</a> to help reinvigorate the video game industry. As of yet, however, Take-Two has not announced pricing plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>.</p><p>For comparison, GTA 5 launched at $60 back in 2013. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about $82 in 2025.</p><p>Outside market conditions and development costs, Microsoft is staying rather vague about suddenly raising the prices for so many Xbox products. It's possibly related to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">new Trump administration tariffs in the US, because they led to Switch 2 preorder delays</a> and eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/-/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">some price hikes.</a> </p><p>Microsoft, for its part, is raising prices <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the company overall generates huge amounts of money</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announced-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-surpassed-2-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced today that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, its 2D action platformer from the Ubisoft Montpellier team, has gone "<em>well over</em>" 2 million players since it launched at the top of 2024.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1917609908024856659">X</a>, Ubisoft announced the milestone with a short message that ended with what could be read as a hint that there's more to come regarding The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>"<em>Well over 2M players by now</em>," the post began. "<em>You've revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up.</em>"</p>
<p>That could hint that there's more to come related to The Lost Crown, but that feels unlikely because <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">Ubisoft disbanded the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that made The Lost Crown</a>. More likely, the tease is referring to the fact that there are other Prince of Persia games in the works, like the ongoing development of the early access game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was rebooted partway through development.</p>
<p>Sure, Ubisoft could try to get the Montpellier team back together. It certainly wouldn't be the first time the executive branch of a big game publisher/developer went back on a decision everyone and their mother could have told them was poor and short-sighted. If that's what's happening, then great! But it doesn't feel likely.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was undoubtedly Ubisoft's best game of 2024. Just because it didn't meet Ubisoft's sales expectations doesn't mean it wasn't a success. It had the best critical reception of any game Ubisoft released in 2024 and was one of the best games released in 2024, period.</p>
<p>Ubisoft could have taken the win of The Lost Crown being regarded as one of the best games they'd made in a long time, and focused on helping that team succeed again. Instead, they scattered that team to the wind, adding to the very public mess that Ubisoft continues to find itself in.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Ubisoft does not hold the Prince of Persia series in the same regard as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. If it did, Prince of Persia would also be part of that <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">new holding company</a>. Considering what happened with The Lost Crown, fans of the storied series have no reassurance from Ubisoft that they should actually be excited for whatever is next with the Prince of Persia series.</p>

Some of these are achieved by combining abilities and status effects from other characters, such as using Mei’s freezing ability to emulate Luna Snow’s, while others are made by assigning different damage/healing values and hitboxes to abilities through the workshop. This means you’ll see a lot of assets you’ve probably never seen in typical <em>Overwatch</em>, but the end result is that you can basically play <em>Marvel Rivals </em>inside <em>Overwatch 2</em>. You can check out Javofo’s breakdown below:</p><p>It sometimes feels like <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s workshop modes go overlooked, but there’s some truly creative stuff to be found there. Not that the game is lacking in new creative stuff right now. The season 16 update added a new Stadium mode that allows you to craft a hero’s build over the course of seven rounds, and it’s given the game some new life as players find new ways to approach playing old characters. That’s kind of been Blizzard’s M.O. these past few seasons; the new Perks system, introduced a few months ago, allows you to upgrade characters in the middle of a match with big and small tweaks to their kits, giving players more freedom than they’ve had in this game for a hot minute. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has felt pretty restrictive over the years, and it seems like Blizzard is finally loosening its grip on the leash. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of them is a new way to level characters that sounds like a more story-driven version of Chromie Time. By speaking to Lorewalker Cho in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, or Dornogal starting in patch 11.1.7, players can complete three repeatable quest chains containing both old and new quests from previous expansions but that share a common story thread. One quest chain, for example, dives into the history of iconic Warcraft villain Arthas, where players will be able to battle through Strathholme during the culling before jumping to the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion and stepping into the shoes of Arthas himself. Another questline dives into the history of current main villain Xal'atath, as players experience her origins in Legion, how she regained her physical form in Battle for Azeroth, and a past confrontation between her and the Old Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate much on the new Lorewalker Cho quests, but it seems a great way to keep new or returning players up to date on plot threads that are currently relevant, with Xal'atath's origins, and another quest chain involving the Ethereals, being perfect examples. Why Arthas and the Lich King are featured prominently with a questline despite having no real connection to The War Within's events is anyone's guess. Perhaps the Lich King still has some role to play, or more likely Blizzard simply knows Arthas is one of the game's most enduring characters. Presumably, max-level characters can also experience these quest chains for a lore refresher, though what rewards they might contain is currently unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">Another surprise is the introduction of Overcharged Delves, more dangerous versions of six specific Delves that will feature more traps and enemies, as well a new trait tree specific to these amped up versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">WoW's solo dungeons</a>. Blizzard will additionally be adding Battle for Azeroth dungeons to the game's Timewalking lineup as part of the return of the Turbulent Timeways event, complete with a new Battle for Azeroth Timewalking vendor.</p><p dir="ltr">While it will be coming sometime after the patch's launch, Blizzard also detailed the return of its Diablo-themed Greedy Emissary event that sees players hunting down Treasure Goblins for rare loot. This time the loot will be even more desirable, as there will be a new mount and recolors of WoW's recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">remastered tier 2 armor sets</a> that players will definitely want to collect.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 will additionally bring UI improvements in the form of the recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">revealed Combat Assistant</a>. This feature when enabled will mimic the behavior of popular rotation assistance add-ons by displaying which ability a player should use next for optimal damage, but goes a step further by including a single-button rotation option that will automatically cast abilities in sequence. It's just the latest way Blizzard is looking to bring add-on functionality into WoW's base UI, with its most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-april-22-update-will-finally-offer-an-easy-alternative-to-a-critical-ui-add-on/1100-6530701/" data-ref-id="1100-6530701">recent patch introducing a Cooldown Manager</a> meant to replace the popular WeakAuras add-on.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: The War Within patch 11.1.7 doesn't have a release date yet but is now available for testing on the game's public test realm.</p>

			<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year, it came out of nowhere and immediately captured the attention of role-playing game enthusiasts. With traditional party-based role-playing games finding less and less representation in the AAA space, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive looked like the game that could bring the genre into the spotlight without being a nostalgia-fueled experience, as the setting, story and main cast of characters looked very unique, and far removed from those we are now used to see in similar games. In the end, the game's dark fantasy Belle Époque setting, the members of Expedition 33, and the turn-based combat system with a twist weren't just a fluke meant to lure in jaded fans of classic RPGs. They are the well-developed elements that make up one of the best role-playing games released recently.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425004620_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 is set in a ruined world where the mysterious goddess known as the Paintress holds sway over the people of the isolated island of Lumière, a beautiful place inspired by Paris, which broke off from the rest of the Continent following the Fracture. For the past 67 years, the inhabitants of the island have been subject to the Gommage, a twisted ritual where the Paintress draws a decreasing number, which causes the death of every human with an age above that number. To stop the Paintress from decimating humanity, the people of Lumière send expeditions into the continent, which often end in ruin, but not before they manage to leave behind something that could be for those that will come after.</p>
<p>Following yet another Gommage where the Paintress painted the number 33, the members of Expedition 33 head over to the Continent, hoping to achieve what the previous Expeditions couldn't. Unfortunately, the group is decimated as soon as it lands on the continent by a mysterious man who has evidently lived well past 33 years. The few survivors, who include the engineer Gustave, his foster sister Maelle, the scholar Lune, and the warrior Sciel, following protocol, continue nonetheless towards their objective, not knowing that the world dominated by the Paintress and the Gommage is a lot more complicated than they initially thought.</p>
<p>The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's setting and story have been influenced by NieR Automata, with its ruined world inhabited by some rather unique creatures, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3, with humans whose life has a set duration dictated by some higher power, but even so, they are fascinating and engaging. Much of the enjoyment of the game's story, which manages to convincingly alternate between world-building, intimate character development, fist-pumping epic confrontations, mystery, and heartbreaking tragedies, comes from the excellent pacing that somewhat reminded me of what I consider the best-paced role-playing games ever made: Chrono Trigger.</p>
<p>Like the Square Enix classic, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 doesn't inflate the play time. Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425014015_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in role-playing games in a long time.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of classic franchises like the Final Fantasy series, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 plays a lot like a traditional Japanese role-playing game, although with many twists that make both exploration and combat extremely engaging. Of the core gameplay elements, exploration and traversal are the most straightforward. Controlling characters from a third-person perspective, players explore a variety of locations scattered all over the world map, featuring multiple paths to the location's main objective, usually an intense boss battle, filled with secrets to discover, shortcuts, and so on. The game doesn't feature any navigational pointers or location maps, which makes exploring more immersive and organic than similar games, though some sort of navigational pointer would have been welcome.</p>
<p>Unlike most modern role-playing games developed in Japan and those inspired by them, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also features a proper world map, much like each location, filled with optional locations and secrets to discover. At the very start of the adventure, the game feels a little too linear with little to do other than go from one main story location to the next, but after only a few hours in, the game opens up, providing players with plenty of opportunities to unlock new content such as outfits and hairstyles for all characters, additional weapons with different elemental properties and passive skills, Pictos to customize their abilities, and take down more Nevrons roaming the map. On the main world map and inside locations, enemies are visible and generally very easy to avoid, which is a definite plus, as random encounters tend to impact the experience negatively if not appropriately handled.</p>
<p>Though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based combat system doesn't appear to be much different from any other similar system, Sandfall Interactive has done an incredible job making it highly engaging and satisfying within the boundaries of the classic mechanics. Except for regular attacks with the equipped weapons, items, and a few skills, every combat action requires some involvement from the player besides selecting the command. Almost every skill, of which every character can equip up to six, comes with a simple QTE event that, once cleared correctly, increases its efficacy. It's during defensive actions, however, that clearing QTE becomes more important, as the game offers multiple defensive options that expand as the adventure proceeds, which are more or less effective depending on the situation and the enemy. Dodging attacks is the easiest option that doesn't offer too many rewards besides negating all damage; parrying, on the other hand, is more challenging to pull off consistently, but it's infinetly more rewarding, as characters that parry attacks not only negate any damage, but also restore AP, which are used to perform the aforementioned skills, and Aim attacks, which can be customized to deal status effects alongside damage and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427131135_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if all characters played the same in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, these mechanics would have been more than enough to make each battle thrilling and exciting, but the developer went the extra mile to give each one of the playable characters some very unique playstyles. Gustave, for example, accumulates charges for his mechanical arm, which can be then used once charged to deal massive damage and stun enemies if the Break gauge has been filled; Maelle, to make another, can enter three different stances that grant offense and defense bonuses and can enhance the effects of specific skills; Lune acquires Essences when using her elemental spells, which can be consumed to enhance the effects of every spell.</p>
<p>Each character's unique playstyle includes a massive selection of skills learned via individual Skill Trees that further define how each character is played, in conjunction with the passive abilities learned via Pictos, which are incredibly varied and can enhance pretty much every aspect of a character both offensively and defensively, and even the order in which each character attacks. Verso, to make an example, is extremely good at restoring his own AP, and has skills that allow him to act twice in a turn, and restore the AP of the other party members, so the other party members skill loadout can be built around this mechanic with powerful skills that require a lot of AP.</p>
<p>Sciel, whose unique Foretell mechanics make her extremely powerful, has a skill that can stack Foretell on multiple enemies if they are afflicted by Burn, so building the party around this skill can be highly effective. The game is filled to the brim with these options, and even a single playthrough may not be enough to discover all of them, something that lends extremely well to the extensive endgame and New Game Plus, which offer additional challenges beyond Expert difficulty, which, by itself, is pretty challenging even on a first playthrough, requiring perfect execution of the defensive options to clear even regular enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's intriguing setting and charming characters are made even more so by the game's visuals. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game emnploys all the core rendering techniques offered by the engine like Lumen and Nanite - to deliver dense environments with a clear visual identity, tons of detail and generally accurate lighting, though some imperfections creep in now and then, and bloom is maybe a little excessive at times. Character models look as good as the environment, if not even better, thanks to some great animations (especially facial ones) that make each character strikingly believable, even with the average lip-syncing on display. Taking full advantage of all the above are the masterfully directed cutscenes, with a high-quality level that wouldn't look amiss in a proper movie or TV show.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427133400_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though games powered by Unreal Engine 5 usually suffer from considerable performance issues on PC, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is among the few that don't, at least not massively. On the system used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and Epic settings, the game ran at an average of 61 FPS, 24 FPS 1% low during a benchmark session held on the world map and the Monoco's Station and Frozen Hearts locations which feature tons of particle effects, complete with some battles. Things fared slightly better turning down every setting to High, as in the same scenario, the game ran at an average of 75 FPS, 28 FPS 1% low with minimal differences in visual quality. During traversal, I experienced minimal stuttering, and the most noticeable drops happened during combat, thankfully not when the enemy was about to attack my party, so generally they weren't too bothersome.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Quality, Epic Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJtfNqJNxXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even more than visuals, the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack and voice acting are top-notch. The adventure's main theme, which is woven into multiple tracks, is immediately recognizable and sets the melancholic tone of the adventure incredibly well. That is not to say that the entirety of the soundtrack is composed of sad, haunting pieces influenced by the NieR series soundtracks, as there are some surprisingly upbeat and catchy tunes, like the Gestral Beach themes, that are difficult to resist tapping a foot in time with. Likewise, while playing the game with the French voice acting makes for a more authentic experience, given the game's setting, the quality of the English voice acting is, as already mentioned, stellar. Every voice actor clearly poured their hearts into their performance, often surpassing everything they have done before bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</p>

<h2>End of an era</h2>
<p>Polygon was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/polygon-com-its-a-website.1185405/">founded in 2012</a> when Vox Media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/">spent significant money</a> to poach top journalists from popular gaming blogs like Kotaku, Joystiq, and The Escapist. After initially publishing as the Gaming section of Vox.com for a few months, the Polygon domain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/24/3547938/welcome-to-polygon">launched</a> alongside <a href="https://botherer.org/2012/08/23/polygon-and-the-documentary-that-cured-cancer/">a series of flashy videos</a> hyping up the staff's lofty goals for video game journalism.</p>
<p>In the years since, Polygon has become a respected source for news and views on the gaming and entertainment industries—one that Ars Technica has cited frequently during my tenure as senior gaming editor.</p>
<p>"Just completely sickened by this news," Polygon cofounder Brian Crecente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crecente.bsky.social/post/3lo4nrllxuc25">shared on Bluesky</a>. "Mostly for those so suddenly and deeply impacted, but also for the dwindling number of publications seriously covering video games."</p>
<p>New Polygon owner Valnet publishes dozens of Internet content brands<span>, which collectively have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.valnetinc.com/en/screen-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 260 million page views</a></span>. But the publisher, founded by Pornhub co-founder Hassan Youssef, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">has earned something of a reputation</a> over the years for exploitative work conditions and quick-churn, clickbait content. One contributor to Valnet-owned Collider <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">told The Wrap</a> last year that the site runs as "a content mill, borderline like almost sweatshop-level," with writers "constantly being pushed to write more, to do it quicker."</p>
<p>"We’re proud to have built Polygon into the gaming authority for both experts and casual fans alike, a publication that has informed and delighted tens of millions of gaming enthusiasts since its founding at Vox Media more than a decade ago," Vox Media co-founder, chair, and CEO Jim Bankoff <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">said in a statement</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's strategy of releasing first-party Xbox games on PlayStation looks to be working, as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced during its Q3 FY25 earnings call that the company was recently the top publisher on the PlayStation Store when it came to preorders.</p><p dir="ltr">The period Nadella referred to was January through March 2025, when he said Microsoft ended the quarter as the top publisher by preorders and preinstalls on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Other stats Nadella highlighted included news that PC Game Pass revenue was up 45% year-over-year, and that while Xbox hardware revenue declined 6% over the previous year, it saw gaming revenue increase 5% and Xbox content and services revenue increase by 8%. Those numbers were thanks to growth in Xbox Game Pass, Call of Duty, and Minecraft, Nadella said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what Xbox games available on PlayStation led to so many preorders, Microsoft had several big titles set to release shortly after the time period Nadella cited. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-indiana-jones-was-the-weeks-top-seller-but-it-wasnt-in-the-top-15-most-played/1100-6531178/" data-ref-id="1100-6531178">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle released April 17 and became the best-selling PS5 game</a> for that week (even if it wasn't in the top 15 most-played games). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-performance-on-ps5-pro-is-a-compromise-free-experience-experts-says/1100-6531102/" data-ref-id="1100-6531102">Forza Horizon 5 released for PS5</a> shortly after on April 29 (or on April 25 for those who bought the premium edition). Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, set for release on May 15, is likely also driving preorders for Microsoft on Sony's platform.</p><p dir="ltr">While Nadella didn't mention it during the investor call, Microsoft the following day announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">sweeping price increases for Xbox consoles</a>, accessories, and games. All Xbox Series consoles, including the Series X, saw price jumps of up to $100, while controller prices increased between $5 and $10. Microsoft additionally announced select first-party games will cost $80 starting this holiday season, but did not name specific titles.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Microsoft, the price hikes were made with "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development."</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft didn't cite recently enacted US tariffs as the specific reason for the price increases, but it wouldn't be the first video game publisher affected. Nintendo delayed Switch 2 preorders in order to assess the impact tariffs might have, announcing several weeks later it would increase the price of Switch 2 accessories (but not the console itself, at least at launch) due to "market conditions."</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in May, and this month celebrates May The 4th with some Star Wars games, brings one of Xbox'ss top shooters, and delivers an indie darling that recreates the feelings of late-'90s Internet culture.</p><p>As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" rel="nofollow ">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>With May The 4th approaching at the beginning of the month, there is plenty of Star Wars representation in the first batch of free Prime Gaming titles. Both Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga will be available on the first week of the month, and each offers a unique gateway to fun Star Wars action--Galactic Battlegrounds for the real-time-strategy fans, and Lego Star Wars for those looking for something silly and lighthearted.</p><p>Outside of Star Wars, one of the marquee games on this month's free lineup is Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. You'll be able to get ready for the Doom Slayer's next adventure by leading his canonical great-great-grandfather B.J. Blazkowicz take on the Nazis in an alternate version of America.</p><p>If you're looking for something you've never played before, Hypnospace Outlaw will certainly fit the bill: It simulates the Internet of the late 1990s, as you try to surf the web in order to solve mysteries and thwart criminals from wreaking havoc on the World Wide Web. Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell, meanwhile, features an entire musical number in the middle of the game, and that alone is worth checking the Saints Row sidestory out for yourself.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for May 2025</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Styx: Master of Shadows [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">The Invisible Hand [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 8</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Digital Deluxe Edition [Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: Rebirth [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Hypnospace Outlaw [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Doors - Paradox [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 15</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Saints Row: Gat out of Hell [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Legend Definitive Edition [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Golf with Your Friends [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Mail Time [GOG Code]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 22</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Fate [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Thief 2: The Metal Age [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Everdream Valley [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Chessarama [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">The Lost Ashford Ring [Legacy Games Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Samurai Bringer [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 29</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Trinity Fusion [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Masterplan Tycoon [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Liberté [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Jennifer Wilde Unlikely Revolutionaries [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to play the following games in May via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars III - The Clone Wars</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga</li><li dir="ltr">Disney Planes</li><li dir="ltr">Death Stranding Director's Cut</li><li dir="ltr">Lawn Mowing Simulator: Landmark Edition</li><li dir="ltr">House of Golf 2</li><li dir="ltr">RiMS Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Haven</li><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Pinball</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite OG</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Ballistic</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Festival</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li dir="ltr">Rocket Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite</li><li dir="ltr">Trackmania Starter Access</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

            <p>
Somehow we've made it to May already, and with the month of maypoles, mayflies, mayflowers, and mayonnaise upon us, it means there's fresh batch of Prime Gaming offerings for members to enjoy - which this time includes a smattering of Star Wars, Nazi-pummelling in Wolfenstein 2, orifice-clenching horror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/amnesia-rebirth">Amnesia: Rebirth</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Prime Gaming's May titles arrive across four scheduled content drops, and Amazon's first batch of games is available to claim right now. It's here we get a little May the Fourth, with Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga and Lego Star Wars — The Complete Saga, both in the initial line-up. That's alongside some old-school goblin stealth in Styx: Master of Shadow and a bit of satirical stock trading simulation in The Invisible Hand.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the days pass and May goes from fresh-faced to increasingly wrinkled, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to the likes of MachineGames' very excellent alternate history shooter Wolfenstein 2, Amplitude's stellar fantasy 4X Endless Legend (which arrives in its all-encompassing Definitive Edition form), horror maestro Frictional Games' Algeria-set Amnesia: Rebirth, and wonderfully oddball 90s internet simulator Hypnospace Outlaw. Plus, we get more dark fantasy action in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> 2 and some classic stealth with Thief 2.

The company is announcing the changes less than a day after a major court ruling that mandates that Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how they point to off-platform payments, meaning that more developers may choose to direct users to other payment options.</p><p>Beginning in June, Epic says that for any payments processed via the Epic Games Store, developers will pay a zero percent revenue share – meaning developers themselves will keep all of their revenue – “on their first $1,000,000 in revenue per app per year,” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">according to a blog post</a>. After that, Epic’s typical 88 / 12 percent revenue share will kick in. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars">Google</a> offer a lowered commission rate on sales below $1 million, too, but only to 15 percent versus Epic’s zero. </p><p>Also beginning in June, Epic will launch a new feature that lets developers launch Epic Games Store-hosted “webshops.” These webshops “can offer players out-of-app purchases as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees,” Epic says.</p><p>To incentivize buying things from webshops, Epic says that player spending will accrue 5 percent Epic Rewards “on all their purchases.” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/features/epic-rewards">Epic Rewards</a> can be applied to future purchases from Epic’s store.</p><div><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">ruling last night</a>, CEO Tim Sweeney also announced that Epic plans to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">US iOS App Store next week</a>.

            <p>
You know, at this point I'm not sure if games, or even just aspects of games, that rely on licensing other works, is really all that good of an idea. It's probably part of why there are some Fortnite skins you never see in the shop anymore, it's absolutely why the Friday the 13th game shut down, and I have a hunch that that's what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>. Recently, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game disappeared from both the PlayStation Store and Epic Games Store, leading to a bit of confusion as to its status. Now, the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> have put out a comment addressing the situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," wrote Saber in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam post</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
My guess is that despite only being a three year old game, it hasn't done well enough to keep it going, and something related to licensing out the Evil Dead universe has fallen through. I honestly can't tell you, and I doubt Saber will confirm anything, so your guess is as good as mine. None of this is surprising though, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-dead-the-game-studio-halts-development-of-new-content-just-16-months-after-launch-but-servers-will-stay-up-for-now">new content for the game was stopped back in 2023</a>, only 16 months after the game launched.
</p>
<p>
The fact that servers are still being kept online is a welcome surprise, but ultimately the game's death warrant has been signed. Obviously the irony of a game with the word dead in its title dying like this isn't lost on me. You don't need to post your witty "Evil Dead game" comments, I'm one step ahead of you.

He and Michet said that in a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, helping players understand those systems-driven escalating incidents starts with good old-fashioned warning labels... the kind many people ignore in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most objects in the game have a warning label of some sort that can be viewed by holding down the "shift" key or a controller button. Deodorant boxes, for instance, have a warning explicitly calling out their flammability. It's a quick way to introduce what he called "cartoon logic" not seen in other games in the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Labels like these are unusual for the immersive sim genre, which usually put players in the roles of spies and assassins in hostile environments. Players are usually briefly introduced to separate game systems and then expected to discover other interactions on their own. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s labels also aren't necessarily "realistic," often taking up excessive physical space on the object in question, again hewing closer to cartoon logic over real-world logic.</span></p><p>Image via Blendo Games/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to be pretty forgiving," Chung said when referencing the myriad interactions, saying Blendo's goal was for players to find the consequences of their actions more "interesting than painful." For instance, the game cuts off the risk of explosive decompression by letting the player character breathe in outer space. If they get blown out a window, the guards will likely just think they're dead while they circle around to find an airlock.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mario-kart-world-features-missions-for-the-first-time-in-20-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mario Kart World features missions for the first time in 20 years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chung said that this kind of "Looney Tunes"-style thinking helped the Blendo team design the myriad interactions, because it turns out players are more familiar with cartoon logic than you might think. "People have an understanding of how things work with exaggerated physics," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before you expect players to embrace the full ethos of the Acme Corporation, be aware that you've got to keep the Rube-Goldberg machine in check.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The game was too chaotic for a while&quot;">"The game was too chaotic for a while"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chain reactions and surreal setting of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be a lot to take in, and according to Michet, the biggest challenge of finishing the game was that for a while, it was just "too chaotic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything is systemic," added Chung. "An issue that we had for a while was when anything happened, it caused a Rube-Goldberg chain reaction of events to [take place], and then the chain reaction went on for so long that at the end of the chain, it was just completely incomprehensible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players might toss an object in one room and minutes later, find a dead guard a guard in another room, with zero context for what caused their untimely demise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One way this reigned in was through extremely obvious "signposting." When players knock down a guard, the game freeze-frames to show the precise object interaction that incapacitated them. Toss a lighter at a leaking fuel vent, and when the guard goes down, the game freezes, letterboxes pop up, and they'll see arrows pointing to both the lighter and the vent. If they shoot a guard and a bullet does them in, it will only label the bullet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, the Blendo team cooked up an "event log" that kept a longer record of the interactions leading to that freeze-frame moment. There are two versions of that log in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. One is visible to the player, and one kept invisible for all but the developers. The visible one can be seen in full while the game is paused, but a short record of recent events pops up in the player's view as they navigate the space. It's useful for more subtle interactions, like if a player drops a can, and a guard hears the noise, but the player doesn't hear the bark playing due to another audio cue.</span></p><p>Image via Blendo Games/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the second version of the log is reserved for Chung, Michet, and the collaborators. There are an intense number of subtle interactions that the player doesn't need to know about, but the Blendo team would for bugfixing. Michet said the events shown in the simplified log were filtered by studying what was "actionable" for the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally—sometimes you just have to tell your game "hey, the party's over."
