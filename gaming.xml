Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>Hulst said Sony now has a "much more rigorous process" in place for "validating" the company's hypotheses as it relates to a game's creative and commercial possibilities.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p><p>Marathon is slated for release on September 23. Some theorized it could be delayed, but it remains on track, at least as of now.</p><p>In regards to Sony's live-service plans in general, Hulst said the company is "very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live-service portfolio."</p><p>In related news, it was confirmed this week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-off-30-of-days-gone-developer-bend-studio-after-canceling-live-service-game/1100-6532332/" data-ref-id="1100-6532332">Sony cut staff at the studio behind Days Gone after cancelling a live-service game at the studio.</a> Before this, Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service God of War title</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">developer Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online</a> back in 2023.

			<p>PlayStation executives <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_01_ja/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in a fireside chat with investors earlier today. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino talked about the platform's future, as reported in this article, while Hermen Hulst, who now heads the Studio Business Group but reports to Nishino <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-leadership-changes-again-nishino-takes-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the latest shuffle</a>, talked about Sony's commitment to making and maintaining live service games following early successes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>) and failures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>). On that note, Hulst said that while much work went into Concord, the game launched into a hyper-competitive segment and was not unique enough to stand apart. Needless to say, the goal is to avoid repeating the same mistakes with PlayStation's next big live service launch, Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We remain very committed to building a diverse and resilient live service portfolio. We have MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2. These are really good examples of the type of titles that we're looking to develop. These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres. Together, that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category. I would say that, additionally, we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve if we get everything right. That game has been a true breakout success. It's been attracting and retaining a significant community. This ongoing success is further evidenced in how we deal with the monetization, as microtransactions now make more than half of that game's revenue. We're also very excited about Marathon's anticipated launch in this fiscal year.</em></p>
<p><em>With live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us, but with that great opportunity, there are some unique challenges associated. We've talked about the early success with Helldivers 2, but we also faced some challenges with the release of Concord. I think that some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately, that title entered a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. We have reviewed our processes to ensure that we're not going to make those mistakes again. We have introduced much more rigorous processes for validating our creative, commercial, and development assumptions, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>That plan will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines. For Marathon, it's our goal to release a very bold, very innovative and deeply engaging title. It's going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade, so we are really excited for that release. Going through the test cycle, we're monitoring the Closed Alpha that the team have just gone through. We're taking all the lessons learned and we're using the capabilities we've built to understand how audiences are engaging with the title. Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But that's super useful; that's why you do this testing. When launch comes, we're going to give the title the optimal chance at success. This cycle of test, iterate, test again, it's such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game.</em></p>
<p>Marathon, an extraction first-person shooter game based on the old Bungie franchise, will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on September 23 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-white-guardian-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced the release date for upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">all the way back in September last year</a>, will be launching across PS5, Switch, and PC on September 26th. It doesn't appear that a native Switch 2 port will be available at launch, at the very least.</p>

<p><em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will serve as a followup to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">released last year as a free-to-play RPG</a>. Unlike its predecessor, however, this new game won't be an online-based gacha RPG, but instead a fully-fledged&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=U-Qq1I7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=9PYlGqeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>&nbsp;aims to fuse familiar&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>elements with new, experimental features. It'll stand in contrast to&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, which, as Koei Tecmo says, "aimed to create the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">rather successfully, it should be noted</a>).</p>

<p>The new game takes place in the fallen town of Hallfein, which has been devastated by a "mysterious disaster" that "caused most of its residents to disappear". After some time, however, two former residents of Hallfein, Rias and Slade, return to the town to discover the truth of what really happened.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will also feature characters from previous&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games.

                <p>Earlier this year, Hideo Kojima admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/" data-ref-id="1100-6531555">he felt conflicted about the positive reception</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> received from game testers. At the time, Kojima said that he doesn't want to make blockbusters that "need an 80% approval rating" and preferred to remain controversial. Now, Kojima has revisited his comments and explained why he wants a divisive response from players.</p><p>While speaking through his interpreter, Kojima Productions' Aki Saito, Kojima told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOygCKsTMP0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Informer</a> that the reason he doesn't want a blockbuster is because those are the kind of games that are easily forgotten. Instead, he wants Death Stranding 2 to withstand the test of time over the next few decades.</p>

      </div>
<p>"Recently, all the entertainment things are like easy to chew, easy to digest," explained Kojima. "But with Death Stranding, I thought it needs people who love it, and people who don't love it because it's a new thing. It's the same as Metal Gear. It took 10 years until Metal Gear was recognized as a good game. For Death Stranding 2, when I tested it, it wasn't like that. Everyone liked it. That's why I said, 'Maybe this is a problem.' It was more [liked] than my prediction."</p><p>Although Kojima has acknowledged leaving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-he-has-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-his-studio-to-use-after-he-dies/1100-6531577/" data-ref-id="1100-6531577">a USB stick full of his ideas for video games</a> for use after his death, he recently indicated that he doesn't want his successors at Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-doesnt-want-his-company-to-imitate-him-after-hes-gone/1100-6532356/" data-ref-id="1100-6532356">to simply make games the way he made them</a>. He feels that the company would fail if it takes that approach.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is hitting PlayStation 5 on June 26. After that game, Kojima's next titles are the Xbox-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and the spy-action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>. Kojima is also working with A24 on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-be-a-new-dimension-of-what-a-game-adaptation-can-be/1100-6528061/" data-ref-id="1100-6528061">Death Stranding movie</a> and planning to potentially direct his own original film.</p>

Paradox Soul made its debut in 2018, and it's yours for the taking if you grab it fast.</p><p>Paradox Soul was developed by Ritual Games and published on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/610570/Paradox_Soul/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> by GrabTheGames. The story is set in Iceland in 1987 and it places players in control of Dr. Alli Rose, a research scientist who is exploring a test facility filled with secrets and deadly robot enemies to fight. Much like many of the older video game titles, Paradox Soul's game art doesn't closely resemble the graphics used in the actual gameplay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7sih3hYxQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cZ7sih3hYxQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Physically, Alli is an ordinary woman, but she can collect suits in the game that upgrade her offensive capabilities, including a Samus Aran-like ball form that Alli can use to attack her foes. The game's description also teases "terrifyingly epic boss fights" and a "hand-crafted labyrinth of evil."</p><p>Paradox Soul has been released on consoles and it's currently on sale for $1 on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0891-CUSA15807_00-RATGAPARADOXSOUL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSN</a>, and available on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as well. But you can only get it for free on Steam through June 17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156755/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> feels like the culmination of everything Hazelight Studios has accomplished in the co-op space.</p>
<p>The journey began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brothers_a_tale_of_two_sons">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a>, a charming fantasy that required solo players to coordinate both thumbs to control two characters simultaneously. The studio then progressed to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/a_way_out">A Way Out</a>, a jailbreak caper that introduced several clever mechanics for two players, including the now-standard Friend's Pass system (more on that later). With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Hazelight pushed things even further, delivering a big adventure with a well-written, emotionally resonant story and great characters.</p>
<p>Now comes Split Fiction, a near-flawless dual odyssey that perfects the studio's formula and delivers an epic experience of staggering variety. The game’s many co-op trials might put your strongest relationships to the test, but you will never stop having fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156750/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The story is, fittingly, about stories. Mio and Zoe are two aspiring writers lured to the shady tech giant Rader Publishing by the promise of a no-strings book deal. Upon arrival, they’re suited up in <strong>Tron</strong>-like bodysuits and instructed to enter a set of strange, floating bubbles. Mio hesitates and, after a brief struggle, ends up inside Zoe’s bubble. They awaken inside the physical manifestation of their combined imagination. The two unlikely companions must survive their own ideas, while trying to stop Rader from stealing their IP.</p>
<p>The adventure unfolds across two vastly different mindscapes, built from the main characters' chosen theme. Mio’s choice of fiction is cyberpunk-style sci-fi, while Zoe prefers cosy fantasy. These contrasting settings give Hazelight the perfect excuse to drop partners into dramatically different environments that demand teamwork, creative problem solving, and synchronised playstyles.</p>
<p>At its heart, Split Fiction thrives on this collision of two distinct genres, using the stylistic clash as a narrative engine to drive inventive cooperative gameplay. The plot is built to sustain momentum; Mio and Zoe are constantly plunged into tense, in-media-res scenarios that keep the action moving and the players engaged.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156759/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>After a brief introduction at Rader Corp, our deuteragonists are thrown straight into chaos, first piloting a spaceship in a frantic battle, then fleeing from a horde of giant ogres. Soon after, they’re swinging across the rooftop of a futuristic nightclub and bouncing around as a pair of pigs in a (surprisingly dark) fairytale scenario. This all happens in the opening chapter.</p>
<p>Each world is packed with elaborate set pieces, and the action rarely lets up. Mio and Zoe leap from one high-energy scenario to the next, pausing only occasionally for charming, character-driven moments that deepen their bond. Slowly bringing these two contrasting archetypes together in the middle of all this action is a storytelling masterstroke, one that pays off in the game's phenomenal final act.</p>
<p>So, what do you actually do in Split Fiction? What genre is it? The answer, quite simply, is all of them. It’s a puzzle game, a shooter, a brawler, and a platformer, sometimes all within the same level. Across its lengthy main story, there’s a little bit of everything. This grab-bag format means that you have a consistent grasp on what you will have to do next.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156748/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The only drawback is that, by its very nature, the game doesn't linger on any one activity for long. That’s unfortunate, because many of its ideas are strong enough to support a full game on their own.</p>
<p>Each chapter grants the aspiring writers a unique ability, and most of the level’s progression is built around using that power in creative ways. Often, both players are required to perform different tasks simultaneously, making strong communication and patience essential. These challenges never feel overwhelming, and the game’s generous checkpoint system ensures that frustration is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>There are still moments that will really test the patience of you and your partner. Faster-paced sequences, like high-speed chases or boss fights, are often hilarious exercises in trial and error.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156752/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What makes Split Fiction exceptional is the sheer variety of challenges you face. There are hundreds of mechanically distinct minigames spread across this adventure and every single one feels thoughtfully crafted. Alongside the linear main story, optional side quests offer wild artistic swings and some of the most difficult activities in the game.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of this solid Switch 2 port is that it's a nice showcase of the console's capabilities, with the exception of mouse control, which is unfortunately missing.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks great. This is a gorgeous game, with a vibrant art style and busy environments that often move at breakneck speeds. Performance remains stable throughout, with a locked 30fps that has only the slightest of stumbles in handheld mode for some of the bigger set pieces. It would be nice to have 60fps, but it runs incredibly well with the lower frame rate.</p>
<p>The big feature here is the Friend's Pass system. Like previous Hazelight titles, two separate consoles can share a single copy of the game. This time, too, you can use Switch 2 and Nintendo’s GameShare feature to host a session that an original Switch can join. This not only offers incredible value but also ensures that co-op partners who don’t own the new console aren’t left out. As it's running from the host console and not an installed version of the game, the performance on the OG Switch can be a tad unpredictable, but it's mostly steady.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156747/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside GameShare — and the option to play local splitscreen and online — there’s also crossplay, so there’s a generous number of ways to play with others.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is a singular experience, one that you'll want to jump right back into after the credits roll. It's the crowning achievement of Hazelight, a studio whose every release is becoming a notable event. It's also a great time on Switch 2 and ranks among the very best of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">the launch lineup</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Split Fiction feels like a gift. Its sole aim is to entertain and bring players together by testing them at every turn. Hazelight gives us two distinct worlds, each filled with a huge array of activities for co-op partners to enjoy and argue over. It serves as a surprising visual showcase for the Switch 2 and enhances the Friend's Pass feature, allowing our original Switch buddies to join in the fun.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/escape-academy-2-preview-puzzles-within-puzzles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{11}" paraid="1549716025"><em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School</em> is everything you would want in a sequel. It’s bigger in scope, addresses its faults, and digs into what made the first one work even more.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{11}" paraid="1549716025">A Story and Characters Full of Intrigue</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{25}" paraid="706658818"><em>Escape Academy 2</em> takes place after the first game, with you returning to school as the hero of the first game that everyone knows. Of course, that means you’re understood to be a master puzzler and will challenged as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">Getting to know the academy, its professors, the founders, and the overarching lore of where the game is set will be important this time around, too. It’s not that you’ll need intimate knowledge of it all, but there will be puzzles that use that information.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">There's hints at some sneaky business going on as well. I mean, they are professors of an insane academy to teach people how to escape elaborate puzzles. They have to be up to something.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{61}" paraid="516747078">Moreover, there will be more context given to any one puzzle. Why am I in this one particular reason beyond solving a puzzle? The developers want players to be engaged more beyond "hey solve this problem we’ve put in front of you." In other words, they're hoping for some investment beyond the nature of the puzzle itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{73}" paraid="1391258185">They’ve taken a different approach to the escape room aspect as well. The first game featured a lot of countdowns and timers to ratchet up the tension as you tried to solve the puzzle to any one room.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">While <em>Escape Academy 2</em> will still feature that sometimes, like in the introductory classroom you must escape, they are much fewer and far between. The developers told us that they received a lot of feedback that people wanted more time to just figure out puzzles. The stress a timer put on everything just wasn't something they were looking for.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">Escape Academy 2 Goes Open World Puzzling</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{87}" paraid="2061573449">To that end, there are two different sets of puzzles and problems to solve. Many will be the classic, here’s a thing to figure out in this specific room. All the information and objects you’ll need will be found there.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">The big change in <em>Escape Academy 2</em> is that there will be some “open world” puzzling to get involved with as well. You’ll have the Academy to explore, which is of course full of many secrets to uncover. In my brief time with the game, it was hard not to look at every little detail or furnishing and not assume it was relevant to some puzzle somewhere.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">Of course, progressing through the open world is gained by solving puzzles as well. That may be figuring out a certain puzzle in a hallway that then leads a nearby student to give you a key card as thanks, or something more. You'll need to gain access to new areas through solving things in the world.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{155}" paraid="2132570097">As for the puzzles themselves, what I saw in my short time with the demo was really cool. Nothing was frustrating, I never felt like the information I needed was too far away, nor was there any of the moon logic nonsense some people worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Solving puzzles was always satisfying, and the pacing was impeccable. I was always just around the corner on some sort of breakthrough while I was maybe collecting some more problems to solve. It felt like I was always making progress even with the conveyer belt of puzzles heading right for me.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Awesome Visual Puzzle Design</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{173}" paraid="994646972">Also, so many of them were wonderfully designed visually. It’s hard to not give away too much without explaining, but I wanted to give one pretty cool example.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">I had to solve a few different puzzles to open up a large set of bookcases, but those gave me access to a series of books I could pull out or leave in. The puzzle was to figure out which books to pull out to let a beam of light either travel through it or be reflected off a mirror. I could see the titles of the books and had found a scrap of paper that told me what kinds of books to pull out, like removing the books that rhyme with "rocks", for example.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">While doing this, I wasn't quite sure what the beam of light would do or if it was just getting to some end goal. As I went further along, it became more apparent that the beam started to form giant numbers that I needed to input as a code to unlock something else in the room. It was a great reveal that I didn't see coming immediately but was so satisfying to see the finished product.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">The most impressive part to me, however, was just how screwing up the books I pulled out could cause the light beam to line up in such a way that it made a different number. It wasn't simply just a bunch of screwed up lines, though it could be that at times too.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">My short time with <em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School</em> was a wonderful time. I was engaged the whole time and the puzzles were so satisfying to solve. With a bit of a surge in puzzle games thanks to the likes of Blue Prince and others, I think people should keep an eye on this one.</p>

<hr><p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473"><em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School </em>was previewed at Summer Game Fest.</p>

The company has recently announced, ahead of the start of the third season of the best of all those shows, <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, that it’s to get a fourth <em>and</em> a fifth season too! Woo! Although that fifth run will be truncated, and be its last. Boo!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197583" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="197583,197582,197580" data-current="197583"><div><p>Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23104.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The experiments in the final frontier have had mixed results over the last decade. Beginning with the very promising <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> in 2017, the long-abandoned television franchise returned from a 12-year hiatus since the (merciful) demise of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise </em>in 2005—a period that had otherwise only been populated by J. J. Abrams aimless and soon-abandoned reboot movies. This was then followed in 2020 by <em>Picard</em>, quickly accompanied by animated comedy <em>Lower Decks</em>, kids animation <em>Prodigy</em> in 2021, and then in 2022 the beginning of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.</p><p>Now, clearly making judgement on anything <em>Star Trek</em> is a surefire way to get a person in all manner of trouble, but who cares: <em>Discovery</em>’s five seasons offered diminishing returns, its fourth series reaching a nadir of utter dreadfulness that was only mildly improved upon in its fifth meandering final run. <em>Picard</em> was so excruciatingly bad as to have been ruled illegal under the Geneva Convention, although its third and final season—while still rubbish—delivered joyfully silly fan-service as it reunited as much of the <em>The Next Generation</em> crew as would agree to stagger onto set. <em>Lower Decks</em> was utterly brilliant for five glorious years and you should watch it immediately. No one, not even the people who wrote and drew it, watched <em>Prodigy</em>. And <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has made the entire roller coaster worthwhile.</p><p>The mistake both <em>Discovery</em> and <em>Picard</em> made was to believe <em>Star Trek</em> was ever supposed to be more than people in pastel colors exchanging sci-fi gobbledegook, blowing up a spaceship, and then learning a jolly nice lesson in time for the credits. Presumably attempts to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle moments from the earlier series, like “The Best of Both Worlds” or “In The Pale Moonlight,” they failed to understand these only worked <em>because</em> they stood out from the usual amiable chatter. Both series just felt morose, hopeless, and as such, distinctly un-Trek.</p><p><em>Strange New Worlds</em> (and <em>Lower Decks</em> for that matter) understands the brief. Set before the events of the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> TV show (well, in between the events of the pilot and the rest of the series, nerds), it span off from one of <em>Discovery</em>’s finer moments, as we see Captain Pike faced with a vision of a gruesome accident that would ruin his life. But, put that aside, because now we’re off to enjoy the voyages of the Starship Enterprise before Kirk gets into the captain’s chair, and it’s going to be so much fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The previous two seasons of <em>Strange New Worlds </em>have brought us some of the best <em>Star Trek </em>ever. It’s bright, and positive, and features an incredibly capable crew driven to be a force of good in the galaxy. They are very much on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no humans have gone before. And if that means getting trapped in a fairy tale, or a space creature causing the entire crew to communicate in musical numbers, then dammit they’ll do that so flipping well. And they’ll do it with impeccable haircuts.</p><p>As such, when things do get more serious, they’re mostly earned, and you know aren’t going to end in inescapable doom. (Although, let’s be fair, S02E10's “Hegemony” was an embarrassing miss in its attempt to suddenly turn into <em>Alien</em>.) So, it is with absolute delight that I greet the news that Paramount is letting it serve its full five-year mission.</p><p>It’s vanishingly rare for any TV series, let alone streaming ones, to get guaranteed episodes for a further two seasons in advance. It means that on top of season three’s 10 episodes, we’re promised another 10 for season four, followed by an abbreviated six-episode run for season five. And yes, admittedly, the 26 episodes this assures us of is the same number as a single-season order for <em>Trek</em> in the 90s, but times have changed, and honestly, I’m grateful we get <em>any</em>.</p><p>Also, while I’d love the idea of the show running for as long as the cast and writers are willing, it does make a lot of sense to give <em>SNW</em> a termination date. As much as the joy of things as daft as seeing cartoon characters from <em>Lower Decks</em> appear in this live-action show distracts us, the reality is we <em>are</em> heading toward Pike’s accident, determined not only by his earlier vision, but also by August 23, 1969's episode of <em>Star Trek</em>, when the disfigured post-accident Pike appeared, sealing his fate some 56 years ago. They can’t keep putting it off forever.</p><p>But, we’ve got a solid 20 episodes before we need to worry about any of that! And the trailer for the new season, which starts July 17, suggests it’s going to be fun times. Including Patton Oswalt as a Vulcan! And, thank goodness, it doesn’t look like Nurse Chapel is going anywhere.</p><p>It’s all on Paramount Plus, which can more conveniently be accessed through Amazon Prime, along with all the episodes of the other mentioned shows. But honestly, just watch this and <em>Lower Decks</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony president Hideaki Nishino has stated the company is open to adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability".</p>
<p>The comments come as <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">part of a discussion</a> between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p>

<p>This statement, while not an indication that a price increase is necessarily on the cards, is essentially stating Sony will ensure the service will prioritise profitability going forward. Indeed it's a statement Sony has been aligned with for some time, given the spread of price increases PS Plus has received over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-price-hike-announced-for-europe">There was a European price hike back in 2017</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-getting-global-price-increase-from-september">2023 PS Plus saw a global price increase</a>, which Sony justified by stating it could "continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PS Plus subscription service" as a result.</p>
<p>In the accompanying presentation, Hideaki noted some key shifts in PS Plus profitability over recent years. In 2024, 22 percent of PS Plus subscribers were paying for the most expensive PS Plus Premium, compared to 17 percent back in 2022.</p>
<p>PS Plus Extra, the next in terms of price-per-month, also saw an increase in subscribers, rising to 16 percent of subscribers compared with 13 percent back in 2022. In addition, in 2024 PS Plus made up 14 percent of total PlayStation revenue, an increase of only one percent from 2022.</p>
<p>What we can glean from these statistics is that while overall growth for PS Plus as a service remains slow, those who are subscribed are gradually forking out the cash for the pricier tiers.</p>
<p>Whether this is due to these subscribers increasingly believing the increased price point is worth it for the selection of games provided, a shift in attitude in favour of subscription services like PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, or some alternative cause remains an interesting point of discussion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-plus-should-be-used-to-manage-the-lifecycle-of-a-game">former head of PlayStation Shuhei Yoshida stated that services like PS Plus should be used to extend the life cycle of games</a>, and that the company still believed in premium games getting a standard release at launch. Maybe this approach has resulted in growth for PS Plus over the years?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a4e4c23e4d38/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is finally out, making it the first proper new mainline entry in over a decade. Chances are if you've bought a Switch 2, then you've probably bought Mario Kart World too, so we're eager to see exactly what you make of it so far.</p>
<p>Before we do, however, let's just remind ourselves of what we thought. Alana provided the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">big review</a> for the game and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At first, this doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart that people wanted or expected, but the more time you spend in the open world and racing with friends, you’ll uncover a mechanically rich kart racer full of secrets and joy. Mario Kart World refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Few games have brought me as much laughter as Mario Kart World has done since launch. If you need a pick-me-up, this game is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like a perfect start to Switch 2's life."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749821814 -->
<p>At the time of writing, Mario Kart World is currently sitting at 87 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/">Metacritic</a>, which means that it's currently viewed as 'generally favourable' from a total of 75 critic reviews.</p>
<p>So now it's over to you. While we think it's unlikely you've completed 100% of the game with every possible secret uncovered, we imagine you've probably experienced all of the tracks by this point and have a solid understanding of the its many quirks.</p>
<p>Still, your chosen score isn't written in stone. Feel free to give it a preliminary verdict now and revisit at a later date. Alternatively, you can always come back here if you feel you simply can't provide a score just yet. So cast your verdict in the below poll and let us know exactly what you think of Mario Kart World after just over one week.</p>

<figure><a title="delivery driver throws switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f6d199b6a5f9/delivery-driver-throws-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's a hectic old time, is this new console business. There are new games, new hardware, new bits and bobs of every description to read up on, buy and, if you're a delivery driver, to get safely from warehouse to customers' homes. Of course, not all delivery drivers are built the same or employ the same techniques to ensure that your goods — in this case a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, apparently — arrive as they should.</p>
<p>For us, regardless of the package, well, we would assume most would adopt a fairly routine method of walking right up to the door and handing it over to whoever lives there, who in this case is likely waiting for a shot on Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/delivery_man_throws_my_nintendo_switch_2/">as seen on u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one gamer has apparently captured — via the magic of the humble doorbell camera — a delivery man using an entirely new method.</p>

<p>New skill unlocked! As you can see in the clip above, this particular technique involves throwing the parcel (hopefully they got some bubble wrap in there) in the general direction of a house.</p>
<p>This particular shot didn't make it all the way to the door, although it did fairly well. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Happily, the poster also confirms <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/comment/mxfporg">a little down the comments</a> underneath their video that the Switch 2 was, box aside, quite remarkably fine!</p>

<p>A happy ending.</p>

<p>FBC: Firebreak is set to release later this month, on 17th June. It will throw players back into the halls of Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, letting them revisit a number of familiar locations from that game but with a fresh multiplayer twist.</p>

<p>Following its initial launch, the studio will then release a major update this autumn. This will include a new Job, codenamed Outbreak, and a new Jobsite: the Research Sector. Players will also find new gameplay systems and enemies, new free earnable rewards, and new (paid) Classified Requisitions. These will include unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Winter will then bring in a second major update. Again, this will add a new Job to FBC: Firebreak, with this one codenamed Blackout. There will also be a new Jobsite, but for now where that is located is a mystery. Along with the new Job and Jobsite, this update will also add new equipment and enemies, new free earnable rewards and new (paid) Classified Requisitions, including unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">Remedy's communications director Thomas Puha</a> said the team also has plans afoot for 2026, but the team wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing".</p>

<p>Our Chris went hands-on with FBC: Firebreak earlier this year, when he called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>. "It might be coming together somewhat at the last, but again, perhaps that's exactly the way these kinds of games need to work."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the worst things is when you see potential and promise in something, but it doesn’t reach the heights you know it can. That is probably the best way to describe my experience with Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon, the dark fantasy open world RPG which uses the King Arthur legend as the basis for the setting and story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon begins strongly. You are a no-name character who is suffering from disease and is locked up on Asylum Island. You are freed by a mysterious character, but they do not help guide you to freedom, instead leaving you to figure out the path through the dangers for yourself.</p>


<p>It is only as you are broken out that you actually create your character, answering questions about what you were doing prior to ending up in the cell. Answering these questions feeds into which attributes get a boost at the beginning, and the playstyle you are considering. At the start you are weak, and Tainted Grail does an excellent job of showing just how that works as different enemy types cross your path and you are almost helpless to beat them, requiring quick thinking or running away.</p>
<p>Once you are away from Asylum Island and the first proper area, Horns of the South, things really do open up. There is the main quest to follow, which involves recovering some of King Arthur’s relics to restore his soul. Arthur’s soul just so happens to be in your body as a passenger and allows you to access various powers and abilities. You can also talk to him at bonfires and get his story, which comes in fragments since his memory is tied to the artifacts.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon has a lot of side quests and content within the world too. Many of the quests are pretty well put together and a few have some interesting and fun ways to resolve them, provided you meet the skill checks. You can tell the team have put the effort in to write some entertaining characters too, and the acting is decent too though not quite top tier.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon gives you some decent combat options. You can choose to use a sword and shield, dual wield weapons or spells, and combine them so you have a melee weapon in one hand and magic spells in the other. You can also put a few different combinations together so you can switch between quickly. For my playthrough I regularly used spell and sword, with two different combos. One allowed me to summon creatures while dealing heavy damage, while another featured a sword that had life steal and a spell that also stole health from enemies, which can be unstoppable at times.</p>
<p>The efficiency of your spells, weapons, armour are all linked to your attributes. As you level up you will get points to upgrade your attributes, be it physical, perception, spirituality, dexterity, and more, providing a baseline of stats to go alongside skills that you unlock in relation to these categories. Early on you can experiment, but as time goes on you should start focusing on a playstyle to really take full advantage. However, if you get bored of a particular style you can use an Origin potion to reset your points.</p>

<p>There’s something distinctly Oblivion to the visual style of Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon – the original, I mean, and not the remake. There is a good amount of things to discover within the world to discover, such as with dungeons that are hidden in plain sight. The Horns of the South is full of ruins showing how it has been ignored by Kamelot, while the second area of Cunacht has the show of somewhere falling apart as Kamelot tries to move everyone while locals want to stay. However, there is a clear quality divide between these regions, where Horns of the South just feels far more detailed in comparison to Cunacht.&nbsp;It gives a sense that Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is quite front loaded.</p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon’s technical issues cannot be ignored, despite the regular patches that are being released. The game crashes multiple times, which can be triggered by moving from one place to another, or for some non-obvious reason. There is flickering in the environment that is distracting. There is also a bit of a weird issue when swimming where even if it looks like you are underwater, the oxygen bar doesn’t appear. On occasion, my summons did not engage with enemies or got stuck. Luckily, you can resummon so that is not a big deal, but you would still want it to be better.</p>

<p>How does it hold up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Given the improved specs in the recently released Switch 2, it's not entirely surprising that the system's battery can't quite keep up with its predecessor's (though with the increased size, one has to imagine that Nintendo could stuff a bigger one in there). But just how good / bad is it?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Alex has put it through its paces to see exactly how long it's likely to last with a variety of different games. To start, he sat down and played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> until the battery died completely, going from 100% right down to 0%. This lasted for just over 2 hours and 10 minutes, though it's important to note that Mario Kart World is a flagship title for the console.</p>
<p>When testing other games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, the battery ranges from just over 2 hours to around 5 and a half (though these are rough estimates based on how much battery percentage is lost over a 20-minute session).</p>
<p>So all in all, the Switch 2's battery is about what you'd expect from a console of this calibre, putting it in line with other powerful handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally.</p>
<p>We're hopeful Nintendo might provide updated models later down the line with improved battery life, but for now, this is about as good as we're going to get.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>sales have hit the 10 million mark. As usual when it comes to sales figures, these numbers apply across all platforms on which the game is available, and they apply to both physical and digital sales as well.</p>

<p>As for the reason behind the game's strong sales performance, Capcom cites its "exceptional gameplay experience", as well as "efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of video games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/devil-may-cry-5-sales-10m-nero.jpg?itok=Ye_Twk9K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/devil-may-cry-5-sales-10m-nero.jpg?itok=_4R-fP3_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom says&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>'s "exhilarating" gameplay is part of the reason for its success.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom is referring here to the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">debuted on Netflix in April</a>. According to the studio,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>attracted over 5.3 million views in its first week, as well as garnering critical acclaim worldwide. The show has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">already been renewed for a second season</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fifth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which began on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it's the latest mainline entry in the franchise, and it features three core playable characters across its campaign: series mainstay Dante,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 4&nbsp;</em>newcomer Nero, and V, a mysterious individual with the ability to command monsters.</p>

<p>In a post-launch update, Capcom also added Dante's brother Vergil to the mix as another playable character; it's possible to play as him throughout&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>'s campaign, as well as its Bloody Palace and The Void modes.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/601150/Devil_May_Cry_5/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/devil-may-cry-5/BNLG5J5KDVJ3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/devil-may-cry-5-review-devil-trigger-crybaby" rel="nofollow">thought of it here</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, put your hands on the table. Please. I won't ask again. Thank you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">arrived on PC</a> as of June 11th, and naturally that's brought a new lease of life the the modding community who'd only had a demo to play with up until that point. Around 40% of the game's mods over on the Nexus right now are a bit risqué, so we've done you a favour and picked out the three filthiest on offer.</p>
<p>Don't feel you have to thank us. Well, me. This is all part of the job description, alongside all of the holding power to account and providing a service to the consumer stuff. Odds are my Pulitzer's already in the post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Okay, you ready? Having searched through the 222 Stellar Blade works <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/stellarblade/mods?sort=downloads&amp;adultContent=false">on Nexus Mods</a> as of writing, I isolated the 90 tagged as 'adult', and calculated that those numbers meant the racy, lecherous, and bawdy stuff made up exactly 40.54% of the total. Then, my instincts kicked in. I began a search for the naughtiest of the naughty, the hardcore horniness-inducers. I found three things.</p>
<p>First of all, and promise me you'll remain calm, I found the work of modder WTails358. I present to you, dear reader, their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/11">Casual Wear</a>. As you'll see if you click that link after making sure there are no kids or people with pacemakers nearby, this utterly smutty mod clothes Eve in an incredibly chic autumnal turtleneck-style jumper with a dragon design on it.</p>
<p>That sumptuous garment, which tastefully bares her midriff, is paired with delightfully retro chunky trousers that form the perfect constrast via their bright porcelain hue. Completing the look are a striking aquatically-themed belt buckle in gold, and a pair of understated boots that combine practicality with high fashion. Reader, just breathe, I know your temperature's rising with every word, but you must maintain control.</p>
<p>If you're alright to continue, I'll introduce you to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/60">Formal Wear</a>. Steady now. Take deep breaths. I know, it's an elegant suit and tie combo that allows Eve to cut an equally striking and refined figure that'd look at home on any of the catwalks in Milan or Paris. C'est magnifique, especially twinned with the rounded spectacles that cast Eve as a shrewd, sharp individual who knows what good vintage burgundy tastes like. Phwoar indeed.
</p>
<p>However, you mustn't get carried away, because I have one more totally pornographic mod to show you. It's modder Tenshiken1's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/90?tab=description">Thomas the Tank Engine replacer</a> for the stalker boss. Oh no. You've blown your whistle. You'vre chugged along the tracks and let out a deep, lustful choo-choo. I hope you're proud of yourself. What would Sir Topham Hat think?</p>
<p>Well, at least you've got time to ruminate on your failings and appreciate the non-jiggly things in life while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shift-up-essentially-confirm-stellar-blade-2-is-in-the-works-havent-revealed-how-revealing-it-will-be">more info from Shift Up</a> about Stellar Blade 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marvel was ascending into superhero supremacy, but Warner Bros. had a goal to bring Batman back onto the big screen. After two good films, the then-up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan was chosen to helm Batman’s return to the movies. Along with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, these Batman films would take the influences of Michael Mann’s crime films and political thrillers to move the superhero into the post-9/11 world we were living in at the time.</p><p> Christian Bale portrayed this new version of Bruce Wayne, which showed his transformation into Batman from start to finish, including the classic characters he encounters during his missions to protect Gotham. It’s been twenty years since <em>Batman Begins’</em> broad gothic epic of an origin story ushered in a new era of gritty and grounded superhero movies. From that beginning to <em>The Dark Knight</em> ending with real-life-inspired class conflict cataclysm, these ten unforgettable characters had the most profound impact on Bruce Wayne, Batman, and Gotham City itself. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-recommend-id="image://04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1598" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

But for the story and the audience’s reaction to seeing Tommy “Tiny” Lister’s huge, imposing presence on the screen as a handcuffed prisoner, he perfectly plays on our preconceived notions of a bad guy. It’s Deebo from <em>Friday</em>, man. In <em>Dark Knight’s</em> epic ferry scene, the Joker (Heath Ledger) rigs two separate ferries with explosives, one holding citizens and one holding prisoners, and places each ferry’s detonator on the opposite boat. He wanted to show Batman that the citizens of Gotham aren’t worth saving because they’d kill each other to save themselves.</p><p> No one saw that ingenious plan being shattered not by a good, upright, working citizen but by this criminal who took it upon himself to do what the police and the citizens on the boats couldn’t. He was the one who knew the only choice was to choose life over the false choice of “survival.” Batman’s speech to the Joker after the boats in Gotham Harbor fail to explode is due to someone who could be on the opposing side of the Dark Knight. Did Batman inspire this person to make this choice, or did even the lowest in Gotham have enough moral and ethical standards and community with everyone in Gotham to inspire Batman from falling to the Joker’s nihilistic outlook and continuing to protect the city? </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-recommend-id="image://e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="680" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Besides <em>Batman Begins</em>, each appearance was a surprise to the audience. Jonathan Crane exploits the many factions in the city to see people overcome with fear because he gets off on it. He even joins Bane’s (Tom Hardy) autocratic government judging the wealthy and the state in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. You see early on how Batman utilizes his own fears as a tool and engine for his crusade for justice and protection of the people. That head-on conflict with Scarecrow embodies this internal triumph, illustrating how it’s an ongoing battle for all of us to overcome our fears.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-recommend-id="image://0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-format="webp" data-width="1405" data-height="695" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

His whole purpose in <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is to show Bruce that he’s washed, he doesn’t have it like he used to, and that he can’t just come back from retirement. Even Alfred’s (Michael Caine) plea for Bruce to not face him early in the film feels like Mickey pleading with Rocky not to fight Lang at a similar point in that film. Rocky jokes aside, Bane’s false class savior is an excellent foil for Bruce (and Gotham) to overcome in order to finally save the city from the mistakes he and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) made after the events of Joker’s (Health Ledger) reign of terror and Harvey Dent’s (Aaron Eckhart) fall from grace.</p><p>Bane is the manifestation of those lies coming home to roost, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests in real life; it plays with the idea of a rich billionaire taking it upon himself to decide the best for the city while others have less. Should Bruce have become a costumed adventurer? Was stopping that crusade the right path for everyone in Gotham? Hardy’s performance also sold the transition from the monster-heel luchador look of the comics to a captivating European populist terrorist, which has become iconic in its own right.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-recommend-id="image://fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This Selina, more inspired by Frank Miller’s retooling of <em>Batman: Year One</em>, has shed the mystical cat powers from Tim Burton’s film adaptation and evolved into a more grounded, lower-class Robin Hood-style figure from modern comics. Another character bringing class disparity and a different inspiration for Bruce to suit back up after retirement, Selina opens his eyes to the world in a much different way than his usual allies have.</p><p> Through her, he gains an actual voice from the poor and lower-class citizens of the city, as well as from individuals who commit crimes out of necessity due to a lack of options rather than grand plots or a desire to exploit the Gotham citizenry. She comes into his life and reignites his drive to help Gotham, which had been dormant since the loss of Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal). Her perspective, much like Dawes’s, forces Bruce to come to terms with the fact that he’s not doing enough for the people of the city, even if he thinks his boogeyman persona is enough to let the police, politicians, and his fellow rich folks decide, at the cost of so many under them. There is, of course, attraction and the usual cat-and-mouse chase we want and expect from Batman and Catwoman, with Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale having the right chemistry to pull off this duo.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-recommend-id="image://67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

She’s a character who knows Bruce the best, outside of Alfred, and possesses the moral center and dedication to not only justice but also to Gotham. She’s an inspiration for Bruce’s journey, just as much as seeing those bats in the cave. Rachel is a person Bruce loves and trusts so much that he trusts her with his identity from the moment he creates it.</p><p> This love for Rachel is one thing that separates Nolan’s Batman from other interpretations; as much as he wants to protect the city and make it better, he also doesn’t want to be the Caped Crusader forever because he wishes to be with her and have a life beyond being the city’s protector. Her desire to also fight crime as a prosecutor, and her relationship with Dent, beautifully complicates the story of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. With Joker targeting both Rachel and Dent, it threatens Bruce’s hopes and, in turn, destroys his goals. His only choice is to sacrifice Batman’s reputation to save the city. She was his north star, and her loss caused our gritty hero to cease being Gotham’s savior.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-recommend-id="image://d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This version of Fox is much of a mentor-like character, someone who can call Bruce on his mess and also show him some things he might not know. As a man who knew Bruce’s father, he’s one of the three father figures in the orphan hero’s heroic journey to save an embodiment of the 21st-century American city. While not similar to the comics, having Lucius Fox work with Bruce to create the physical persona of Batman by utilizing unused Wayne Enterprises technology also gives the billionaire vigilante a James Bond-esque relationship. By the end, the student becomes the master as Bruce finally fixes something that Fox couldn’t, giving their mentor/mentee dynamic a fulfilling closing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-recommend-id="image://f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

That was a campaign slogan that meant more than just running for District Attorney; it was the heart of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Harvey Dent is more of a damsel than Rachel Dawes. He loved her, and she loves him, but her goal is to protect him. She introduced him to Bruce because of her belief in what Dent could do for Gotham and its people. He fought corrupt police; he went after organized crime; he went out and inspired Gotham. Bruce thinks&nbsp;he can stop being Batman, and can pass the responsibility of looking after Gotham to someone like Dent.</p><p> Just as Bruce sees what he sees, Joker sees it as well and that little bit of darkness there. With just one bad day, Joker can destroy that hope, and he cunningly got just what he wanted – to make Harvey like him and not Batman. From that point, Dent’s submission to his darkest side puts the reluctant hero in a despair that he doesn’t escape until his back is broken by Bane halfway through <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. While Gotham survived, that hope it had at the beginning of <em>The Dark Knight</em> is gone, and so is eventually Bruce. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-recommend-id="image://3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It is an interpretation that, when first seen in a picture, initially received negative feedback. But now, all that has essentially been erased from reality, as if no one had ever had a negative thing to say about it. Heath Ledger’s Joker reinterpreted this character for a new era in our culture, and this Joker, not much different than other versions at its core, was perfect for this Michael Mann crime film-inspired world of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It was an interpretation that changed the way the Oscars work. This take on the Joker is one of the first times I recall a superhero movie where people argue that the Joker is right.</p><p> From his messy makeup to his dark jokes about his scars he uses to scare people, the Joker is something Bruce just doesn’t understand, even with constant advice from Alfred. The Joker’s terrorism in Gotham shakes everyone to their core, from citizens and the government to even the criminals, as he attacks the soul of Gotham to prove his nihilistic views of the world.</p><p> The Joker attacks what is in this film the heart of the city—Harvey Dent—and shatters Batman’s hope. Batman loses in this film; while the Joker is stopped, he ultimately achieves his goals in the end. It wasn’t Batman who proved the Joker wrong – it was a convict. Batman and Gordon had lied to everyone so that the city wouldn’t fall apart, and in the end, Batman had to become the villain to the public. It’s rare to see Batman lose, but with the Joker, it’s the only time it ever makes sense. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-recommend-id="image://5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

He’s the only police officer Batman ever truly trusts. Gordon, at times, works almost like a point-of-view character for the audience as he navigates being an honest cop in a corrupt city, where he must deal with some of his own people he can’t trust. Yet he trusts Batman through each major event that befalls the city, from poisoned water to the Joker and then losing control of the city to a madman while being left for dead by the federal government. Yet it’s the trust that Bruce has in him, as the policeman who was there for him on the night his parents were murdered and helped keep alive that small flame of faith in the goodness of people and justice, that helps lead Bruce to become Batman. His loyalty to Batman remains even through the flawed plan of the Dent Act. The climax of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> makes their connection apparent to Gordon as he finally discovers who Batman is and just how his simple act of being there for a child helped save the city and many lives.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-recommend-id="image://175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

First, having Michael Caine play the classic character completely changed how you viewed Alfred. He wasn’t the stereotypical image of the English butler with the tuxedo and the little mustache and bald head that brings Bruce soup and can also perform an oil change on the Batmobile. Changing his backstory to that of a former soldier changed how this character has been adapted ever since. Also, Caine is just cool, and he brings that coolness to Alfred as he advises Bruce on his new journey to protect Gotham through his own means. He has stories and experiences to call upon that inform each film. From the soldier who threw away jewels and wanted to see the world burn to his pitch-perfect read on Bane, he is there to tell Bruce the truth no matter what.</p><p> He reminds Bruce of his father’s lesson in the first film: “Why do we fall, Master Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.” He’s constantly there in many ways to remind Bruce and the audience of that lesson, as it’s not just for Bruce but for all of Gotham. Their falling out in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is literally heartbreaking, featuring some of the most emotionally resonant performances in the entire trilogy. With the end of the trilogy focused on Alfred seeing Bruce living out the future he wanted for him, Nolan’s Batman canon achieves an ending that no other version of Batman gets to have – happiness. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual Sony business presentation</a>, CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games, which includes the unreleased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fairgames">Fairgames</a>.

<p>Hulst stated that Sony is building on the successes of games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> for future projects, adding: "We look forward to showcasing our progress with Marathon", a game that has seen no shortage of controversy recently.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2, the large jewel in Sony's live service crown, was dubbed a "resounding critical and commercial success" by Hulst, who highlighted both its ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">retain a passionate community</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win industry awards</a>.</p>

<p>Hulst called Marathon "innovative and bold". No other compliments were offered to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, though the accompanying slide noted "strong early engagement" as its prime achievement so far.</p>
<p>An interesting perspective to be sure, at least as far as Marathon is concerned. While much of what Hulst said about Helldivers 2 is true - the game has managed to remain a fantastic success story for the industry giant - Marathon has found itself on the receiving end of some exceptional problems.</p>
<p>The "strong early engagement" noted in the presentation doesn't reflect the available player figures for the games' closed alpha. During this short-lived test, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1k9fob3/marathon_has_lost_roughly_80_of_its_playerbase/">Marathon shed roughly 80 percent of its initial alpha playerbase</a>. As far as engagement via discussion, Marathon's many problems dominated the conversation, such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/04/it-may-be-too-late-to-fix-marathons-core-problem/">its locked three-player format and lack of feasible solo mode</a>, repetitive nature, lack of crucial extraction shooter features such as proximity voice, and more.</p>
<p>One of the biggest merits of Marathon was its aesthetic, which soon soured due to an art plagiarism scandal. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to the use of external art in the games development process</a>, blaming it on a former employee and committing to a full audit of in-game assets in order to remove any stolen work. This situation would reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">send morale at Bungie into "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>Then we have Fairgames, which hasn't been shown off much since its initial reveal. A co-operative heist game, it was recently delayed due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">studio founder Jade Raymond departing for greener pastures</a>. This came following worrying external tests, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">according to a report from Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>According to Raymond in a 2022 <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">Gamesindustry.biz</a> article, "more than 30 percent of the studio is currently working on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based dev tools", technology that has proven divisive in recent years. Not to mention what could possibly be the most devastating hit to Fairgames yet: the removal of the dollar sign from its title.</p>
<p>It is clear that, despite uncertainty surrounding Sony's upcoming live service releases, the company wishes to remain entrenched in the space. Or, at the very least, to appear confident in its continued presence in the world of live service. It's worth noting the full record of Sony's venture into live service, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">the legendary blunder Concord</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled live service God of War project</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">The Last of Us Online</a>, and more. Sony, which initially wanted to release 12 live service games by March 2026, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">has cut that figure down to six</a>.</p>
<p>Sony's single-player output however has proven a far better offering for PlayStation fans. Earlier in this presentation, Hulst highlighted releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>. Describing such releases as "a core strength" for Sony, it appears as though this style of game has proven more successful overall for the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature">promised earlier this year</a>, Valve have given Steam developers the power to tag their games as having certain accessibility features, including narrated game menus, ways of differentiating visual elements that don't rely on colour, and touch-only interaction. You'll now be able to search for games with these tags, and view the full list of accessibility features on each game's Steam page.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update is based on feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, according to Valve. Participating devs can make use of the system by means of a software wizard - ah, I find it vaguely comforting that people still call this kind of program a "wizard" - which walks them through each accessibility category. Valve say that "over 5000 applications" have already made use of the new tags.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games," they note <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500575275933763410">in a blog post</a>. "We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>The new accessibility tags are broadly divided into "visual", "audio", "gameplay" and "input". The "gameplay" bracket includes "adjustable difficulty" and "save anytime", while under "visual" we find options like "camera comfort", which lets players "adjust or disable uncomfortable camera movement such as screen shaking, camera bob, or motion blur".</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">full breakdown on Steamworks</a>, including Valve's notes on why each option is important to players.</p>
<p>The selection of taggable features could probably do with some expansion, and the FAQ descriptions themselves are rather brief and broad. When the accessibility tags were announced in April, accessibility-focussed website Can I Play That <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested</a> that Valve should base their system on the existing <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Games Initiative</a>, which aims to standardise accessibility tagging across every game store, to avoid confusing players.</p>
<p>"According to the list in the documentation there is a lot of overlap, and it's mostly Steam that is missing a few tags," Can I Play That wrote. "Steam's version also uses some different names and descriptions. Perhaps most importantly, there also seem to be differences in the criteria."</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad to see this kind of thing from Valve. There's certainly a business case for it, inasmuch as options for players with impaired vision need to be justified in terms of the balance sheet. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.3 billion people worldwide "experience a significant disability". Back in 2023, our James wrote a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">custom and adaptive controllers in particular</a>, discussing how corporate profit motives inevitably limit the options, together with the lingering problem of ableist players perceiving accessibility features as 'cheating'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-review.1217577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye may look like an exciting, GTA-adjacent action-adventure in short clips and GIFs, but actually playing it through to the end of its story has revealed an unfinished, overly ambitious project that’s plagued with performance problems, makes precious little use of its open world, and is crippled by unconvincing combat and dull mission design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s natural to draw comparisons with GTA, in basic terms MindsEye is more akin to the Mafia series. That is, it’s a tightly linear, single-player story where the open world largely exists as a backdrop for you to drive from mission to mission. That doesn’t end up serving it very well. Mafia is great. MindsEye is not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Jacob Diaz, a former soldier and drone operator who has been railroaded out of the military after a botched mission, albeit with an extremely rare piece of tech still embedded in his neck. He’s a pretty thinly drawn amnesiac hero overall, with no especially memorable characteristics beyond his ability to follow instructions. After securing a security job at mega-company Silva Corp in the Las Vegas-inspired city of Redrock, Diaz is quickly embroiled in an AI-gone-bad, robots-gone-wild adventure that starts slow, gets a little more intriguing a few hours in, and then ends like someone’s yanked the plug out of the wall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MindsEye does have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Credit where it’s due, MindsEye <em>does </em>have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. It fuses locations like normal homes and strip malls that wouldn’t look out of place in the present day with the proliferation of high-tech robotics and drones. The result is a world that appears appropriately futuristic, but doesn’t feel alien or unrecognisable. From an aesthetic perspective, it really does appear a few years from now in a well-executed way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also includes a genuinely impressive fleet of vehicles – and there’s a practicality to them that makes them look like real cars from, say, five to 10 years in the future. It basically takes modern trends – like today’s massive, chunkily-accented pick-up trucks, teardrop-shaped electric sedans, and battery-powered retromods – and successfully projects a decade of tweaks onto them. More importantly, the handling is actually genuinely good in a way open-world action games rarely manage. The cars you actually get to drive are weighty and really love to be whipped into high-speed handbrake turns through the realistically thick traffic. There’s none of that stickiness that’s typical of GTA clones like Sleeping Dogs (which I love regardless) or Saints Row (which I do not). You know, the kind of superficial handling that feels like you’re turning the world under the car, rather than the car itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is largely where the praise stops.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mind Over Matter</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first mission is a short drive into the desert to shoot four robots who barely have the vigour to fire back, and the second requires you to track a slow-moving thief by monitoring a security console and… switching cameras. It’s not exactly an explosive opening stanza, but things don’t get that much better when the bullets really start flying. It’s around 10 hours of the most boringly straightforward missions from the past decades of open-world action games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the handful of bot types and human soldiers is mostly just plain, and dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts. Humans are the least sensible. Sometimes they take cover; sometimes they just walk towards you waiting to get shot. Run out to meet them and they’re confusingly slow to react (not that this is a particularly strong tactic, as there is no melee attack). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just janky. On the one hand, you can actually shoot individual pieces – including weapons – off the bots. That’s nice. On the other, put a round into a human standing behind some scenery and they’ll often blink back into cover with no linking animation whatsoever. That’s shoddy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not due to a lack of firepower, because MindsEye does feature plenty of guns, although it mostly just chucks them into your arsenal with so little fanfare I usually didn’t notice. I’d just spot something new in my weapon wheel, like another assault rifle, or some kind of energy blaster. It’s rarely clear about what you should be using at any given moment, and it doesn’t seem to matter much. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action does improve towards the back end of the story, as Diaz gets access to all his partner drone’s special perks. The ability to zap an enemy robot and turn it into an instant ally gives the action some zest that it absolutely lacks out of the gate. Your drone’s grenade ability is also neat for a while, but it’s probably a bit <em>too </em>effective at clearing out enemies ahead. I spent most of the late game missions as my drone, dropping endless grenades on soldiers and robots from high above. It made what turned out to be the penultimate battle into one of the easiest because the bad guys just have no defense against this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The primary problem I had with MindsEye, though, was its drastically uneven performance on my high-end PC (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). While the auto settings placed the bulk of the configurable options at ‘High’ – and capped the frame rate at 60fps – my playthrough was rife with issues. It’s regularly blurry and choppy when panning, and the frame rate would flutter and sometimes hang. During one car chase performance chugged to a crawl and was only barely playable. Sometimes even the cutscenes would stutter and display ghosting. Experimenting with lowering the settings hasn’t yielded much in the way of positive results. It’s in really rough shape technically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, there <em>are </em>definitely moments in MindsEye when it looks quite stunning. Explosions are excellent. The sunlight piercing through Redrock’s glitzy hotels is seriously snazzy. I liked the sheer scale and complexity of the Silva factory’s rocket loader, and at one point the metallic sheen of a parked jet in the desert glare stopped me in my tracks. When it runs well and looks good, it looks very good. But six months ago I played through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on this machine and it performed fabulously. MindsEye does not. It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance optimisation won’t solve MindsEye’s myriad other issues, though. A lot of these are really just baked into how it’s designed. Too often, the missions are simply restrictive and <em>dull</em>. All you can do is drive a pre-assigned vehicle to a marker. That triggers a cutscene. Then you shoot everything. Then drive somewhere else. It’s all so rigid and leaves no room for the kind of goofing around or antics you can get into in comparable games, and there’s certainly none of the emergent fun you constantly get in something like GTA. MindsEye rarely trusts us to even park at a mission marker; it generally just splutters into a cutscene when you get close enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t help that there are no radio stations or songs to listen to as you’re commuting between missions. Travel time from A to B mostly seems to exist to feed you phone calls to prod the story along a little further. Exploration is actively disencouraged, and you’ll be constantly scolded for not heading directly to your destination, or failed out. There’s no reason to explore anyhow, as it isn’t the sort of living world you might have expected. Police don’t even respond to Diaz’s crimes, so what’s even the point?</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s not really anything out there to find. Hunting for a cool vehicle to use? Don’t bother. Other vehicles are off-limits. Wreck the car you were assigned? That’s a mission fail. You won’t even be able to get out of it if it's burning. It’s a baffling choice for a game like this – the entire genre is built around stealing cars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye has <em>some </em>good ideas. An effective stealth mission mid-way is a positive change of pace, and there are some unexpected puzzles late in the piece that gave me a break from blasting. But it relegates the rest of them to its roughly two hours of cutscenes and wastes their potential. At one point a squad of robots are set sprinting after my car at highway speeds. While I was preparing myself for a potentially thrilling chase, the robots caught the car and destroyed it before the cinematic finished. This kind of thing is a real rug pull in a game that, a few hours earlier, made me play through a frustrating, one-off CPR minigame that could’ve just been a cutscene.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/vlcsnap-2025-06-13-16h59m26s447-1749799399148.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive...</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even apparent bosses die in cutscenes. And in an unforgivable transgression, if there’s a way to skip them (even when replaying missions and watching them a second time), I couldn’t find it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bots on Your Mind</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The kicker is, even if you get swept up in the sunk-cost fallacy of finishing this 10-hour campaign just to see how the story pans out, the ending itself is a colossal anticlimax. I’ll obviously refrain from spilling the specifics of the final moment, but it’s impossible to complete any assessment of MindsEye’s defects without explaining how deeply and desperately unsatisfying I found it. Story threads are left dangling and reams of questions remain unanswered. It’s not an artistic cliffhanger; it’s just vague and unearned. It’s an ending that feels like the writer was out of fresh paper and this was the only thing that would fit on the last line of the script’s final page. Picture Ghostbusters crashing to credits a few seconds after they cross the streams and you’re about there. There’s a PS after the unskippable credits, but it only makes things worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, until what happens <em>after </em>the finale, that is. After the story wrapped I was simply tossed back into the open world as… some random weirdo in a crop top. He has some kind of… base? With things in it I can interact with that do… nothing?

I got in the only one that would allow me to enter and drove to an icon that looked like the Hamburglar stealing a car. There was another car there, glowing, but I couldn’t enter it. I shot at the bystanders, and I shot at the soldiers. The soldiers popped out of their 4X4s like waffles from an overzealous toaster. Nothing else happened. No armed response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got back in the small hatchback I arrived in, which remained the only vehicle I could interact with. I drove to an icon that looked like a chess piece. The performance took another significant nosedive as I arrived. There were some soldiers there, spread throughout a multi-story parking lot. I shot at them until I got bored, which happened almost instantly because the action is restricted to basic third-person blasting. Chubby crop top man has none of the entertaining drone attacks that Diaz has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it appears, is MindsEye’s free-roaming mode. It’s separate from the main campaign, but I have no idea what we’re intended to <em>do </em>in it. It’s pointless, scrappy, and a complete waste of time in this state. It just isn’t <em>remotely </em>close to finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I am. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, the leveling system for the characters in Nightreign is streamlined compared to the more-freeform point-system of Elden Ring. So what do they all mean, and what numbers are worth chasing over others?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zullie the Witch</a> recently dove into the behind-the-scenes numbers to figure that out. While Nightreign simplifies progression down to level-ups, these pre-assigned values can be looked at and charted, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztsyTDzF9Zg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zullie has done in their video</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One fascinating detail they found was that the jump from level 1 to level 2 adds "far more" than any other level up, making that first Site of Grace a big one. On the other hand, levels 13 through 15 apparently add fewer attributes for most characters, imposing a "softcap" around level 12. You'll get more stats, but they won't be as drastic as those early levels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They also note statistics seem to have different scales between the different properties. Duchess, for example, has a B in Dexterity and A in Intelligence, but her point values across the levels end up fairly even. Also, strangely, no one gains points in Arcane across their levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're curious, the highest total level character if one were to build them in Elden Ring would be Recluse. Per Zullie, this is due to the Recluse having the same stat growth for both Intelligence and Faith; her points cap out at 51 on both values, at level 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some actionable advice here for build-crafting. Zullie found that each point of Vigor always adds exactly 20 HP at any level. Additionally, it looks like Relics that raise attack statistics will seem stronger at lower levels, but get outpaced by "other damage bonuses" as the game goes on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's some fascinating datamining that's sure to help with build-crafting, as you put together your Relics and aim for different rewards in the field. If anything, just remember: that first level-up is big, so don't delay it. And if you're curious about other details, it's worth looking into Zullie's videos about what lies <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ever-wondered-whats-behind-the-mask-of-elden-ring-nightreigns-characters-heres-your-answer">behind the mask of the Nightfarers</a> and other videos, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find on their YouTube channel here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
