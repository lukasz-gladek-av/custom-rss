            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!
</p>

<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

<p>
The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.

The French RPG is clearly inspired by the Japanese greats like <em>Final Fantasy </em>and <em>Persona</em>, but its <em>Paper Mario</em>-style timing elements and wealth of original mechanics keep its grind engaging and decidedly modern. My time with the game hasn’t been without frustrations, but I’m writing these impressions wishing I could be playing the game instead.

But although the team has put out several games in just under a decade, none of them have quite felt like a collaborative effort bearing the distinct creative fingerprints of both creators, until now. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </em>may not be a death game like the duo’s previous work, but the tactical RPG is still overflowing with both Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s signature twists, turns, over-the-top characters, and bold design elements that have made each of their works memorable. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b3f1cce72ae0e0dbe94a6a386a5e58c3" data-recommend-id="image://b3f1cce72ae0e0dbe94a6a386a5e58c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3f1cce72ae0e0dbe94a6a386a5e58c3" data-recommend-id="image://b3f1cce72ae0e0dbe94a6a386a5e58c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956"><em>Marathon</em></a></span> is out in less than six months and there’s still a lot we don’t know about it.

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty</a> fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a "replica explosive device" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media.</p>

<p>"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag," the TSA quipped in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542">Facebook post</a>, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p>
<p>The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it.</p>
<p>"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?" asked one.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only</a>. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating.</p>
<p>While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcwngWPXQtg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Jon M. Chu, best known for his recent work on the film adaptation of <em>Wicked</em>, would direct the movie. While Chu has never adapted a video game before, he has built his career transferring stories from other media onto the big screen, including books, cartoons, and recently, Broadway musicals. At the very least, he's been successful in directing at least one movie starring two women with magical abilities, so one can see the logic in bringing the assignment to him.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The project will also star Sydney Sweeney (</span></span><span><span>Euphoria, White Lotus, Madame Web</span></span><span><span>), though it's yet to be decided which of the leads, Mio or Zoe, she will play. Sweeney is also set to executive produce the film. Oddly, this is the second piece of Sweeney-related game adaptation news we got this week, since </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie"><span><span><span><span>she'll also be producing a Michael Bay-directed adaptation of Outrun, a Sega racing series</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Story Kitchen is set to produce the film and bring the project to movie studios, as none have picked it up yet. The production company happens to have tons of other game adaptations in the works as well, including films based on Just Cause, Ruiner, Shinobi, and a live-action Tomb Raider series.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-until-dawn-movies-greatest-weakness-is-straying-so-far-away-from-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for the </strong></em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u><em><strong>Until Dawn</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> movie.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been racking my brain over the conundrum that is adapting Until Dawn. Supermassive Games' deconstruction of horror cinema through choice-based butterfly effect mechanics is essentially a 10-hour playable movie—a damn fine one written by indie horror staples Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick—so a film adaptation couldn't just be the same thing. But a film that isn’t indebted to the game and its "choose your own adventure" method doesn't feel appropriate either. Sony's desire to release an Until Dawn adaptation seemed misguided upon announcement, and after viewing the film, it's still a headscratcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's because David F. Sandberg's Until Dawn movie betrays the core hook of Supermassive's Until Dawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writers Gary Dauberman and Blair Butler chose to adapt Until Dawn as its title reads. In this case, "Until Dawn" translates into a time-loop-like horror scenario where five young adults find themselves hunted by various baddies, and they only escape if they can survive … until dawn. Should anyone die, they'll wake once a gigantic hourglass fixed to an ominous, skull-adorned mount drops its last grain of sand. Die enough times, and you become a wendigo lost to Dr. Alan J. Hill's delirious experiment. The core impetus of a missing sibling is still there—Ella Rubin's protagonist, Clover, is hunting for her missing sister—but otherwise, you're not on Blackwood Mountain aka Mount Washington (er…yet), and certainly not similarly punished for choices that alter narrative paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's… not Until Dawn. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn Gallery</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Death Shouldn't Be An Afterthought</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, death matters. It matters so much, in fact, that killing a single character sends ripple effects felt throughout the remaining storylines. There's no regeneration or second chances. Like, famously. That's the point of Until Dawn. The stakes are so astronomically high, the slightest nervous twitch of your controller during a "stay still" Quicktime event could doom multiple characters. Dauberman and Butler fail to translate the nerve-wracking experience of playing Until Dawn, landing on quite the opposite concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, Until Dawn is a beginner's attempt at Cabin in the Woods. Glore Valley is drenched by a thunderstorm, except for a perfect circle of sunshine over the welcome center location, like some all-powerful horror movie god is controlling the rain—once again resembling Cabin in the Woods in terms of the “influencing environment” effect. The all-seeing overlord (Dr. Hill), the meta nature of characters joking about horror movie rules, and the different creatures unleashed each rewind? Despite countless plot configurations, the game's powerful storytelling is far superior to this random assortment of scary scenes tied to an hourglass clock. The game pulls players deeper into a web of intrigue, where the movie's Mad Libs nature drags viewers through a jumbled rotation of clowns-and-kooks randomness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Points are awarded for at least using wendigos. In the game, Fessenden's "Stranger" character reveals that a 1952 mining cave-in led to cannibalism, and said cannibals turned into wendigos that now haunt Blackwood. Here, Clover and her friends start turning into wendigos due to Dr. Hill's experiments on Glore Valley from his sanatorium hideout (resembling his dingy in-game office). It's not a one-for-one translation, nor does it need to be, but the wendigos are overshadowed by a slasher villain vaguely costumed after Josh's psycho getup. There are also witches, porcelain doll-looking masks, creepypasta demons, and water that makes your entire body explode Scanners-style if you drink it. It's a hodgepodge of dangers that have nothing to do with Fessenden and Reznick's straightforward creature-centric game, outside of a few Easter eggs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious connection is Peter Stormare as Dr. Hill, Josh Washington’s (Rami Malek) hallucinated psychiatrist who runs players through rigorous psychological tests that influence future in-game details. However, even Dr. Hill features stark differences in the film vs. the original game. In the movie, he's seen as a gas station attendant, but it's not long before he's outed as former game character Dr. Hill—who's in control of experiments on Glore Valley. It’s here where we have the only direct reference to the game’s most well-known character, Josh Washington. After Clover discovers Hill’s “office,” we see her patient profile alongside Josh’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some exposition about Hill's experiments as we watch prisoners cannibalize bodies and then turn into wendigos to highlight that connection to the game, but the reveal is followed by Clover defeating Dr. Hill pretty easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except she doesn’t. Probably. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the film ends, we return to the dirty sanitarium office where Dr. Hill explodes after ingesting some 'splodey water, and on surveillance monitors, we see Blackwood's lodge. We then hear Dr. Hill speak, suggesting he was Clover's hallucination, much like Josh's in the game. But, that's right before the credits because I guess Sandberg's movie is an offshoot prequel that, for some reason, has nothing to do with the actual events of the Until Dawn game? If there is a sequel, presumably it'll be about Josh's case of vengeance paid unto the Blackwood group except based on the film's rules … somehow.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cheap Easter Eggs Aren't Enough</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just all so generic. Turning Dr. Hill into the baddie removes intrigue and becomes a cheap cop-out, torn from the game but improperly refitted. Then the stinger of Blackwood hits, which again is confusing <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3865395/practical-effects-easter-eggs-deleted-scenes-more-with-until-dawn-director-david-sandberg-maxime-alexandre-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>because in interviews</u></a>, Sandberg insists his film takes place after the game's timeline—but Blackwood's reveal suggests it's not a sequel, but a prequel. Inconsequentiality plagues Sandberg's film in a way that makes you wonder why it's even tied to Until Dawn (*cough* intellectual property reasons *cough*), which only causes Blackwood's tease to be even more spoonfed and underwhelming. For so long, Until Dawn (the movie) bears no resemblance to Until Dawn (the game)—why pivot back toward the game at the last minute?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn: Movie Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason is simple: to appease us fans. There are choice moments that attempt to help us relive the game, but they're crammed in like afterthoughts. Ji-young Yoo's spiritualist character Megan has everyone hold hands in silence, mimicking the game's quiet "hold your breath" Quicktime events. There's a shot bathed in red lighting where a wendigo is right by a frightened Clover, and that's a direct reference to the "Don't Move" instructions. But the game's cinematic nature doesn't yield many other level-based opportunities to recreate, nor does the film try. The adaptation’s biggest issue is it never fully comprehends how best to honor Supermassive's inspiration while telling a fresh horror tale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What else might you recognize? The wendigo audio files are plucked from the game, reusing the same noises. There's also Abe's first death of being chopped in half, which could be respect paid to Josh's fake death in the game, or maybe that's just a lucky coincidence. Are the werewolf sketches in the witch's cabin a possible reference to The Quarry? Is the radio in the basement the same radio in the game where characters find out they must survive until dawn? Chances are yes, but these Easter eggs feel forced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I'm all for a "spiritual successor." But to do so, there has to be some resemblance to the thing you are named after. While I don't think Until Dawn is a terrible movie, it's a bad Until Dawn movie. It's a far cry from the urgency and invasive dread that Supermassive so easily conjures, speaking to what makes the playable horror movie such a blast to complete (over and over). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is, the Until Dawn movie doesn't make much sense in context. The events of Glore Valley are a grab bag of ideas from other horror movies that would be nothing but a clip show without Dr. Hill's inclusion. But even with Stormare's reprised role, it's only Until Dawn at face value, nothing deeper. I get the interpretation of the gang's choices forcing them to keep restarting, but it's still too far off-base to consider this adaptation anything more than unfaithful. In the end, Until Dawn is a missed opportunity to bring Supermassive's smash-hit game to life.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This week, overall, is a great week for Chaos (check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">our review of the other new Chaos Battleforce, the Gorestorm Slaughterpack</a>), so follow along as we hold our noses and get into the funk with the Poxwrought Vector Battleforce box, up for preorder now!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce Contents:</h2>

<p>The Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;contains the following miniatures:</p>

<ul><li>1x Lord of Poxes</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Foetid Bloat-drone</li>
	<li>1x Myphitic Blight-hauler</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Plagueburst Crawler</li>
	<li>5x Blightlord Terminators</li>
	<li>7x&nbsp;Plague Marines</li>
</ul><h3>Reappearing Ability: Nurgle's Gift [Aura]</h3>

<p>Many of the units in this box come with the Nurgle's Gift [Aura] special ability, so I think it's worth explaining that here before we dive into individual unit profiles! With a contagion range emanating out from each unit unit (range grows in the first three rounds), and while an enemy unit is within that range, that unit is Afflicted with one of three abilities you choose at the Declare Battle Formations step:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>Each enemy unit that is Afflicted has 1 toughness subtracted.</li>
	<li><b>Option 1 - Skullsquirm Blight:&nbsp;</b>Each time a model in this (afflicted) unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 2 - Rattlejoint Ague:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 3 - Scabrous Soulrot:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Move, Leadership, and Objective Control characteristics of models in this unit by 1 (this rule can only worsen a model's OC characteristic to a minimum of 1).</li>
</ul><p>Now that we understand how Nurgle's Gift works, let's dive into the individual units!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- NEW UNIT:&nbsp;<b>Lord of Poxes</b></h2>

	<li><strong>Gift of Poxes:&nbsp;</strong>Add 3" to the range of this model's Contagion Range.</li>
	<li><strong>Shroud of Disease:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit cannot be targeted by ranged attacks unless the attacking model is within 18".</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Lord of Poxes:</h3>

<p>This unit can lead as an attachment to a unit of Plague Marines, and that's the best way to get him in there. Though not incredible on his own, by attaching him you're shielding your Marines from long-range weaponry with his Shroud of Disease ability. And extending out the Contagion Range turns an ordinary unit of Plague Marines into a walking, festering cloud of de-buffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plague Marines Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 2 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 2</p>

<p><strong>Plague Marines Ranged Weapon Options:</strong></p>

</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plague Marines:</h3>

<p>When paired with the Lord of Poxes, these Plague Marines should really be run as a tough, shoot-y unit that's out there sitting on an objective and spraying around the Afflicted condition on enemies that try to get close-in.</p>

</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Blightlord Terminators:</h3>

<p>There's nothing quite like slowly stomping toward your opponents (or unloading from a transport vehicle!) with a unit of Terminators, hunkering down with your 2+ save, and blasting them to bits. Add in the benefit you get from targeting Afflicted units, and it's about to get stanky in here!</p>

<p>There's a nice mobility here you don't find in on-foot units from this slow-as-sludge army, but unless you're expecting a lot of tanks in the meta you're up against, this might spend most of its time lobbing missiles and bile from a distance, hoping to score a few odd hits.</p>

<p>This is one of those units where the flavor of the weaponry at hand really shines through&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;helps guide you toward a play style. You want to send out shock-waves of spores into the thick of battle, so position your Plagueburst Crawler in just the right spot, launch that 48" ranged Mortar at your enemies, and laugh in that hacking cough way you do as the spores rain down destruction.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Foetid Bloat-Drone</h2>

<h3><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Hovering Death:&nbsp;</strong>This unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Foetid Bloat-Drone:</h3>

<p>How you want to build this unit is up to you, as I think there's an argument to be made either to have two auto-hitting plaguespitters equipped, or the 10 (!!) hits on the Fleshmower. Either way, this unit is meant to get into the action, belt out wounds, and next turn fall back thanks to its Hovering Death ability.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;is what a Battleforce should look like, in my opinion. With six different types of units included, this vehicle-heavy box set is a really fun way to get a new army onto the tabletop in a way that feels very different from other boxes. I think, generally speaking, the design of the Death Guard is some of the best in Warhammer 40K, and this box shows how that Nurgle rot manifests across so many different types of units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656284/bionic-bay-review-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Wandering through <em>Bionic Bay</em>’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a> and <em>Limbo</em>, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer like <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well.</p><p>What first drew me to <em>Bionic Bay</em> was that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot.</p><p>In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements of <em>Bionic Bay</em> is its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game.</p><p>Key to this is that <em>Bionic Bay</em> encourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying.</p><p>The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions. And while I wish the game focused a little more on exploration, the weird and unforgiving world is also what helped me persevere through the trickier challenges. I just had to see what was next.</p><p>If you’re a fan of sci-fi works like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune</em></a>, with their impressive sense of scale, <em>Bionic Bay</em> offers something very similar. You just have to work hard to see it all.</p><p><sub>Bionic Bay <em>is out now on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>For many gamers, this week's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">release of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> has provided a good excuse to revisit a well-remembered RPG classic from years past. For others, it's provided a good excuse to catch up on a well-regarded game that they haven't gotten around to playing in the nearly two decades since its release.</p>
<p>I'm in that second group. While I've played a fair amount of <em>Skyrim</em> (on platforms ranging from the Xbox 360 to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/the-world-of-skyrim-is-thrilling-and-flawed-in-vr/">VR headsets</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-impressions-putting-the-vast-back-in-vast-cosmos/"><em>Starfield</em></a>, I've never taken the time to go back to the earlier Bethesda Game Studios RPGs. As such, my impressions of <em>Oblivion</em> before this <em>Remaster</em> have been guided by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/03/oblivion/">old critical reactions</a> and the <a href="https://trismegistus.tech/apps/the-cheddar-scrolls/en.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-beloved-oblivion-meme-got-remade-7-years-later-proving-oblivion-remastered-preserves-the-timeless-comedy-of-the-original">memes</a> calling attention to the game's somewhat janky engine.</p>
<p>Playing through the first few hours of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>&nbsp;this week, without the benefit of nostalgia, I can definitely see why <em>Oblivion</em> made such an impact on RPG fans in 2006. But I also see all the ways that the game can feel a bit dated after nearly two decades of advancements in genre design.</p>
<h2>One chance at a first impression</h2>
<p>From the jump, I found myself struggling to suspend my disbelief enough to buy into the narrative conventions <em>Oblivion</em> throws at the beginner player. The fact that the doomed king and his armed guards need to escape through a secret passage that just so happens to cut through my jail cell seems a <em>little</em> too convenient for my brain to accept without warning sirens going off. I know it's just a contrivance to get my personal hero's journey story going, but it's a clunky way to dive into the world.</p>

<p>The same goes for the way the king dies just a few minutes into the tutorial, and his willingness to trust me with the coveted Amulet of Kings because the "Dragonblood" let him "see something" in me. Even allowing for some amount of necessary <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Chosen One trope-iness</a> in this kind of fantasy story, the sheer speed with which my character went from "condemned prisoner" to "the last hope of the dying king" made my head spin a bit. Following that pivotal scene with a dull "go kill some goblins and rats in the sewer" escape sequence also felt a little anticlimactic given the epic responsibility with which I was just entrusted.</p>

<p>To be sure, Patrick Stewart's regal delivery in the early game helps paper over a lot of potential weaknesses with the initial narrative. And even beyond Stewart's excellent performance, I appreciated how the writing is concise and to the point, without the kind of drawn-out, pause-laden delivery that characterizes many games of the time.</p>
<h2>The wide world of <em>Oblivion</em></h2>
<p>Once I escaped out into the broader world of <em>Oblivion</em> for the first time, I was a bit shocked to open my map and see that I could fast travel to a wide range of critical locations immediately, without any need to discover them for myself first. I felt a bit like a guilty cheater warping myself to the location of my next quest waypoint rather than hoofing through the massive forest that I'm sure hundreds of artists spent countless months meticulously constructing (and, more recently, remastering).</p>

<p>I felt less guilty after accidentally stealing a horse, though. After a key quest giver urged me to go take a horse from a nearby stable, I was a bit shocked when I mounted the first horse I saw and heard two heavily armed guards nearby calling me a thief and leaping into pursuit (I guess I should have noticed the red icon before making my mount). No matter, I thought; they're on foot and I'm now on a horse, so I can get away with my inadvertent theft quite easily.</p>
<p>Determined not to just fast-travel through the entire game, I found that galloping across a rain-drenched forest through the in-game night was almost too atmospheric. I ended up turning up the recommended brightness settings a few notches just so I could see the meticulously rendered trees and rocks around me.</p>
<p>After dismounting to rid a cave of some pesky vampires, I returned to the forest to find my stolen horse was nowhere to be found. At this point, I had trouble deciding if this was simply a realistic take on an unsecured, unmonitored horse wandering off or if I was the victim of a janky engine that couldn't keep track of my mount.</p>

<p>The jank was a bit clearer when I randomly stumbled across my first Oblivion gate while wandering through the woods. As I activated the gate to find a world engulfed in brilliant fire, I was surprised to find an armed guard had also appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and apparently still mad about my long-lost stolen horse!</p>
<p>When I deactivated the gate in another attempt to escape justice, I found myself immediately stuck chest deep in the game's scenery, utterly unable to move as that hapless guard tried his best to subdue me. I ended up having to restore an earlier save, losing a few minutes of progress to a game engine that still has its fair share of problems.</p>
<h2>What’s beneath the surface?</h2>
<p>So far, I'm of two minds about <em>Oblivion</em>'s overall world-building. When it comes to the civilized parts of the world, I'm relatively impressed. The towns seem relatively full during the daytime—both in terms of people and in terms of interesting buildings to explore or patronize. I especially enjoy the way every passerby seems to have a unique voice and greeting ready for me, even before I engage them directly. I even think it's kind of cute when these NPCs end a pleasant conversation with a terse "leave me alone!" or "stop talking to me!"</p>

<p>Even the NPCs that seem least relevant to the story seem to have their own deep backstory and motivations; I was especially tickled by an alchemist visiting from afar who asked if I knew the local fine for necrophilia. (It can't hurt to ask, right?) And discussing random rumors with everyone I meet has gone a long way toward establishing the social and political backstory of the world while also providing me with some engaging and far-flung side quests. There's a lot of depth apparent in these interactions, even if I haven't had the chance to come close to fully exploring it yet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the vast spaces in between the cities and towns seem like so much wasted space, at this point. I've quickly learned not to waste much time exploring caves or abandoned mines, which so far seem to house a few middling enemies guarding some relatively useless trinkets in treasure chests. The same goes for going out of my way to activate the various wayshrines and Ayelid Wells that dot the landscape, which have hardly seemed worth the trip (thus far, at least).</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that I've found <em>Oblivion</em>'s early combat almost wholly unengaging so far. Even at a low level, my warrior-mage has been able to make easy work of every random enemy I've faced with a combination of long-range flare spells and close-range sword swings. It definitely doesn't help that I have yet to fight more than two enemies at once, or find a foe that seems to have two strategic brain cells to rub together. Compared to the engaging, tactical group combat of modern action RPGs like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/"><em>Avowed</em></a>, the battles here feel downright archaic.</p>

<p>I found this was true even as I worked my way through closing my first Oblivion gate, which had recently left the citizens of Kvask as sympathetic refugees huddling on the outskirts of town. Here, I thought, would be some battles that required crafty tactics, powerful items, or at least some level grinding to become more powerful. Instead, amid blood-soaked corridors that wouldn't feel out of place in a <em>Doom</em> game, I found the most challenging speedbumps were mages that sponged up a moderate amount of damage while blindly charging right at me.</p>
<p>While I'm still decidedly in the early part of a game that can easily consume over 100 hours for a completionist, so far I'm having trouble getting past the most dated bits of <em>Oblivion</em>'s design. Character design and vocal production that probably felt revolutionary two decades ago now feel practically standard for the genre, while technical problems and dull combat seem best left in the past. Despite a new coat of paint, this was one <em>Remaster</em> I found difficult to fully connect with so long after its initial release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-new-oblivion-looks-like-a-remake-but-plays-like-a-remaster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda finally revealed Oblivion Remastered earlier this week, I could hardly believe my eyes. Somehow 2006’s trip to Tamriel, known for its weird, potato-faced characters and smeary stretches of low-res verdant grasslands, is now the best-looking Elder Scrolls game ever made. A long history of HD overhauls has conditioned me to expect underwhelming results from remasters – Mass Effect Legendary Edition and Dark Souls Remastered are barely indistinguishable from their Xbox 360 parents, for instance – and so to see the Imperial City that I explored nearly 20 years ago rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with ray tracing was momentarily unbelievable. Not only that, but the game has been enhanced with upgrades to combat, RPG systems, and a multitude of other details. All that considered, I wondered if Bethesda and the project’s developer, Virtuos, had got the title wrong. Surely this is Oblivion <em>Remake</em>, not remastered? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out I wasn’t alone in that thinking. Numerous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">fans have declared it a remake</a>, and even Bruce Nesmith, the senior game designer on the original Oblivion project, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-designer-says-bethesdas-remaster-is-so-impressive-it-could-be-called-oblivion-20">“I’m not sure [the word] remaster actually does it justice.”</a> But while I doubted Bethesda and Virtuos’ remaster claim at first, after playing several hours it’s actually pretty clear – Oblivion Remastered may look like a remake but it plays like a remaster.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of reasons why Oblivion looks like a remake and they can be easily summed up: Virtuos has done a huge amount of work, with "every single asset redesigned from scratch." In terms of what you physically see on screen, it is all brand new. Every tree, every sword, every crumbling castle. This means Oblivion lives up to modern graphical expectations. Not only is it beautifully textured, it also has gorgeous lighting and a whole new physics system that ensures every arrow and weapon strike affects the world realistically. And while all who you meet in the game are recognisably the same folks you crossed paths with back in 2006, every single NPC model is a brand new creation. It’s a hugely impressive overhaul that rejects the idea of making something that “looks like you remember” and instead aims for something that’s great by 2025 standards. It’s the best a Bethesda Game Studios RPG has ever looked, and if I had seen it before the remaster rumours began I’d probably have believed that it was The Elder Scrolls 6.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just visuals, though. Combat has been overhauled, and so swinging a longsword no longer feels like fencing with a balloon. The third person camera is now actually functional thanks to the addition of a reticule. Every menu, from the quest journal to dialogue to the lockpicking and persuasion minigames, have all had refreshed interfaces. The original, horrific levelling system has been replaced with a much more logical hybrid of Oblivion and Skyrim’s approaches. And <em>finally </em>you can sprint. With so many visual and gameplay upgrades, surely we are firmly in remake territory? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I had seen Oblivion Remastered before the rumours began I’d probably have believed that it was The Elder Scrolls 6.   </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big issue here is not so much one of technology, game changes, or project scope, but semantics. There are no industry-defined parameters for remakes and remasters, and publishers recklessly throw the terms around. Rockstar’s “Definitive Edition” remasters of the Grand Theft Auto trilogy are unmistakably blocky PlayStation 2-era games with upscaled textures and modern lighting effects. But the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, also branded a remaster, sports all-new graphical assets and looks like a game from the modern era. Things are even muddier when we get to remakes: Bluepoint’s Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls both rebuild their respective games from the ground up, but are faithful, 1:1 recreations of the original experiences. Resident Evil 2, meanwhile, sticks more-or-less to the original blueprint in terms of structure, but completely redesigns the way you interact with the survival horror icon. And then we have Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth, which radically overhaul the design, script, and even story beats of the original games. All five of these examples are considered remakes, but there’s very little shared philosophy between them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point in time, the general consensus seemed to be that if the game had been rebuilt from scratch in a modern engine, it was considered a remake. Remasters, meanwhile, were more limited upgrades performed within the scope of the game’s original technology. Such a definition is clearly becoming fast outdated, though. Today, it seems more fitting to say that a remaster is a graphical overhaul that preserves the design of the original game (bar a few quality of life gameplay upgrades), while a remake redesigns a game from scratch. Such a definition would “downgrade” Demon’s Souls and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid: Delta to remasters, and ensure the remake term only applies to games that genuinely feel like new takes on old ideas. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/25/oblivion-remastered-1745587732759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New lighting, fur, and metallic effects are just the tip of the iceburg of Oblivion Remastered's changes. Image credit: Bethesda / Virtuos</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So if we accept these proposed definitions, is this new version of Oblivion a remake or a remaster? As anyone who’s played even just an hour of it can plainly see, Oblivion Remastered absolutely has the correct name. Yes, those new assets and Unreal Engine 5 ray tracing effects make it look brand new, but beneath that glowing skin is a collection of 20-year-old bones, organs, and muscles, all roughly stapled and taped together in that unmistakably Bethesda way. As the studio explained, “We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it. But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hallmarks of that previous era are everywhere. It's in the loading screens that hide behind almost every single door. It’s in the baffling persuasion minigame that still, despite the interface upgrade, barely makes sense and feels utterly disconnected to your conversations. It’s in the design of the cities, which have the simplistic design of theatre stage sets rather than the complex, knotty arrangements of authentic population centres. It’s in the NPCs, who wander like awkward automatons and talk with all the grace of an AI trained on a “how to be society” manual. It’s in the combat, which even after a significant upgrade still feels detached and unwieldy. And it's in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">long list of bugs and glitches</a> that still remain, reverently preserved in the name of upkeeping the original’s quirky charm. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The granular details of Oblivion are clearly grey and long in the tooth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a couple of months ago we were treated to Obsidian’s Avowed, which offered a vision of the future for some of The Elder Scrolls’ key building blocks. Its kinetic combat is practically space-age compared to Oblivion Remastered’s, while its approach to rewarding exploration makes the rolling hills and grotty caves of Cyrodiil feel very much a relic of yesteryear. Such modern systems help put Oblivion Remastered into context. That’s not to say that this revised classic has nothing to offer in 2025 – far from it. The magic of its world still sparkles brightly, its Rohan-like open fields filled with dozens of mysteries and oddities. Much of its ambition remains intact even two generations later, such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-unpredictable-goblin-wars-of-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-i-introduced-controlled-chaos-whenever-i-could" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic goblin wars</a> that wage between its NPC clans, or the narratively-satisfying questing structure that remains head-and-shoulders above Skyrim’s many “visit a draugr-filled dungeon” missions. Many of its old-school ideas around player freedom feel refreshing in an age where we now reject the hand-holding nature of games from the 2010s. But the granular details of Oblivion are clearly grey and long in the tooth. There’s no finesse in its dialogue, nor elegance in the way its systems interconnect. And the level design, be it cave, castle, or the cursed lands of Oblivion itself, feels positively ancient. A remake’s job would be to update all those ideas, but this project is all about reliving the old. As such: Oblivion <em>Remastered</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games have historically leant on terminology from other mediums. In the world of movies, remakes are brand new productions with fresh casts, crews, scripts, and sets. Remasters are existing films that are enhanced as far as possible to match modern picture quality standards. But an old film is still an old film; the 4K restorations of Jaws and The Godfather look incredible, but they are clearly products of the 1970s. You can see it in the direction, the delivery, the effects work. It’s in the texture of the film grain. Oblivion is like those blu-ray restorations of classic films. It pushes visual quality as far as it possibly can, which thanks to the more malleable medium of video games means recreating the project’s “exterior” in a brand new engine. But beneath that shell, Oblivion is unmistakably a product of the 2000s. Alex Murphy, executive producer at Virtuos, had the perfect analogy during the reveal stream: "We think of the Oblivion game engine as the brain and Unreal 5 as the body. The brain drives all the world logic and gameplay and the body brings to life the experience that players have loved for almost 20 years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered is exactly what it says it is, and that shouldn’t be seen as downplaying its achievements. Instead of insisting that it's a remake, we should actually be using it as the quality bar by which we judge remasters from other titan-scale AAA companies. This is what Mass Effect Legendary Edition should have been, rather than a cleaned-up re-release. This is what Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy should have been rather than an incredibly cynical-feeling cash grab. Because there’s nothing cynical about Oblivion Remastered. It looks like a remake crafted by passionate hands but plays like a remaster preserved by loving fans, and that’s exactly how it should be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1915889058024222801/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has surpassed 4 million players in its first four days since <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its launch on April 22</a>. It's undoubtedly an excellent early result, albeit not an unexpected one. Oblivion was, after all, already a very popular game in its time, selling three million units in less than a year. Of course, this remaster has the advantage of being included with Game Pass, where PC and Xbox users with an active subscription can access it without paying an additional fee.</p>
<p>The marketing strategy might have worked in its favor, too. While Bethesda kept absolute silence <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until April 21</a>, when they told fans to connect the following day to watch the full unveiling, there had been leaks and rumors since early 2025, and a few insiders had already correctly anticipated that it would be shadowdropped at some point in April. By the time the game launched on Tuesday, there was already intense anticipation among Elder Scrolls fans, essentially without any effort from Bethesda.</p>
<p>Elder Scrolls games have always had very long legs, thanks to the official support of Bethesda and the unofficial support of the legion of modders who still work hard on games like Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. Oblivion Remastered likely won't get any more official content (though a few performance patches would definitely be welcome to improve the open world stuttering). Still, despite some limitations, the modding community is already hard at work, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are already hundreds of mods on Nexus</a>.</p>
<p>The game is unique because its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, and its game logic is on the original Gamebryo engine. This makes it a bit more challenging to mod than the original game, as explained <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Nexus website</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The core data for the game is still loaded from the plugin files, as with the original games; however, each game object (record) in the plugins is mapped from Oblivion Engine to Unreal Engine using JSON. This means that the traditional methods of detecting conflicts may not work anymore. </em></li>
<li><em>When adding new content to the game, the JSON data for this content would need to be inserted. </em></li>
<li><em>The JSON structures for many game objects include additional values that did not exist in the original game, and the purpose of them is currently unclear. </em></li>
<li><em>Any text that is added to the game via plugins seems to show up with an "[NL]" prefix, which is currently thought to mean "Not Localised". Investigations are ongoing to work out how to make mods that don't have this prefix. </em></li>
<li><em>The new Unreal Engine versions of the textures, models, particles and animation files appear to still be linked to the original version in some cases. </em></li>
<li><em>The Level of Detail (LOD) for this game appears to use a completely new system, most likely heavily controlled by the Unreal Engine side of the game. </em></li>
<li><em>The game uses several scripting languages across different systems, including an updated version of OBScript, Unreal Engine Code, and Unreal Engine Blueprints.</em></li>
<li><em>Concerning a possible script extender for the game (equivalent to xOBSE), there is a challenge of the Creation Engine script extender devs being unfamiliar with Unreal Engine and Unreal Engine modding being unfamiliar with Creation Engine script extenders.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, these challenges aren't nearly enough to deter modders. Some of them have already paused their ongoing work on Skyrim to tinker with Oblivion Remastered. A lot of reverse engineering will have to be done, but the Bethesda modding community has already achieved the impossible with Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, extending their feature sets well beyond the original games' scope. We'll keep an eye on any noteworthy developments within the scene.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every so often, Central Computers — one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/24/22298616/frys-electronics-going-out-of-business">last remaining</a> dedicated Silicon Valley computer stores — lets subscribers know it’s managed to obtain a small shipment of AMD graphics cards. Today, it informed me that I could now purchase a $600 Radeon RX 9070 XT <a href="https://www.centralcomputer.com/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9070-xt-gaming-16gb-gddr6-graphics-card-pcie-5-0-3x-displayport-2-1-1x-hdmi-2-1-16-pin-power-connectors.html">for $850</a> — a $250 markup.</p><p>It’s not alone. I just checked every major US retailer and street prices on eBay, and I regret to inform you: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a> has returned. Many AMD cards are being marked up $100, $200, $250, even $280. The street price of an Nvidia RTX 5080 is now over $1,500, a full $500 higher than MSRP. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">an RTX 5090</a>, the most powerful consumer GPU? You can’t even get the $2,000 card for $3,000 today.</p><p>Here, I’ve built tables to show you:</p><div><h2>GPU street prices: April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>Average eBay street price (Mar-Apr)</h3></th><th><h3>Best retail price (April 25th)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$957</td><td>$880</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$761</td><td>$835</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5090</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$3,871</td><td>$3,140</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5080</td><td>$999</td><td>$1,533</td><td>$1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti</td><td>$749</td><td>$1,052</td><td>$825</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070</td><td>$549</td><td>$715</td><td>$610</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>“Best retail price” is the actual price I saw a card for on April 25th — roughly the minimum you’d pay.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>You shouldn’t just blame tariffs for these price hikes. In early March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">we found retailers were already scalping</a> their supposedly entry-level MSRP models of the new AMD graphics cards. Nor is this likely to just be high demand, given how few cards are changing hands on eBay: only around 1,100 new Nvidia GPUs, and around 266 new AMD GPUs were listed there over the past 30 days.</p><div><p>But tariffs may have an greater impact soon: on May 2nd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">the de minimis exemption will no longer apply</a>, meaning shipments valued at $800 or less can be taxed, and many more shipments will likely get hit as a result. Stores like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656165/shein-temu-price-increase-trump-tariffs-fast-fashion">Shein and Temu have already raised prices</a> in anticipation.</p></div><p>Here’s a deeper dive on the “MSRP” models of the AMD cards, which were all originally listed at $549 or $599:</p><div><h2>AMD “MSRP” GPU prices, April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Newegg</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Micro Center</h3></th><th><h3>eBay street price (past 30 days)</h3></th><th><h3>Units on eBay (past 30 days)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$799</td><td>$755</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$879</td><td>$849</td><td>$879</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$839</td><td>$829</td><td>$949</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Steel Legend 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$699</td><td>$892</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$659</td><td>N/A</td><td>$913</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$699</td><td>$679</td><td>$765</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$789</td><td>$771</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$639</td><td>$749</td><td>$746</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Challenger 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$549</td><td>$609</td><td>$880</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$669</td><td>$893</td><td>36</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>eBay street prices are an average.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve focused this table on Newegg and Micro Center since they carry more models than any other retailer, though I also spotted “MSRP” 9070 XT cards at $800 and $850 at Amazon today, and an $830 card at Best Buy. Otherwise, these are the new sticker prices, not necessarily attainable prices, as most were out of stock.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay">From December 2020</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">July 2022</a>, I periodically tracked the prices of game consoles and GPUs during the covid-19 pandemic, when they were incredibly expensive to obtain. At one point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards">some GPUs were worth triple their MSRP</a>. I’d love to hear from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss"><em>Verge</em> subscribers</a> in particular: is this a valuable service we should continue in the tariff era?

Knowing he would hit “skip” at the start of every game’s tutorial as well feels like an important window into his character.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit</strong>: That was a wild and fun moment, one that made me want to play <em>TIE Fighter </em>again! (I was pretty confused as to why Cassian hadn’t gotten training on how to fly the damn thing beforehand though, but this wound up being explained later.) </p><p>And what I love about that whole intro sequence is that I think it works as a kind of microcosm of what makes Andor such a compelling and brilliant show. It has “fun” moments that are uniquely <em>Star Wars</em> but they’re supported by storytelling that really foregrounds the political conflict that has always been present in the series. </p><p>Right before that scene with the TIE, Cassian speaks to an Imperial technician who has aided him at great personal risk to herself. She asks him a very reasonable question: “If I die tonight, was it worth it?” He gives her a beautiful answer, one that includes the words, “You’ll never feel right unless you’re doing what you can to stop them. You’re coming home to yourself.” It’s so true, I think. So many of us are struggling right now with the potential risk involved in standing up to the malevolent political forces in our own world, but at the same time, not doing something means losing ourselves because we’re not being true to our own moral core. </p><p><em>Andor </em>knows that acting in solidarity is beautiful and that sometimes people have to make some terrible sacrifices. And it confronts us with all of this a few minutes before giving us the almost comical action of Cassian trying to come to grips with the damn ship and mowing down heaps of stormtroopers in the process! </p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> It was a really strong start to the show that instantly reminded viewers of what <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453"><em>Andor</em></a></span><em> </em>is really about, showed us how much he has grown in a year, and also allowed the series to include a fun <em>Star Wars </em>adventure of stealing a TIE Fighter and barely escaping. Perfect opening to a new season. Other writers and showrunners should take notes. </p><p><strong>EG</strong>: That moment with the technician is one of the stronger scenes in the entire opening chapter (first three episodes) and an important element of humanity that sort of underlies the whole project and grounds it, which is that even the big bad galactic empire is full of people just waiting to be tipped over the edge into rebelling. </p><p>For every collaborator there’s someone ready to desert. The opening episodes really do a great job of teetering back and forth between hope and despair, not just because of the insurmountable odds but also because of the grim, dark, and even immoral sacrifices made to try and even them.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>That’s right. It doesn’t try to reduce or simplify things morally or in human terms, something <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-horror-andor-season-2-1851775862?_gl=1*4mmf6k*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4wLjE3NDU2MTgzMDQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-horror-andor-season-2-1851775862?_gl=1*4mmf6k*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4wLjE3NDU2MTgzMDQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Star Wars</em>,</a></span> a series that’s broadly about good vs. evil, “light” and “dark,” has arguably done at times in the past. </p><p>In fact <em>Andor </em>is all about acknowledging the complexities, the reality that solidarity doesn’t always mean working alongside people you’re in total ideological lockstep and perfect harmony with; sometimes it means working with people you have fierce disagreements with about some things, but you’re aligned on one key principle or goal and you let that be enough.</p><p>There sure are some awful people in the Empire, though; I continue to particularly loathe that smarmy bureaucrat Syril, for instance. </p><p>And I was surprised to see, in what I think is a first for <em>Star Wars </em>as a series, <em>Andor</em> touching on how the fascist oppression of groups of people and sexual violence against women historically go hand in hand, with that vile Imperial officer Krole attempting to rape Bix. It was chilling, but I think <em>Andor’s </em>serious handling of its subject matter earned it the right to go there. </p><p>As for those “immoral” sacrifices you mentioned, what can I say? I love Luthen, and his willingness to do whatever he feels protecting the Rebellion demands. Him telling Mon Mothma “How nice for you” after he basically tells her, in his coded way, that he’s gonna have to take a certain liability out of the picture and she acts like she doesn’t quite understand what he’s saying is such a great moment, only made better by her trying to lose herself in booze and music right afterwards as some part of her struggled with the painful realization that her commitment to this rebellion had moral demands that went beyond even what she’d previously imagined.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I also loved the way <em>Andor </em>continues to show that the rebellion wasn’t some perfectly organized group of people all on the same page in the fight against the Empire. </p><p>Watching that ragtag group of rebels  break into arguments and then get into a protracted stand-off was a perfect reminder that part of the problem you face when fighting giant organized fascist empires is that you tend to have a lot of diverse people and ideas trying to work together. And that can cause people who should be on the same side to turn on each other</p><p>I also think it is interesting that for a show named <em>Andor</em>, he’s not that big a part of the first three episodes.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah! In that sense, these first three episodes did feel a bit like set-up, putting Cassian himself to the side a bit so they could both focus on laying the groundwork for Mon Mothma’s arc (I continue to be so impressed by the complexity of Genevieve O’Reilly’s performance) and in order to plant the seeds for...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501/slides/11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501/slides/11">something (ahem)</a></span> to happen on Ghorman later on.</p><p><strong> ZZ:</strong> Man, O’Reilly’s performance in this is so good. Who could have guessed that the actress George Lucas picked to play Mon Mothma—mainly because she looked so similar—for a few scenes that were mostly deleted from <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> would go on to be so incredible 20 years later. </p><p>Also, they should totally add that scene back into<em> Revenge of the Sith</em>. It’s a good scene and it would connect the movies to <em>Andor</em> in a fun way for people going back and re-watching them post-<em>Andor</em>.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It was really cool (in a horrifying way) hearing those Imperial propaganda experts talk about the ways in which they manipulate galactic opinion about Ghormans by leaning into and perpetuating negative stereotypes, another thing that <em>Andor </em>takes right from the history books about how fascism works. </p><p>And I do think these three episodes successfully generated suspense around Cassian’s absence, with his friends (and, of course, poor B2EMO!) feeling the pressure rise as they awaited him. I do hope he gets to decisively shift into a more prominent and active role with the next three episodes though!</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Let’s talk about that wedding.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/siddhantadlakha.bsky.social/post/3lngxbywwps2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/siddhantadlakha.bsky.social/post/3lngxbywwps2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIAMOS!</a></span></p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> DJ DROIDBOT! I was impressed and enjoyed that opening “oner” shot that walked us through the people at the wedding and revealed Luthen at the end. </p><p><strong>EG</strong>: Imagine having multiple principals on set to film at the same time!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Imagine having a set that big!</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>And talk about contrast. Superficially there’s the glitzy dancefloor, the wildly expensive statue, the performance of joy and celebration, but all the while there are such high-stakes political dimensions at play, and we really feel Mon Mothma working to stay focused on her political goals which are so much larger than herself, even as she’s dealing with the very real pain of a daughter who receives her coldly.</p><p> It’s grand and intimate all at once, balancing the human and the political dimensions very effectively which I think has long been a skill that sets Tony Gilroy apart. </p><p><strong>EG: </strong>She’s trying to create a better future for her daughter who is very content to live her comfortable life under the Empire.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Meanwhile she’s sold out her childhood friend for being in the midst of a late-life crisis. </p><p>I also liked the subtle look her husband gives her when she’s drunkenly dancing, like “Finally she’s doing what we all want her to do, just shut up and have fun.”</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Yes, that moment with her dancing and her husband watching stuck out to me. This is a side of Mothma we’ve never seen before. Even the actress said in a behind-the-scenes video that after doing that she learned more about Mothma. And I think we all did, too.</p><p>Now, for a part I didn’t like: The death of big man Brasso.</p><p>To be clear: I don’t mind the show killing characters. This is a rebellion against an evil empire. People are going to die. But I think it was just done really sloppily. I wasn’t even sure what happened. It was a rare moment in <em>Andor </em>where I felt like the direction just didn’t work. I was confused by the moment. Wait he’s dead? How? When? He was shot? I think? I don’t know... didn’t work for me. </p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Agreed; as a character, Brasso deserved to go out better (or at least more clearly) than that.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I get that the maybe the idea was, “Hey, look, heroes like Brasso can die just as randomly as nobodies.” Sure. Fine. That’s a good point. I get it. But yeah, what a confusing death for an awesome character. </p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Brasso had worse luck dodging blaster fire than the Jedi mowed down by Order 66.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Too soon, man. Too soon. </p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Everything else about the situation Brasso, Bix and the gang endured there really resonated though.</p><p> I like that <em>Andor </em>is a show that, on one hand, we can write <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501?_gl=1*1ygevn2*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4xLjE3NDU2MjA5NTUuNTkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501?_gl=1*1ygevn2*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4xLjE3NDU2MjA5NTUuNTkuMC4w">fun lists of <em>Star Wars </em>Easter eggs</a></span> about, and on the other, keeps offering direct parallels to how actual oppressive and fascist governments work. </p><p>The language the Imperials used about them being not just “undocumented” but “illegal” had me wanting to scream “No one is illegal!” at the screen, and Gilroy and co. are absolutely not being shy about making those connections as explicit as possible; that fucker Krole says something like “The Councils need the help or there’s no harvest. The help is undocumented,” driving home how migrant workers that are absolutely vital to industries like agriculture are often targeted.</p><p>Meanwhile, one thing I thought was really fun: the informative video about those spiders on Ghorman. It had the feel of the kinds of government-produced educational videos I’d sometimes see in class in elementary school.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I loved it! But also, I’m not sure why Krennic showed so much of it. Maybe he really likes spiders!?</p><p>Something I really appreciated about the meeting with Krennic and the other Empire members is how they aren’t all onboard, but others can sort of convince them to be worse. It’s subtle, but it shows how these decisions can happen. Even people who might think they are good, with enough power and in the wrong place, can agree to some horrible shit. And then they can say, “Well, it was a group decision.” Or blame it on the Empire and not themselves.</p><p>Okay, we’ve talked enough about themes and writing and direction etc etc. Can we talk about that Yavin-4 reveal?!</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Absolutely!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I’ll admit it: I made a noise. <em>Andor </em>is a show that so rarely does that kind of stuff that I squealed a bit. I’m a <em>Star Wars </em>sicko.  And I loved that reveal. I was so distracted by what was happening that I didn’t even notice the fact they didn’t reveal the planet’s name he landed on. And then I was like “Oh, you bastards!”</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I have to admit, it was pretty cool. </p><p>I’m not someone who gets excited about references for the sake of references but this felt earned somehow; it’s cool knowing that this seemingly random planet actually goes on to become a place of vital importance in the Rebellion’s future. It feels like one more thing that deepens Cassian’s legacy as a character whose experiences and actions echo on into the future, even if he doesn’t personally live to see how.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Also, I guess the rebels are going to have to kill a lot of giant lizard pig aliens things? Maybe that’s a whole episode. Andor and the gang hunting hogs.</p><p>(Also, pushes up glasses, it’s not a planet. It’s a jungle moon. Come on)</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Hahaha my bad! I always appreciate the depth of your <em>Star Wars</em> wisdom.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Deep cut to the main plot point of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em></p><p>How are we felling about the three-episode drop structure? It sort of extends the arc of them a bit, and makes for weaker individual episodes, but a possibly more nuanced and impactful 150 minutes? I’m not fully sold on it but I might also be too caught up in the high highs of season 1 which really didn’t kick in until mid way through.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I think it makes sense. Those first three episodes really felt like they had their own self-contained arc for me, and I expect the remaining three-episode drops will as well.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think it worked for me too. It basically is like a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie every week.</p><p>I also think it helps avoid a problem <em>Andor </em>had with some people in Season 1. That the show was too slow or took too long to get to big moments. Personally, I didn’t love the slower pace of the first two episodes of <em>Andor </em>season 1 but the third episode sold me on the show. So I think dropping them like this helps.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It’s also the sort of thing that may make more sense in retrospect, as the arcs of each three-episode cluster become clearer, with each group being set in a different year, if I remember right, as they count down to uhh...help me out here Zack, BBY 0, is that right?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Technically we are building to BBY1 as BBY0 is <em>A New Hope. </em>It’s weird. (And gets weirder when you realize that OBBY and 1ABY are sort of the same time period but not. Don’t think about this stuff.) </p><p>I’m glad you brought that up though, because I think this is the first time we’ve ever seen BBY show up in a show or movie. I wonder how many people were like “What?”</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I know! I was surprised to see them put something mostly only known to the die-hards up there.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>“3 Years Before Andor, the main character of this show, fucking dies” was Gilroy’s first choice, I’m told.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Can they get Gilroy to remake <em>Rogue One?</em></p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>We can’t wrap this up without talking about Syril and Meero!</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Oh right, that whole thing happened.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I saw some people online suggesting they aren’t a couple, which seems wild to me. It’s very clear those two are having some really aggressive and yet bland sex.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> He lives with her right?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think that’s what the show was implying, yeah.</p><figure id="" data-id="008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-recommend-id="image://008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-recommend-id="image://008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>CP: </strong>Right, what do we think is going on there? Him saying “We could...pretend you’re not back” kind of threw me off. Clearly the dynamics of their relationship are...odd, but I suspect they are together in some sense.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I’m curious to see where that whole thing goes. I care zero about his character, so I hope he is used more as a foil to bring interesting things out of her or force some unexpected developments.</p><p>“We could...pretend you’re not back” is what JD Vance’s couch used to say to him.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>I think Syril is fascinating <em>because</em> he’s so loathsome. Just a gross nepo loser who thinks he’s doing great and meaningful things while looking at spreadsheets. Truly a villain for the DOGE era.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think they are going to flip. He’ll learn about Ghorman and see it as a great thing. She seems hesitant. She might even flip on the Empire and him. Also, that moment where she smiles freaked me out.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> My favorite scene with her is after the meeting when she’s walking back on Coruscant with her boss and they show a clear split between the bureaucracy of the Empire and its autocrats.</p><p>Competent careerists who have to balance the ideology of the project and whims of their superiors with actually getting the results. Imagine if we come out of this whole thing with an attempted coup because it’s clear the Death Star is a really dumb idea.</p><p>“Push oppressed populaces to the brink to build giant weapon in space” is a reoccurring Icarus moment for fascists in the Star Wars universe.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I’d love to see a storyline like that. It’s something the movies/shows haven’t really touched on. That the Empire was once the Republic and not all of those people are suddenly on board with worshiping a melted monster man wizard god and his creepy black-suited super soldier dude.</p><p>The comics have touched on how the Empire’s various bureaucrats and soldiers don’t really get Darth Vader. Maybe Vader even shows up in the show at some point. He would be the one the Emperor would send to quash a coup.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>I’ve been wondering if that would happen. </p><p>I feel like that could go one of two ways. It could be awesome because yes, he’s such a powerful figure, he looms so large in the <em>Star Wars</em> mythos and tactically it would make sense, as you say. At the same time, part of what’s made <em>Andor </em>so great is that it largely avoids the kind of recurring major players from other <em>Star Wars</em> stories. Still, if Gilroy and co. decided to go that way, I’ll be curious to see how they handle it!</p><p>Before we wrap it up, just one last thing: I want to shout out a very good piece by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.UxZJ.tDX6BOOe9MXt&amp;smid=url-share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.UxZJ.tDX6BOOe9MXt&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Aftermath’s </em>Gita Jackson that ran in <em>The New York Times</em> a few days ago</a></span>.</p><p> They make the important point that simply watching a show like Andor is not, in and of itself, activism or resistance, an important thing to remember in an era when many people do seem to view “consuming” the right media as some kind of meaningful act. <em>Andor</em> is ultimately still itself the product of a massive corporate empire. But I do think we can totally recognize that fact while also letting ourselves feel stirred and inspired by the craft and artistry of what Gilroy and all of his collaborators on this project are doing. </p><p>I think about how in season one, for instance, Cassian was incarcerated, sentenced for several years (actually it probably would have been forever) for no reason at all, sent to a brutal prison colony that offered, ultimately, just one way out. I think if even a few young people are struck by parallels like those, feel something stirring inside them, and learn to know an evil empire when they see one, well, that would be pretty damn cool.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong><em>Andor</em> fans, welcome to the resistance.</p><p>But yes, I’m so happy this show is back for so many reasons. It’s very good. It makes me feel things. It comes at a perfect time. And I get to talk to people I know about <em>Star Wars</em> for a few weeks without them going, “Bleh, <em>Star Wars</em> is so bad/boring/whatever now.” That’s nice. So yeah, I think I speak for all of us when I say it’s awesome that <em>Andor </em>is back.  </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> added more than just an Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint to Croteam's classic puzzle game, The Talos Principle. It added a new suite of puzzles with the new In the Beginning expansion, which was made in collaboration with select members of the game's community.</p>
<p>16 out of the 18 puzzles included in the expansion are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">community-made</a>, and they also happen to be some of the most challenging puzzles within the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the puzzle Sequence Break. Before I go into the solution, if all you want is a hint, stop here before scrolling further.</p>
<p>The hint I'll give is that the puzzle's title already suggests its solution, but think of it as a 'recording break' instead of a 'sequence break.'</p>
<p>That's about as much of a hint I can give without giving away the whole solution, but if that's what you were looking for, then follow these steps below.</p>

The puzzle is mostly solved with elements on the left side of the room, right up until the final steps, where you'll head over to the right side to grab the tetromino once you've solved the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Nothing happens without the recorder, so start the recording and walk over to the connector standing on a pressure switch on your right. Pick up the connector and connect it to the red laser generator around the corner. Once it's set, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Leaving the connector where it is, walk over to the pressure switch it was initially on and stand on top of it. Create another pause point here. Once both pause points are set, grab the connector and place it back on the pressure switch so you can exit the area and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the recording plays, quickly grab the connector and stand at the end of the laneway across from where your recorded self will place the recorded connector. Use the connector to connect to the red laser and red node to your right, along with the recorded connector, and the red node on the opposite side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Play the recording until your recorded self is standing on the pressure switch, and walk back into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Then, continue the recording. Once your recorded self is off the pressure switch, instead of letting the recording play out, hit 'Stop' on the recorder. You should be left with the connector sending the red laser across the puzzle area to the node that will unlock the shield blocking the way to the tetromino, which is currently blocked by the shield that is deactivated with the pressure switch that sits in front of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Make a new recording. Walk over to the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area and stand on it to deactivate the shield. Create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Stop the recording, and let it play up to the pause point. Once it's there, your recorded self will have deactivated the shield, allowing the red laser to hit the node that will deactivate the shield to the tetromino.</li>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino to complete the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how you solve the Sequence Break puzzle in the new In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened. Like many of these puzzles, it's a clever trick that unlocks everything. In the case of Sequence Break, that trick is stopping the recording and not letting the entire thing play out, so you can have the red laser hitting the node across the puzzle room to the one that will unlock the path to the tetromino.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-sales-don%E2%80%99t-mean-a-boycott-has-failed.1174296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-xbox-microsoft-oblivion-bds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re basing your understanding of the gaming world on headlines and video titles alone, all you’d know about <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster is that a) people sure do love graphics, except b) a small but vocal contingent that can’t get past slightly tweaked gender options and, like, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lnnom7m2ks22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statue or something</a>. The game is by most measures <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-rockets-to-top-of-steam-sales-125042501002_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an enormous success</a>, a testament to the enduringly profitable power of nostalgia. But the gaming world is not the whole world. <em>Oblivion </em>is also a Microsoft product, and the Palestinian-led BDS movement is currently <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft#why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycotting the company</a>. If only a handful of people are talking about that, though, and it’s not having a tremendous impact on sales, what’s the point? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why covering and participating in these things still matters.</p><p>This week we’re joined by freelance writer Autumn Wright, author of a very good piece that ran on this very site titled <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Media Can’t Ignore BDS Xbox Boycott</a>, to discuss how that’s playing out in practice during the week of both <a href="https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a surprise-ish <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an indie dev removing his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a>. How should the press approach coverage of a big Microsoft release in the shadow of genocide? Which coverage is actually necessary versus which serves as glorified marketing? And what can a targeted boycott achieve when taking on a globally entrenched behemoth like Microsoft?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we briefly touch on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, which went live this week and led to no end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/563352/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-japan-warning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected</a> (and, let’s be real, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/564231/preorder-chaos-success-failure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected</a>) hassles. Finally, the mailbag forces us to reckon with the follies of our youth.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday put on a live show with a line outside comparable to that of one (1) GameStop location on Switch 2 preorder day.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>With <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, I think there was more acknowledgement [among the press] of its place within this sphere of potentially funding harm [than with the BDS Microsoft boycott], but then you look at the wider conversation around that game, and it was the press saying, “Hey, I don’t know if buying this is such a good idea,” the anti-wokes turning opposition to that idea into a giant crusade, and then the game selling, like, 13 million copies.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people who would have cared in either direction didn’t hear about any of this, so it was all not a wash necessarily – there was an impact – but what does that say about the press’ role in all of this? Because you also have people in chat right now saying that their friends don’t read articles; they watch a stream or a video. So much of the conversation around games is happening over there – most of it, even. With that in mind, how important is our role in all of this? How much does our work really impact anything?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> With [Rowling <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jk-rowling-uk-trans-women-ruling-rcna201947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping fund the war against trans people in the UK</a>] and the <em>Harry Potter</em> TV show, I’ve seen people be upset about all of that, but I haven’t read writeups of it. I don’t know if TV coverage is having the same [sort of moment games publications did around <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>]. JK Rowling funded something super bad, and it seems like such a clear line, whereas you could argue, if you felt so called, that the line from <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> to JK Rowling’s hatefulness is less direct. I don’t think you’d be correct. But in this case, it’s like, come on. We just had this thing. I haven’t seen a ton of TV writing about it, but I guess [the show] doesn’t exist yet.</p><p><strong>Autumn:</strong> I think that’s also gonna change very quickly now, with the news out of the UK last week. I see somebody in chat getting into the weeds of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, of the fact that there was no organized call to boycott, that it was a different kind of boycott. But again, [considering] the broader thing about orienting how we live to get to a world where people don’t live under someone else’s boot, why do you want to engage with<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em>? Have you noticed the amount of antisemitism and classism in there? I don’t mean that to talk down to you, but think about: Why do you have to play that game, specifically?</p><p>And if you really do start to dig into it, you will start to see that it is itself creating a world where trans people don’t exist, where people do live under boots, but they’re called house elves, so it’s fine – whatever. So let’s really think about how we’re getting to that. Art does influence the world, and it does tell us who gets to be human in fiction, which then shapes reality, and that shapes politics.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading just this past week <em>The Message</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a fantastic book about what writing and art can do. I recommend it to every writer just to read – really illuminating the actual importance of what we can do. But then we were talking five minutes ago about how writing and art can do all this stuff, but if no one reads it, what’s the point? At that point, I don’t know.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>My kind of solace is that all of these things can serve as building blocks over time – that if even a handful of people read my things [about the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster or an indie dev removing his game from the Xbox store], that could filter up to other people who maybe don’t internalize all of it, but they carry some seed of it forward, which ends up somewhere else, and over time you have this groundswell of thought or opinion that wouldn’t have existed otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we’ve actually seen that with <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, in a way. I think there is more open opposition now to JK Rowling than there was even a couple years ago when people were upset about <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. The latter almost certainly had a direct impact on the former. So there are some things that you’ve just gotta keep chipping away at, even if your pick is incredibly tiny. You do it because if you’re not doing it, you’re doing nothing, and then nothing happens.</p><p><strong>Autumn: </strong>You are creating the world you want to live in with very small actions, and that does build out. It makes me think of how, when we talk about the manosphere, people are like “Guys, you’ve gotta tell your friends that the thing they just said is really weird when they say it.” We’re doing that in small ways, by saying it’s weird that you are really invested in this [game] over the material harm that it’s [complicit in]. We should live in a world where we see oppression, and we react to it. We don’t just live with it, and we do take injustice anywhere as a threat to justice everywhere.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-gennojo-ally"><h3>Gennojo Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>No, you cannot join my club, you creep</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending"><h3>Does Blue Prince Never End?</h3></a><p>There is so much more to Blue Prince than the stated goal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There may be an exception for tabletop games being affected by the imposed US trade tariffs. These tariffs, which have already caused several board game companies to shutter, may not affect TTRPG books. However, there are some catches.</p>

<h2>TTRPG Books Potentially Exempt From Tariffs</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the Trump administration's 145% trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods have severely impacted the entire tabletop game industry. The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China then is imported back for delivery. But with import costs now more than double, companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> have paused board game production completely.</p>

This is a curious question since books are usually exempt from import costs due in part to how they are manufactured and their classification as cultural objects or means of technical information. In fact, printed books are on a limited list of products exempt from President Trump's trade tariffs via the executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-II.pdf" rel="nofollow">Annex II</a>.</p>

<p>This seems straightforward. Printed books are exempt from tariffs. TTRPG books are printed books, therefore, they are exempt. According to US Customs however, it is more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a ruling <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/ruling/085214" rel="nofollow">from 1989</a>, TTRPGs, referred to as "Fantasy Role Play Books" are not classified as printed books. The ruling states that the books are "designed to enhance fantasy game play, not for passive reading." This means the books are classified not as books but as "arcade, table, or parlor games... parts and accessories thereof," the same classification given to tabletop games.</p>

<p>This ruling is contradicted by more recent findings from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/563608/rpg-books-tariff-exclusions-shadowrun" rel="nofollow">Polygon's</a> own Nicole Carpenter. According to a 2024 Customs and Border Protection ruling, the <em>Shadowrun 6th Edition</em> Rulebook was classified as a printed hardbound book. This ruling applied, "only to the specific factual situation and merchandise description as identified in the ruling request."</p>

<p>Presuming this ruling isn't amended or overruled, that means TTRPG books may be exempt from the trade tariffs if they are imported and sold separately. No dice. No miniatures. No maps. No accessories included alongside the book.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the future of TTRPGs? Considering the ever-changing volatile landscape caused by the current administration, it is difficult to be certain. But, it may mean the cost of starter sets or TTRPG bundles may go up due to this quirk of US Customs.</p>

            <p>
GOG has announced a fresh wave of additions to its Preservation Program, including Capcom's classic RPG Breath of Fire 4, which returns to PC after an absence of over 20 years.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4, if you're currently drawing a blank, follows the adventures of a young man named Ryu (who usefully has the power to transform into dragons) as he attempts to stop an immortal emperor from destroying the world. The game is celebrating its quarter-century anniversary this year - having originally launched for PlayStation in Japan and the US back in 2000 - and GOG is marking the occasion by bringing it to PC for the first time since 2003.
</p>
<p>
GOG's Preservation Program is intended to provide "the best [versions of classic games] you can buy on any PC platform", and each features a range of enhancements intended to "guarantee convenience and compatibility with modern systems". In Breath of Fire 4's case, GOG is promising Windows 10 and 11 compatibility, "improved graphics powered by an upgraded DirectX renderer", as well as new display options including anti-aliasing, V-sync, windowed mode, and "refined" gamma correction.

<p>
Missing environmental sounds are also said to have been restored and new configuration options have been added as part of an audio engine upgrade, and players can choose between either English or Japanese localisations. And if that sounds like something you might be interested in, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 is available to purchase on GOG right now</a> for £8.99.
</p>
<p>
And it doesn't stop there. GOG has released a further nine titles as part of its Preservation Program, including Gremlin Interactive's stupendously weird 1996 haunted house mystery adventure <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/realms_of_the_haunting">Realms of the Haunting</a> - a sort of first-person shooter/point-and-click/FMV adventure hybrid, which pretty much consumed me back in the day. It's now gained the likes of cloud support, custom key mapping, and the ability to play either the US or UK version.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 and Realms of the Haunting arrive alongside upgrades for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_underworld_1_2">Ultima Underworld 1+2</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_9_ascension">Ultima 9: Ascension</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worlds_of_ultima_the_savage_empire">Worlds of Ultima : The Savage Empire</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_worlds_of_adventure_2_martian_dreams">Ultima Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_armageddon">Worms: Armageddon</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/robin_hood">Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stonekeep">Stonekeep</a>, and cult classic point-and-click FMV adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Tex%20Murphy:%20Under%20a%20Killing%20Moon">Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon</a>.
</p>
<p>
GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up. That list has continued to expand since then with a regular influx of new additions - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fear-platinum-joins-gog-preservation-program-to-properly-recognise-monoliths-contributions-to-gaming">Monolith Production's much-loved horror shooter FEAR</a>, which was added to "honour [the studio's] legacy" in February, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith's shock closure</a>.
