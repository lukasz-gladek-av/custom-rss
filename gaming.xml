<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has updated its policy on sexual harassment, and added a new category to its AutoMod tool, to improve safety on its platform.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/How-We-re-Combatting-Sexual-Harassment-on-Twitch?language=en_US">new blog post</a> titled "How we're combatting sexual harassment on Twitch", the streaming platform highlights clarifications to its policy.
</p>
<p>
"While our policy remains largely unchanged, these updates are designed to make the policy easier to understand," it reads. "Sexual harassment is never okay or acceptable. It harms our community, can make those targeted feel unsafe and disrespected, and can discourage them and others from participating on Twitch. We want our service to be the best and safest place to stream, and that means drawing clear boundaries around what behaviours are and aren't allowed."
</p>

<p>

To that end, additional language has been added to Twitch's sexual harassment policy, which defines sexual harassment as follows:
</p>
<p>
"We define sexual harassment to encompass non-physical behaviors of a sexual nature that cause users to feel uncomfortable, degraded, unsafe, or discouraged from participation. We prohibit unwanted comments-including comments made using emojis/emotes-regarding someone's appearance or body, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification, and negative statements or attacks related to a person's perceived sexual behaviours or activities, regardless of their gender. We also do not tolerate the recording or sharing of non-consensual intimate images or videos under any circumstances, and may report such content to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
In addition, the AutoMod tool - which automatically detects potentially harmful messages for mod review - now has a specific sexual harassment filter to help remove "unwelcome comments about someone's appearance, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification". It's currently only available in English.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's a timely addition for Twitch, which has faced criticism following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">an admission by high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that led to his ban from the platform. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-continued-to-send-sexually-explicit-messages-to-minor-after-their-age-was-known-former-twitch-employee-says">Later reports claimed he sent sexually explicit images</a> even after the age of the minor was known.


</p>
<p>
Of course, it should be noted these messages were in 2017 and Beahm was banned in 2020, so much has changed in the time since, with Twitch continuing to update its community guidelines and improve safety.
</p>
<p>
After attending <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">TwitchCon Europe this year</a>, a Twitch spokesperson emphasised to Eurogamer the importance of safety.

</p>
<p>
"Harassment has no place on Twitch, and we take enforcement of our harassment and hateful conduct policies seriously," said a Twitch spokesperson, detailing a number of features used to promote safety including Automod, Shield Mode, and follower verification. "These tools, in addition to our ongoing, 24/7 content moderation, help prevent harassment on Twitch. We continue to build on this work."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-update-104-tweaks-popular-valby-run-farming-method<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> developer Nexon has released update 1.0.4 across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S alongside the <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2608718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, below.</p><p>The patch tweaks the popular ‘Valby run’ farming method. Set in The Fortress Outpost on hard mode, the Valby run involves destroying generators and damaging the boss enough to trigger its ball immune phase, then using the character Valby’s ability to deal continuous damage while moving around the outer ring of the arena in an endless loop. With the Valby run farming method, players were able to gain hundreds of thousands of in-game gold and loads of XP in just a few minutes.</p><h2>The First Descendant update 1.0.4 patch notes in full:</h2><p><strong>Content Improvements</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Module storage limit has been increased from 1,000 to 1,500.</li><li>Cooldown for "Vulgus Strategic Outpost" has been reduced from five minutes to one minute.</li><li>Spawning time between monster respawn has been increased, and the reward amount has been adjusted at the "Vulgus Strategic Outpost."</li><li>Void Fragments will now drop when defeating monsters in Special Operation. There will be the most void fragment drops at the Special Operation "Neutralize Void Experiment."</li><li>Using "Mark for Arrest" item obtained from Special Operation will grant 10 times the usual amount of gold. When "Mark for Arrest" is used from ‘consumable’ tab, it will convert to 100,000 gold, and "High-Value Mark for Arrest" will convert to 1,000,000 gold.</li></ul><p>“With this adjustment, the reward amount at Fortress outpost has been reduced,” The First Descendant director Joo Min-seok explained.</p><p>“However, to ensure that ‘Valby run’ remains a popular hunting ground like Ambush Point and Refined Run, we have set the reward efficiency significantly higher than originally intended. We hope to provide numerous farming spots in The First Descendant, each with unique characteristics and usefulness to different Descendants. Instead of reverting Valby run to its original design intent, we have adjusted it to offer similar efficiency to other high-reward hunting grounds.</p><p>“Additionally, we have shortened the cooldowns for all outposts so that players can play them more frequently without deliberately failing and no longer need to search for outposts with shorter cooldowns by moving around the map. We have also added gold rewards to Special Operations and adjusted four types of Void Fragments to be randomly dropped, allowing players to choose and utilize various hunting grounds.</p><p>“Through issues like the Fortress Outskirts and Valby run, we are learning what kind of playstyle our players enjoy. The experience of sweeping through and farming monsters is of significant value in our game.</p><p>“Your feedback and interest are what drive the continuous improvement of The First Descendant. We will always listen to your feedback and improve the game.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The experience of sweeping through and farming monsters is of significant value in our game.</p></div><p>Joo Min-seok also offered a week five preview for The First Descendant, which goes live next week and adds a new Descendant called Luna. The details are below:</p><h2>The First Descendant week five update patch notes preview:</h2><p><strong>Sea of Emerald, "Ultimate Valby"</strong></p><p>Finally, the Magisters have completed the ultimate project for Valby. This ultimate equipment, called "Sea of Emerald," has fulfilled Valby's long-held desire. It is a nano suit that replicates Valby’s former body color and texture. Although covered in a thin layer, Valby feels like regaining a long-forgotten part of herself.</p><p><strong>Ultimate Valby’s Modification Modules</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spiral Tidal Wave: Replaces the Bubble Bullet, which was difficult to aim, with a projectile that flies straight. Spiral Tidal Wave attracts the impurities of Gluttony, making it an excellent choice for intercepting Gluttony.</li><li>Hydro Pressure Bomb: Instead of "Plop Plop," it leaps forward and deals damage to enemies around the landing area. The more enemies in the laundry state, the more powerful the damage, making Hydro Pressure Bomb a strong finishing blow. Instead of diving into the water, leap joyfully forward!</li></ul><p><strong>A New Descendant, "Luna"</strong></p><p>The Mad Artist Luna has returned to Albion after a long wandering performance. Luna's synthesizer gun becomes more powerful when fired in rhythm, enhancing allies' abilities based on the performance. When Luna dances to upbeat music, allies' skill power increases, and when dancing to relaxing music, allies' mentality recovers and resource consumption decreases. Invite everyone to Luna's concert. Unfortunately for Virgus, it will be their last stage, but Luna's performance is just beginning!</p><p><strong>Luna’s Modification Modules</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nimble Footsteps: Enhances Luna's mobility and amplifies the effect range of her performance, allowing for more effective ally support.</li><li>Noise Surge: Transforms Luna from a supporter to a combat dealer. Dashes towards enemies in rhythm, dealing damage to nearby enemies. When the inspiration gauge is full, summons a stage to recover mental strength and shields. Provide enemies with a terrifying musical experience with Noise Surge!</li></ul><p><strong>Gluttony</strong></p><p>The mutated Devourer-type Gluttony is a giant that indulges in Void Energy. It is equipped with systems to mine Void Energy and a cooling system to cool the heat generated during this process. To counter Gluttony, you need measures to withstand its cooling performance and the judgment to exploit its greedy temperament. Intercept Gluttony and collect new ultimate weapons and external components.</p><p><strong>New Ultimate Weapon "Peace Mediator"</strong></p><p>When meditation is necessary to bring peace to Ingris, the new ultimate weapon Peace Mediator is the perfect solution. This powerful hand cannon is effective even with single shots but can unleash a burst of bullets to deliver powerful firepower under the right conditions.</p><p><strong>New Ultimate Module "Arche Concretion"</strong></p><p>Provides Arche Concretion effect, which increases defense and mentality when using skills but decreases movement speed and attack power. It is particularly useful for Luna and Ajax and can be a good choice for players who want stable skill use. Your choices are free; combine various Modules to create your unique build.</p><p><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></p><p>In the week five update, we have decided to make balance adjustments for some Descendants and Ultimate weapons.</p><p>First, we are adjusting Valby, Blair, and Freyna, who use AOE as their main skills. We hope to see these Descendants more effectively dominate the battlefield, creating large AOE zones and leisurely watching enemies fall from the rear. Look forward to improved performance for these wide-range covering Descendants.</p><p>Additionally, there will be improvements to Ultimate weapons that enhance critical hit chance and damage. Enduring Legacy (machine gun), Secret Garden (tactical rifle), and Nazeistra's Devotion (hand cannon) will be improved to boast more powerful firepower with critical settings.</p><p>Moreover, Greg's Reversed Fate (tactical rifle) will be adjusted to activate its unique effect in more chances. We are also improving the functionality of single-shot weapons, allowing players to choose between single-shot and rapid-fire modes. Please look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Lastly,</strong></p><p>There will also be more improvements for convenience to be included in the week 5 update. Plus, new cosmetics that many players have been waiting for will be out, so please wait just one more week!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies"><u>with over 10 million players in just 10 days</u></a>. But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters. Last week, IGN reported on one player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-community-reacts-in-disbelief-as-one-player-grinds-for-200-hours-to-unlock-every-ultimate-descendant"><u>who spent an eye-watering 200 hours to unlock every Ultimate Descendant currently available in the game without paying money</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Are you looking for an intensive game for your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> night, made by a renowned game design team that has created several popular tabletop games? Scythe may be just that for the dedicated and patient board game crew. The design team at <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stonemaier Games</u></a> has created multiple other games my board game group has played, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">Wyrmspan</a> (the dragon version of Wingspan), and Viticulture.</p><p>Like some of their other games, Scythe is aimed at more experienced players who are willing to invest some time in it. It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a> based in Eastern Europe which involves elements of war. The game is pushed forward through engine building and completing objectives by gathering and creating resources, engaging in battles, working toward popularity, and strategically coordinating workers, a main character connected to a specific faction (each with their own powers), and mechs to journey across the board.</p><p>The base game can be played <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> or with up to five players. It’s versatile if game night gets cancelled, and you still want to play anyway. That said, the game is heavy – literally and figuratively. The box with its components is heavy. The gameplay is quite complex. Setup, learning, and actual gameplay will take longer. This one is not recommended for less experienced gamers. There is only one version where this is an exception, as that version is an alternative <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">board game for kids</a>. We’ll get to that later on in our comprehensive guide.</p><p id="scythe-base-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Scythe: Base Game">Scythe: The Base Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ed704fba-30df-42c0-9afc-eb783b73fa27" id="205124"><div id="205124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $99.00 USD</li><li>1-5 Players </li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>As mentioned, the base game is complex. Given its higher price tag, it will also be a bigger investment to start playing than some of the other board games listed in our other buying guides. This is likely tied to the figures inside the box, which can be painted to a player's liking.</p><p>You should get the base board game and learn it before you explore the expansions. Knowing how this original works will help you understand and connect with the other available expansions. </p><h2>Scythe Expansions</h2><p>Expansions can add more obstacles to the game. Some expansions also allow even more players to join the fun. Scythe has three expansions available.</p></div><p id="scythe-invaders-from-afar-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion">Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="dcbee0af-a471-450e-b399-2be9f625b6f7" id="205126"><div id="205126" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $35.00 USD</li><li>1-7 Players</li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 10 paintable plastic miniatures, two new player factions, additional pieces allowing for two more players, including mats and tokens- making the max amount of players up to seven</p><p>After getting the hang of the base system, add the first expansion: Invaders from Afar.

It adds additional depth to the game with campaign capacities (8 campaigns) and modular play (11 modules), which can be used alongside other expansions. One of the modules is a cooperative module instead of a competitive one.</p><p>You will need the base game to play it, like other expansions. Rise of Fenris can host five or seven players as well as solo play, depending on whether all of the expansions are owned. </p><h2>Other Scythe Games</h2><p>Two other Scythe games are available, operating as separate titles that do not require the base game.

It’s a stand-alone game that takes place years after the original when a meteorite crashed near the Siberian Tunguska River. This game is completely separate from Scythe and requires no previous knowledge to play it.</p><p>Expeditions is an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine building board game</a> with different mechanics, objectives, and navigation. You’re working towards vanishing corruption in the area, enhancing your mechs powers through quests, gaining power, and building up worker capacities to acquire the most money and treasure to win the game. The game can be completed in about half the time as its predecessor. </p></div><p id="my-little-scythe"><h3 data-toc-title="My Little Scythe">My Little Scythe</h3></p><div catalogid="9caad0d3-c7fe-4540-a52d-4d5c28cc1642" id="205130"><div id="205130" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My Little Scythe</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $60.00 USD</li><li>1-6 Players</li><li>55 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 14 paintable miniatures, a painting guide, an achievement sheet, custom apples, gems, mats, tokens, boards and cards</p><p>The kid's version of Scythe is a far less complicated game that turns the popular original into a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-friendly board game</a> that can be played with kids as young as eight. It incorporates animal characters to use with limited actions in a colorful journey involving pies, magic, castles, and friendship. While the game has war-like elements as they find and establish new homes, the fighting aspect is reduced to a quirky alternative: pie fights. </p><p>While this game has some fun elements, including the ability to share the joy of painting miniatures with your family, it’s not without its balance of good and places to bid caution. </p><p>This younger version can be played solo or with up to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>. It also plays in half the time that its adult counterpart titles do. However, quite a few pieces are still in the box. As a mom who knows the pain of wrangling parts in games with her own kids, I can warn you this is something that you’ll want to keep in mind during your family game night.</p></div><p id="my-little-scythe-pie-in-the-sky"><h3 data-toc-title="My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky">My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="f8bc9788-6f59-448e-b6fb-f8fc0ff432aa" id="205131"><div id="205131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $20.00 USD</li><li>1-6 Players</li><li>45-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: two new paintable miniatures (owls and arctic foxes), one airship miniature, nine airship mats, five airship gadget tokens, four additional power-up tiles, two new quest cards, seventeen trophy tokens, rulebooks, and an achievement sheet</p><p>It’s the eve of a Harvest Tournament, and your animals seek to find new homes in the kingdom. Some time has passed since their last adventure, though. Now your animals have access to sky travel in the form of, you guessed it, airships. Some new animals have also joined the fun in this edition, which is playable for up to six players.</p><p>You need the base game to play the Pie in the Sky expansion. This expansion is also a far more accessible price point for many parents. </p><h2>More Ways to Play</h2><p>Scythe and its expansion, Invaders from Afar, can played on Steam in two different ways. The Polish development team, The Knights of Unity, developed a standalone and DLC version.  That base game of Scythe on <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdMVD?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Steam</a> is $19.99. The expansion, Invaders from Afar, is also <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZR34n?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">available as DLC</a> that can be added to the base game for an additional $9.99. </p><p>This digital version on Steam also features a lengthy tutorial. It took me about an hour to get through it when I ran through it. It’s a complex, slow-moving game with many moving pieces and mechanics. The tutorial, despite being long, was immensely helpful in helping me navigate and learn game mechanics for the base game and the expansion. </p><p>The Steam version offers the ability to play the game solo against up to 6 players (when you have the expansion and the base game), which can be any combination of AI bots or local human players. Players can also pair up with folks online if they choose to. You’ll have an extra step to set up for online play. Online play will require you to register with AsmoConnect and create an account to play online.</p><p>The game and several expansions (Invaders from Afar, Scythe: The Rise of Fenris, Scythe: The Wind Gambit, Scythe: The Wind Gambit + Invaders from Afar) as well as its sequel Expeditions and the version for younger players called My Little Scythe can also be played on the browser-based board game platform <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMeyV?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Tabletopia</a>. Tabletopia operates as a different subscription-based service on multiple platforms. It has three tiers from which interested players can choose. Each level tier gives folks different capacities to play games. </p><p>You can get a Bronze level membership, allowing you to play two simultaneous game sessions for free. In the case of Scythe, it will allow you to play the base game of Scythe (2 players with Crimea vs Nordic), the kid's version of Scythe for up to 7 players, and the sequel’s demo edition for up to players for free. </p><p>You’ll need a Silver or Gold tier subscription to play the other editions and the capacity to play. The Silver tier subscription, which costs $9.97 monthly, gives you access to premium games. The Gold level subscription costs $14.97 monthly, allowing subscribers to add guests to premium games. </p><p>Tabletopia also has Scythe as a playable game in its Premium collection on Steam. The Premium level subscription on Steam is $14.97 monthly, but don’t worry about double spending! You can connect your Steam and browser accounts and pay only one monthly fee of $14.97.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The popularity of the Scythe series is nuanced. For one, the art is absolutely gorgeous. The capacity for players of multiple age groups to add to it with paintable figurines adds a layer of customizable beauty. The game was made by board game designer <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/about/staff/jamey-stegmaier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamey Stegmaier</a> who is extremely interactive with the community. The team at Stonemaier has several other strong titles in its catalogue. I can see why the game received its 8.1 rating on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the learning curve is quite considerable. The online tutorial was tremendously helpful in its stand-alone version via The Knights of Unity Steam version. Learning to play it via Tabletopia was far more difficult as you had to learn how to play the game and move pieces without the help of a program that helped to do that for you. I’m not sure I would feel comfortable playing that version with younger kids via the browser version of Tabletopia or their Steam version, even though the kid's version is among the free games on the base-level subscription.</p><p>In its physical form, Scythe is also a massive game that requires considerable investment in purchase, storage space, and keeping all those pieces together, especially in the kids' version. The company offers a way to get replacement parts; however, the price of those parts is not immediately visible, so it’s unknown how much it would cost if multiple things went missing after a chaotic game night.</p><p>Seasoned and patient players will likely enjoy the game. It’s worth giving a chance, especially if you can partner with a friend or two who are already familiar with it to help you learn the ropes. Try it out at a board game cafe, or see which of your friends already owns it and try theirs. Seasoned gamers will likely know at least one person with a copy in their friend circle. I found several who did in mine when I initially asked about it!</p><p>Lastly, the younger version counterpart is also incredibly cute. It softens up the war aspects of the game for players who might want a less abrasive alternative that takes less time to complete regardless of their age. Sure, mechs are cool, but pie fighting with animals is quite a delightful spin on an otherwise heavier topic.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

                <p>PC gaming handhelds have proven to be quite popular, and if you're looking for a deal on one of the newer models, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Claw-Gaming-Handheld-Thunderbolt/dp/B0CXG3DBQV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw right now at Amazon for just $600</a>. Normally $750, this is a big discount on MSI's most-powerful version of the Claw, as it features the Intel Core Ultra 7 chipset and a 512GB SSD. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036387812563663%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy is also offering the same model</a>, but it's priced at $650 on that site.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4338886-msi-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4338886" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4338886-msi-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4338886"></a><figcaption>MSI Claw</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4338886-msi-claw.jpg"></figure><p>When it first launched, one of the main criticisms of the MSI Claw was that it was simply too expensive, especially when compared to the ROG Ally or the Steam Deck and its OLED model. With this big discount, MSI is now being more competitive with its big handheld unit, which has a seven-inch screen and a more comfortable design. While MSI is still working to catch up to Asus and Steam when it comes to overall performance, recent updates have helped improve the quality of the gaming experience.</p><h2>MSI Claw Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Claw-Gaming-Handheld-Thunderbolt/dp/B0CXG3DBQV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 512GB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Amazon)</a> -- $600 ($<strike>750</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036387812563663%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 512GB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Best Buy)</a> -- $650 ($<strike>750</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036414014400035%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 1TB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Best Buy)</a> -- $750 ($<strike>800</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036358203348049%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw 512GB Intel Core Ultra 5 processor</a> -- $600 ($<strike>700</strike>)</li></ul><p>In addition to its comfortable design, the MSI Claw also has Hall Effect joysticks, high-quality face buttons, and stereo speakers that can deliver an impressive level of sound.

<p>A new report from WIRED has claimed that Activision has used AI-generated skins to sell in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, Activision Blizzard started using AI in its games in early 2023 and, by late 2023, had reportedly sold its first AI-generated cosmetic skin in its latest title, Modern Warfare 3. The report heavily implies that the skin “Yokai’s Wrath” was created in part by AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One former Activision employee who worked on Modern Warfare 3 tells me that the timeline of WIRED’s reporting is correct and that leadership boasted about AI in its townhall meetings. “I recall during a townhall, leadership boasted about using A.I tools like Midjourney, etc to streamline production timelines,” it was said.</p>



<p>Weekly emails across the studios also consisted of AI-generated skins, they continued.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many Call of Duty skins or cosmetics have been created or inspired by AI. Still, developers tell me that it wasn’t uncommon to be “encouraged” to use AI tools to make some creative processes more efficient. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>, including those at Activision Blizzard. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>

<p>A reliable Xbox Game Pass leaker has claimed that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on August 8.</p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815874694349770896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who has become incredibly accurate about Xbox Game Pass leaks. </p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, the leaker said, “100% CONFIRMED. C<strong>rash Bandicoot n sane trilogy w</strong>ill be available on Gamepass on August 8, 2024. I’m going to remember it because I didn’t post an individual tweet about it and perhaps some have not seen the video where I mentioned it, I give myself the luxury of confirming it as well.”</p>



<p>In early July, the same leaker claimed that the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy would be coming to Xbox Game Pass in August, a rumor corroborated by other leakers and journalists. The date has since been doubled-down on, though, with the more recent tweet confirming the date.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Xbox announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-officially-announced-for-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, too, which was a rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>When other Activision games will be available on Xbox Game Pass, Insdier Gaming understands that the game library will be trickled to Game Pass subscribers over the next several months. However, there’s still some uncertainty about the older Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy on Xbox Game Pass?</p>

            <p>All 36 employees of Humble Games publishing have reportedly been laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">According to</a> business developer Nicola Kwan, staff were informed at 9am this morning, and told that “the company is shutting down.” Humble dispute this in a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bumble-shuts-down-game-publishing-label">Game Developer</a>, claiming that the publishing label is "undergoing restructuring," as opposed to a full shutdown.</p>
<p>Humble’s statement - which you can read in full <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">here</a> - attributes the events to “challenging economic times for indie game publishing,” saying that “Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Humble Games is operated by Ziff Davis, who also own the Gamer Network stable of websites, including Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<p>Chris Radley, who was Humble’s creative lead up until 2022, is among those who are publicly disputing this framing. “I want it to be made abundantly clear,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/">wrote Radley</a>. “this is NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of HumbleGames. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left.”</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">to Aftermath</a>, an unnamed employee called the ‘restructuring’ claims an effort to “save face.” Aftermath report that former employees told them that Humble Games had not signed any projects for 2026 or 2027. "With [parent company Ziff Davis's] stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development,” said one anonymous employee. </p>
<p>Aftermath also obtained a recording of the morning meeting, in which Ziff Davis' technology and shopping division president Steve Horowitz said that the company had attempted to sell Humble Games twice before, but “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome." Horowitz also said that Humble's remaning publishing projects are being handed over a third-party consulting firm the Powell Group.</p>
<p>Humble Games, a publishing label under The Humble Bundle brand, has put out games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forager">Forager</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a>.</p>
<p>As Game Developer point out, this is Humble Games’s second round of layoffs in recent months, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-games-lays-off-valued-colleagues-as-restructuring-begins">following the firing</a> of an “unspecified number of staff from its publishing arm” last November.</p>
<p>“Another year, another lay off! Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">wrote</a> Senior QA Emilee Kieffer. “The game industry is volatile, it's been inundated by people who only want exponential growth at the expense of making great games with great teams. Billionaires and CEOs are making record profits at the expense of the employees who actually create the products. But I believe we have the power to create studios that benefit us as game developers and not people that only see us as money printing machines.”</p>

            <p>
Mario + Rabbids lead developer Davide Soliani is leaving Ubisoft after 25 years.
</p>
<p>
Soliani spent 11 years working on the two Mario + Rabbids games, released on Switch in 2017 and 2022 in conjunction with Nintendo. The developer is yet to reveal what he'll be working on next, beyond embarking on "a new adventure".
</p>
<p>
"Hi all folks.

Soliani posted his statement alongside the iconic image of himself captured at the Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle reveal at Ubisoft's 2017 E3 presentation (above video), in which Mario creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> praised his work. The very sweet moment became a bit of a meme afterwards as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Ubisoft Crying Man</a> - and a year later Eurogamer Editor-in-Chief Tom Phillips interviewed Soliani about his work.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a> received a positive response and became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-is-switchs-best-selling-non-nintendo-game">best-selling third-party game on Switch</a> at the time. It was quickly followed up by a sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review-snooker-in-space">Sparks of Hope</a>.


</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">Ubisoft later admitted the sequel underperformed by comparison</a>, with CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledging the company "should have waited" for the next Nintendo console.

</p>
<p>
"We had already released a Mario Rabbids game [on Switch], so by doing another we had two similar experiences on one machine. On Nintendo, games like this never die. There are 25 Mario games on Switch," said Guillemot.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo [has advised] that it's better to do one iteration on each machine. We were a bit too early, we should have waited for [the next console]."
</p>
<p>
Sparks of Hope has since received multiple DLCs, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raymans-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-dlc-get-august-release-date">return of Ubisoft icon Rayman</a>.

            <p>The latest free update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> will let you "define the conditions under which your Sims become jealous". That's handy. The new feature, called "Romantic Boundaries", will give you some settings to tweak that determine whether a Sim will be bothered when they see their partner flirting with the neighbour, or kissing the neighbour, or getting into bed with the neighbour, or becoming a blur of obscene pixels with the neighb- okay Cindy, stop! I'm not comfortable with this. When I said we could open up I didn't mean with <em>Nigel</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can make it so Sims will get bothered by "non-physical romance", such as a stranger complimenting their appearance. Or you can limit jealousy to kick in only when "physical romance" begins, like kissing and holding hands. Or you can switch it all off completely to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsdKycVZZ4">the polyamorous couple of your dreams/nightmares</a>. </p>
<p>By default, any existing Sims in your saved games will all be fiercely jealous monogamous types. But newly created rando-Sims will vary on what they consider cheaty behaviour. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1222670/view/4377019664797445936">patch notes go into more detail</a>, but basically the new options appear in the character creation screen, alongside "Gender" and "Sexual orientation". The patch also changes some of the language of relationships to be more neutral, with "husband" and "wife" keywords getting replaced with the simple "spouse", while "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" have become "partner". </p>
<p>There are  other quality of life changes when it comes to relationships. "Previously, the Partners relationship could only be established through gameplay," say the developers. "Now you can set it within Create a Sim between two Sims in your household." That's useful for setting up a couple straight off the bat.</p>
<p>This all comes ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-lovestruck-expansion-adds-a-dating-app-and-outdoor-woohoo">the paid Lovestruck DLC</a>, which is coming out tomorrow and is due to add a bunch of new dating options for romance-focused Sims. They can use a new dating app, for example. And you'll be able to set your wee peoples' "turn-ons" and "turn-offs" to help determine exactly how their romantic entanglements shake out. But that's all the paid stuff - today's patch is a free update to the base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a>, basically prepping the ground for the new features the DLC will add.</p>
<p>Alongside the changes, there are a bunch of other fixes and rejigs. As is my custom, here are the ones I found most enjoyable when read out-of-context. </p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to customize Toddler Toenails has returned.</li>
<li>Professors no longer run away when attempting to take them on a date.</li>
<li>Sims on Horses no longer socialize with Sims through walls.</li>
<li>Ghost Sims are now available for "Ask on Date..." from the Relationship Panel.</li>
<li>Lips are synced so that Sims making out keep their lips on their kissing partner. No more awkwardly talking mid-kiss!</li>
<li>When Sims get steamy in the shower from WooHoo, music now jazzes up the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I say, the Lovestruck expansion pack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/">out tomorrow on Steam</a>, and costs £35. Turns out money <em>can</em> buy you love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield's next update is apparently going to add the land vehicles that were talked about a while back to aid players in their exploration endeavors.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSodiumStarfield/comments/1eaiixf/leaked_screenshot_of_a_black_buggy_different_from/">NoSodiumStarfield subreddit</a>, buggies are coming in the next update, which will launch on a yet to be confirmed date. The buggies will come in two variants and are two passengers only, with a third optional passenger slot left for Vasco. NPCS from rescue missions will also be able to ride the buggy. Both buggy variations will have their weapons, a laser mode with slowdown and a launcher, and they will scale depending on the player's certified skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Starfield land vehicles will be easy to obtain and transport around, as just buying them from the ship technicians will make them spawn near the ship. Sadly, customization options seem to be limited to colors, as anything that will sport a new part will essentially be considered a new vehicle. Lastly, the leaker said that buggies seem to be working well, unlike Skyrim's horses, so it seems like they will be a more than viable way to explore the game's many planets.</p>
<p>Alongside the leaked information, <a href="https://gyazo.com/90ed59f3cd0dbe947a5911aba97fc892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a screenshot</a> showcasing one of the buggies that are supposedly coming to Starfield in the next update was shared online, giving slightly more validity to a 4chan leak that wouldn't have been considered reliable otherwise. Still, it's best to take everything with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle. </p><p>This bundle was sold for 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that Wired did not specify which part of this bundle was AI-generated, or indeed whether all of it was. The bundle contained a number of virtual items, including an Operator skin, a weapon blueprint, a calling card, a weapon sticker, and a loading screen, all below.</p><p>IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/screenshot-2024-07-24-094251-1721810585928.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Yokai’s Wrath bundle. Image credit: <a href="https://codmwstore.com/operators-identity/yokais-wrath/">codmwstore.com</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs are being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p>“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p>Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-generative-ai-can-be-used-in-creative-ways-but-highlights-ip-issues">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company’s initiatives involving AI</a>.

Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.</p></div><p>Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent">The game failed</a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p>Video game console makers Microsoft and Sony are all-in on AI.

<p>"A hot-blooded, hellishly twisted, feverishly filthy, love and hate filled road trip," is how the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535440/Shadows_of_the_Damned_Hella_Remastered/">Steam page</a> describes it. "Join the crass Garcia Hotspur and his boney buddy, Johnson, as they traverse the depths of the Underworld to steal back Garcia's kidnapped lover, Paula, from the clutches of Fleming, the Lord of the Underworld. Let the soul of rock 'n' roll run loose in the heart of the twisted hellscape that is the Underworld." The page does not feature any quotes of Garcia referring to his gun as  "My Big Boner," but this does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>Shadows Of The Damned was a collaboration between Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a>’s Shinji Mikami. Famously, there was reportedly a bit of tension during development between the studio and publisher EA. Suda cleared up some details in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ur7Mubc3mi4">recent interview with GhenryPerez</a> on YouTube, going into a few elements he wishes he’d manage to retain - including a gun with a tiny version of the character Paula inside, who would communicate with the player. Suda was forbidden to keep this in the game, being told "You guys don't understand... Americans hate little girls!"</p>
<p>In the process of googling a fact for this piece, I turned up this old<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/shadows-of-the-damned-screens"> EA press page</a> thing from 2011 that describes the game as "a mind-shattering adventure that has to been seen to be believed," in the way only something written about a videogame in 2011 could.</p>
<p>Back in March, the credits for Shadows Of The Damned: Hella Remastered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-after-leaving-evil-within-and-hi-fi-rush-devs-resident-evil-legend-shinji-mikami-has-founded-a-new-studio">revealed that </a>Shinji Mikami had started a new studio, a year after leaving the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">now shuttered</a>) Tango Gameworks - who Edwin argued <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">deserved to be remembered</a> for far more than just Mikami’s contribution.</p>

            <p>
The remaster of 2011 action-adventure Shadows of the Damned is set to release this Halloween.
</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-the-damned-remaster-announced">Grasshopper Manufacture announced the remaster last year</a>, which will release across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's a cult-classic demon-shooting game written by Suda 51 (Killer 7) and produced by Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil).
</p>
<p>
News of the release date - and live pre-orders - was included in a new trailer filled with gore and screams. I'm not joking, you might want headphones for this one.

<figcaption>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpT42plQiI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The trailer includes some new footage of the remaster, including some of its new costumes.
</p>
<p>
It also lists various amusing job titles for the team: Mikami, for instance, is Mentor of Masters, Thief of Awards, and Spiritual Guru, among others. Suda 51, meanwhile, is a part-time influencer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned follows lead character Garcia Hotspur, a Mexican demon hunter who visits the City of the Damned to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming.
</p>
<p>
It's all very silly, combining some psychological horror with a punk rock aesthetic - if that wasn't already abundantly clear from the trailer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned was followed a year later by Lollipop Chainsaw, another Suda 51 action game. That's also set to receive a remaster, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, which will be out in September across PC via Steam, PS5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-complete-ray-tracing-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Assassin's Creed Mirage looks decent enough, its visuals are most definitely not on the same level as those of games such as Cyberpunk 2077. Still, with some mods, it is possible to make the game look stunning on PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Dreams</a> recently shared a new video showcasing the latest entry in the series running at 8K resolution and with a variety of mods such as ReSTIR G.I. better Ray Tracing and Complete RT, a custom reshade preset that improves color grading, an immersive camera mod and others. Needless to say, the end results look incredible.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] AC Mirage: RAYTRACING Mod | Complete RT | RTX 4090 |  ULTRA GRAPHICS OVERHAUL 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUnctTma7Bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage brought the series back to its roots, doing away with the role-playing game mechanics introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins to offer an experience that is closer in every possible way to the first entries in the series, which are still considered to be the best by many. Despite the game not making a very good first impression, it is still a solid game that grows on the player, as highlighted by Nathan in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>"Do you fancy playing as a couple of skellies named 'The Boner Brothers' riding a bike and sidecar while chunky bastard-metal blasts out, also they’ve got a gun, also they can do tricks?" asked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/motordoom">Motördoom</a>, to which I became so instantly hyperactive I somehow worked out how to headbutt my own face. Of course I want to put a chainsaw on the front of my bike, Motördoom. Obviously I want a rougelike-able upgrade that perchance may set my demonic enemies on fire. Yes, I’d like to combine a sick manual with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> killstreak for a very large combo, Motördoom. Is this what overly concerned parents thought PS1 games were actually like? If I got a disc with this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">demo</a> on as a kid, I’d be significantly radder than I am today. Gnarly, even. Made of gnarls.</p>

<p>"Motördoom is a freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," which, must be said, might the pitch to end all pitches. I must ask, though: why is the crucial umlaut absent from the actual Steam title? It’s a mystery, though not one I’m willing to unpack right now. I’m playing Motördoom, you see.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Motördoom Release Date Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNpSXIgUSGY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>"Combine your trick combo with kills to earn even more points. Once you land your combo, gain experience points as high as the combo score. Earn enough points and you'll be given the choice of one of three random Demonic Offerings," continues the umlaut-less Steam page. "These upgrades grant you more power to defeat the ever growing horde of grotesque monsters. So jump up in the air, slow down time and shoot these demonic abominations!"</p>
<p>I will say that, on balance, Motördoom is roughly 20% less rad to play than it actually looks. It feels a little floaty, a little awkward to control, although I’ll freely admit I’m likely just very bad at it. It’s already sold me enough on the concept enough to get better at it though. And yet, 20% less than almost irresponsibly rad is still very rad. I await its full release with bated umlauts.</p>

            <p>
Sony has released its latest PlayStation 5 system software update, introducing shareable links so players can invite others to quickly jump into their multiplayer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Sony first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-shareable-links-will-let-recipients-join-multiplayer-games-without-being-psn-friends">revealed</a> it was working on shareable multiplayer links for PlayStation 5 back in May. And now, two and a bit months later, the feature (albeit seemingly with certain announced elements still to come) is here as part of the snappily titled 24.05-09.60.00 PS5 update.
</p>
<p>
"To invite other players [to a game]," explains Sony's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">patch notes</a>, "open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link." The company notes the feature only works for open sessions that anyone can join.

<p>
Away from shareable links, Sony's latest PS5 update adds the ability to open Game Help action cards using voice commands. Users just need to say "Show Game Help" to get started.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the company promises improved messages and usability on "some" screens, updated device software to improve stability for "some" DualSense wireless controllers, plus - because you can never have too much stability - improved system software performance and stability too. And if you prefer patch notes formatted as Sony orginally intended, see below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Version: 24.05-09.60.00</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can invite other players to game sessions by sharing a URL to the session. </li>
<ul>
<li>To invite other players, open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link.</li>
<li>This feature is available only for open sessions that anyone can join. </li>
<li>This feature will gradually be rolled out to all players by July 24.</li>
</ul>
<li>Voice Command now supports the ability to open Game Help action cards by saying "Show Game Help". </li>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Voice Command (Preview) is available only in English for players with accounts for PlayStation Network in the US and UK. </li>
<li>We've improved system software performance and stability. </li>
</ul>
<li>We've updated the device software of some DualSense wireless controllers to improve stability. </li>
<li>We've improved the messages and usability on some screens.</li>

<p>It is a great day to be an esports fan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially announced the creation of the Olympic Esports Games. Yes, this means video games will now be a part of the Olympics.</p>



<p>The news came earlier today (July 23, 2024) while being presented live by the IOC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-esports-have-officially-joined-the-olympics">Esports have Officially Joined the Olympics</h2>



<p>As the world of esports and gaming continues to grow, fans should expect to see massive feats, like today’s, in the future. With the IOC officially recognizing esports as an Olympic sport, the future of gaming looks to only be going upwards.</p>



<p>The 142 IOC Session voted today on whether or not esports should come to the Olympics. With zero voters voting <em>no</em> and zero <em>abstentions</em>, the entire committee voted <em>yes</em><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span>for video games to now be a part of the Olympic games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news arrives amidst the Esports World Cup 2024 being held in Saudi Arabia. While many are excited about this historic moment, it is important to remember that not just <em>any </em>game will be recognized in the Olympics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ioc-sets-rules-for-esports-in-the-olympics-excluding-first-person-shooters">IOC Sets Rules for Esports in the Olympics, Excluding First-person Shooters</h2>



<p>While esports joining the Olympic Games is a historic feat, there are still a few exceptions regarding different games. First off, not just every big esports game will be included. In fact, there will be zero first-person shooter games.</p>



<p>Games such as Valorant, Counter-Strike and Call of Duty will be excluded. This also has led people to wonder whether or not third-person shooters, such as Fortnite, will be included.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Last year, the Olympics hosted an esports tournament that featured Fortnite Creative, leading many to wonder what the Battle Royale’s role will be moving forward (if it has one).</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of games that will be involved in the Olympic Esports Games:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Street Fighter</li>



<li>Tekken</li>



<li>iRacing</li>



<li>NBA2K</li>



<li>FIFA</li>
</ul>



<p>There will also be various mobile games included, but none specified. As the years go by, though, more and more games could be added.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nobody Wants to Die Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-wants-to-die-review.935214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nobody Wants to Die starts at a drive-thru theater, our protagonist James taking in a black and white movie with his wife Rachel. You spend this peaceful moment joking around with her through conversation options amidst the pouring rain, but that respite is quickly destroyed. Rachel vanishes and the scene zooms out to reveal the dark, 24th century hellscape where James lives. It’s a great setup, showcasing everything you need to know about this moody cyberpunk detective noir. The world might be familiar, but the developers at Critical Hit Games have managed to fill it with fun details and a few moments that flip your expectations. Unfortunately, that strong start doesn’t <em>quite</em> hold up throughout Nobody Wants to Die’s roughly six-hour runtime; there’s a bit too much hand-holding during its investigation scenes, and it’s missing important features that would make its branching story structure easier to explore. But what it might lack in polish it makes up for in style. </p><p>Nobody Wants to Die is a story you’ve probably seen before: James is a detective with a tragic past he doesn’t remember, and who drowns himself in booze to dull the pain in a city full of flying cars, giant holographic ads, and buildings so tall you can’t see the ground. When he’s pulled into a case that ends up being bigger than he could’ve ever imagined, both his will and his skills as a detective are put to the test as he gets caught in a conspiratorial plot. On paper, it looks pretty basic; maybe even outright boring. And there are moments where it does stick to that script a bit too much.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nobody Wants to Die Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But this isn’t just any detective story; it’s a cyberpunk neo-noir that isn’t shy about its artistic and narrative influences. There’s a lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/altered-carbon-season-1-review">Altered Carbon</a> in its premise, specifically in how people can swap bodies after death (or just whenever they want). The sleek, jaw-dropping aesthetic is very reminiscent of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/29/blade-runner-2049-review">Blade Runner</a>, but with a 1950s Dark City pastiche instead of a Japanese one. It’s also not hard to see some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a> here, both in its basic cyberpunk elements and in how you can reconstruct crime scenes with gadgets that run on technobabble. Of course, there’s also the early 20th century detective noir of it all — complete with femme fatales, constant rain, lots of alcohol, and monologues from James that straddle the line between perfectly melodramatic and a bit too over the top. It’s true greasy, wet pulp.</p><p>Critical Hit Games wears an “eat the rich” attitude on its sleeve. The body swapping system seemingly allows for immortality, but you have to purchase a subscription when you come of age. If you can’t afford it, you’ll get arrested, with your brain put into “bank” storage; if you’re rich, you can just buy new bodies and switch out whenever you want. Sadly, the class warfare this concept enticingly establishes is mostly just used to move the plot along. It’s more an opportunity to call the rich “assholes” rather than make a more complex point about that inequality and why it exists.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Odd aesthetic details are all in service of the compelling atmosphere.</p></div><p>Despite taking a lot of its elements from other places, the developers have added a lot of their own unique details. We’ve seen body swapping in cyberpunk fiction before, but I don’t think I’ve seen a system that outright says how many disadvantages that can have if you get a body that was addicted to drugs or has allergies. I also love how James’ apartment building is such a shithole that he has to summon a shared bathroom to use, which leads to a hilarious interaction with a neighbor who was still bathing. </p><p>There are also tiny aesthetic details that don’t make much sense, like how many locks require you to input a numbered code with a rotary dial. Why is a world in the 24th century not utilizing computers more? How is James able to find a drive-in theater that plays nearly 400-year-old black and white movies? These odd tidbits are all in service of the compelling atmosphere, and it’s super easy to accept them when you can tell the Critical Hit Games is having a lot of fun just putting anachronisms together in new ways.</p><p>The setting and world-building pieces pay homage to the 1950s and film noir, but that doesn’t mean it’s held on a pedestal. Many of James’ monologues and musings about the grimy lives of others, the oppressive system they all live under, and the violence he has to face are overtly poetic and corny, and sometimes he or other characters — especially his partner, Sara — call him out on it. Sara is a great foil for James; they have compelling platonic chemistry, with her talking him through the case and his thoughts through a receiver in his ear, and he does the same for her. </p><p>With multiple dialogue paths to choose from in most conversations, you can either take a serious route during your investigation or go for the stupid answer – that could be listening to your corrupt police chief boss or ignoring him and stealing evidence. I played my first run straight, and while not every choice was “morally” correct, the darker tone felt genuine to James. I leaned into the silly options on my second playthrough and it created hilarious moments, like how James is afraid of the light from his UV detection tool because they cause cancer. He’s the kind of guy who sits on neon signs outside his apartment on the 500th story of a building, drinking or smoking (do not play this game if you’re afraid of heights) as a melodramatic loner, and Nobody Wants to Die takes every opportunity to make fun of him for that.</p><p>This combination of new and old creates a pulpy mix of scenes that can swing wildly between depressive retrospection, outright tragedy, and self-aware nonsense, and it all somehow never feels out of place. In fact, Nobody Wants to Die’s dedication to that tonal dissonance is largely what lets it stand out despite its very obvious homages.</p><h2>Nobody Wants to Hold Your Hand</h2><p>While Nobody Wants to Die wants you to play out a neo-noir detective fantasy, there are some limits — namely in how it lets you solve cases, which isn’t much at all. Most of the actions you’ll take outside of the branching dialogue boil down to the detective work itself, which involves surveying a crime scene, gathering evidence, using futuristic tech to reconstruct gruesome, gory murders so they play out in front of your eyes, and then putting it all together with an evidence board. </p><p>How all the gadgets work is a bit confusing at first, but by the end of the first case, you fall into a routine. Use the Reconstructor to reconstruct events, fast forward or rewind through the three-dimensional footage to find new evidence or leads you want to pursue, analyze those pieces, and pull out your supplementary UV light and X-Ray to dig a little deeper. All of the data you gather will then be presented on the evidence board, where you can draw conclusions through a little activity where you’ll similarly be told outright if you’re guessing right or wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It seems simple enough, and it is, especially because there are very few instances where you go about it on your own. You’ll usually get a prompt or a piece of dialogue that tells you exactly what to do, which tool to use, and how to think. You’re very much dragged through the story and forced to watch it play out instead of doing your own detective work, which removes any sense of accomplishment. There isn’t a time limit, nor is there fear you’ll miss an important clue. It can also be annoying when the figures moving throughout your reconstructions get in the way of your tools, blocking your view and causing you to make frivolous mistakes as you complete a series of mouse clicks to activate them. </p><p>The choice to remove all your agency during these investigation phases does at least allow you to experience the story more closely, since you don’t have to focus on other areas, like actually solving a case yourself. That’s especially true in how certain events impact each other to create more conversation options, but the rigid structure does also lessen the impact of your investigation quite a bit. </p><p>Thankfully, the dialogue system is worth paying attention to. It’s not the most robust I’ve seen, but there’s enough choice that you feel like you have a semblance of control over James and his actions while talking. His core personality never changes, but you can decide whether he answers Sara honestly about evidence he chose to steal from a crime scene, drink and drive, comply with the police, or even shoot somebody. How impactful your choices are varies, and there are multiple endings despite the story always arriving at the same tense confrontation, but Nobody Wants to Die understands that it’s about the journey. The final payoff is also satisfyingly dark, letting you ruminate on your choices – sometimes to the point of absolute despair. </p><h2>Nobody Wants You to Save Your Game</h2><p>If you’re invested enough to see all the different outcomes, you can start again on a new save file, but Critical Hit Games didn’t make it easy to run through a second time. While not giving you the option to manually save is a great way to make you sit and think about the consequence of each choice, it does make it quite difficult to see everything. There isn’t any new game plus or chapter select after your first playthrough, either. If you want to fast forward through long conversations, you only have the option to spam a skip button, which you have to click for each line of dialogue, and you can’t skip cutscenes at all. So if you want to experience the different endings, you’ll pretty much just have to play through the entire campaign again.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Best choice-driven narrative games</h3><p>Like the ability to make choices in how your character interacts with the game world? These games can help with that.</p></div><p>Granted, Nobody Wants to Die is only five or six hours long, and depending on the ending you get, there’s plenty of motivation to hop back in. I got a particularly bad ending that, to me, felt like the worst possible outcome for the story, so I of course wanted to see if I could get <em>anything</em> else — maybe something that didn’t make me feel dead inside (pun intended). Starting from scratch wasn’t a total slog, since I made new choices that unlocked conversations or paid off differently down the line. Still, I eventually looked up a compilation of all the endings, and while there are certainly happier ones than the initial one I got, none of them are “perfect.” James’ story is about a past that slowly emerges to haunt him, and your player skills aren’t going to stop his bittersweet conclusion. </p><p>The decision to not include these replayability features is an interesting one, as many branching narrative games want you to feel the weight of your choices but also give you the opportunity to change them. I have to give the developers credit on making such an audacious move, but does it make Nobody Wants to Die more “enjoyable,” whatever that vague term means? I’m not sure. Maybe I would feel differently if I got the “best” ending on my first try, but it feels like there should be an option to help speed up additional playthroughs after the first at the very least. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today Humble Games, publisher of indie hits like <em>Signalis</em>, <em>Wizard of Legend</em>, and <em>Temtem</em>, informed employees of layoffs that will impact the whole company, leaving its staff of 36 jobless.</p><p>Laid-off workers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to LinkedIn</a> to relay what management told them in a morning meeting, which Aftermath has obtained a recording of. In the meeting, Steve Horowitz, president of parent company Ziff Davis’ technology and shopping division, pointed to long delays and rising costs as pervasive issues faced by Humble Games. He went on to say that Ziff had attempted to sell Humble Games twice, but that “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome."&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he explained, employees are being let go, and remaining projects will be carried over the finish line by a third-party company called The Powell Group.&nbsp;</p><p>"We continue to see the cost rise, delays continue, and during the sale process or our attempt to sell over the past couple of months, we've seen an additional millions increase in development expenses coupled with even longer delays in bringing titles to market,” Horowitz told employees. “Given all this, we've made a very tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games with the goal of providing the best cost-effective way to make sure that the games see the market, our existing slate sees market, and supporting the developers that are associated with it. As such, we're gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog. As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesperson for Humble Games told Aftermath that this is a restructuring, not a closure, mirroring <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humble Games’ statement on the matter on Twitter</a>. However, considering that all employees are being laid off and a third-party company is taking over their duties, what remains will be Humble Games in name only.&nbsp;</p><p>Former employees are incensed by what they perceive to be damage control tactics on Ziff Davis’ part.</p><p>"Ziff is trying to spread the idea that it's a restructuring to save face, but that's a lie," one former Humble Games employee, who was granted anonymity to avoid potentially voiding a severance agreement, told Aftermath. "No one from HG survived the layoffs, nor will they have anything to do with game launches moving forward."</p><p>Chris Radley, a former Humble Games creative lead who left the company at the end of 2022, spelled things out even more clearly <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>"Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left," Radley wrote. "Do not believe this tailored message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was once again a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative, and it's so disrespectful."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Humble Games was a publisher spun off from Humble Bundle, a charity-centric storefront that was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bundle-has-been-acquired-by-media-giant-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by IGN in 2017</a> and which has not been impacted by today’s cuts. More recently, IGN purchased the Gamer Network of sites – which includes Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, GamesIndustry.biz, and VG247 – for an undisclosed sum, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate layoffs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dicebreaker-layoffs-board-games-website-ign-gamer-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gutting of Dicebreaker</a>, a beloved board game site. Former Humble Games employees to whom Aftermath spoke believe that these cuts are less tied up in that side of the business and more the end result of a media company failing to understand how to run a video game publisher.</p><p>"The business models were just incompatible with each other,” a former Humble Games employee told Aftermath. “Ziff is very good at owning a lot of media and increasing revenue in advertising, and Humble Games publishing was just not something that agreed with their business model. They needed money. They needed it now. They wanted to see an immediate increase in revenue after investing cash into a business, and unfortunately that's just not how games works."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another former Humble Games employee told Aftermath: “Ziff Davis does not understand the world of game development – and the principle that when you invest money, a game is not released in six months but takes time to be done – and were starting to not like this when they understood its workings, so with their stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development.”</p><p>Former employees were surprised by Ziff’s decision to lay everybody off, with some hoping today’s meeting would instead be about a sale. That said, there were signs that trouble was afoot: Late last year, Humble Games was <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/humble-games-layoffs-november-2023?utm_source=reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit with layoffs</a>, and former employees say that this year saw the company fail to sign any projects for 2026 or 2027, a conspicuous gap in the calendar considering the kind of lead time game releases require.</p><p>Former employees are feeling crushed by this latest turn of events, a painfully jarring conclusion to a project they took immense pride in despite the ups and downs.</p><p>"We were very charity-oriented. Humble Bundle itself raised a quarter of a billion dollars for charity, and I know a portion of that was due to Humble Games,” said one former employee. "We looked for people who didn't just want to be in games, who didn't just want to be in some random indie games publisher, but people that very much exemplified those values.”</p><p>“Everyone cared for each other, taking on work of their colleagues to help when needed, always taking into consideration what could hurt or impact their colleagues and trying to ease it before it even happened,” said another former employee. “And this was reflected back to the way we worked with the indie devs, providing honest feedback without imposing creative changes, respecting and trusting in their game visions, not going by the letter of the contract when it came to [approving] milestones, as everyone knows how game devs work and how sometimes things takes a bit longer before becoming good. … This was truly a unique publisher with an amazing cast of people, and I am not sure that a similar publishing structure exists.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has formally revoked the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> World Championship 2024 winning team's title after racist messages sent by several of its members surfaced online.
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was held in April, with six teams competing for the crown. North American team Jackpot was eventually named the winner, but the four-person group became embroiled in controversy this June, after Discord and social media chats showing some of its members engaging in racist behaviour began <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800558539934773269">circulating on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, roughly six weeks later, Nintendo has officially rescinded Jackpot's winning title, albeit without explicitly specifying the reason behind its decision.

<p>
"It has come to our attention," the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887">wrote on social media</a>, "that certain members of team Jackpot, the team that recently won the Splatoon 3 World Championship, acted in a manner that is not in line with our Community Guidelines while playing the Splatoon 3 game. As a result, team Jackpot's win will be considered vacated, and the team will not receive trophies associated with the event."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo additionally notes the Splashtag banner currently commemorating Jackpot's win in Splatoon 3 will be "adjusted" in a future update. "Nintendo cares deeply about our player and our community," it adds, "and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously."
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">event was cancelled</a> to "ensure the safety of our customers" after Nintendo received a message threatening to "kill the people at the venue".
</p>
<p>
In April, a 27-year-old man was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">charged</a> with sending the message - one of 39 death threats he's said to have sent to Nintendo via the company's online inquiry form.

According to <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1815817188286009617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon's Nicole Carpenter</a>, the layoffs affect 36 workers. <em>[Disclosure: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis. Charity bundle platform Humble Bundle remains a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment.]</em></p><p>The announcement was part of a statement from Humble Games, which was published on Linkedin in the wake of <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several workers confirming their layoffs on social media</a>. The statement emphasized "the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects" while saying that the restructuring does not impact Humble Bundle.</p><blockquote>In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p><p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reached separately for comment, a Ziff Davis representative shared the statement posted above and said that the company is "not shutting down but is undergoing restructuring," and that "all past and ongoing projects and upcoming releases are not affected and will continue to be supported and published by Humble Games." The representative said they could not comment on the number of staff affected or remaining. <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aftermath</a> has since reported that all employees have been laid off and that work will be completed by a third-party company.</p><p>Humble Games is an indie publishing label with a portfolio including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus, Signalis and Stray Gods. Several developers who worked with Humble Games expressed sympathy in the wake of the layoffs.</p><p>"My sincerest best wishes to all the former Humble Games staff, several of whom helped make [Unsighted] what it was," <a href="https://x.com/ironfairy42/status/1815835839668314429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote Unsighted developer Fernanda Dias</a>. "Thank you so much for working so hard on so many amazing games. This is incredibly heartbreaking news holy sh*t."</p><p>Humble Games is one of several indie publishers that has been forced to restructure amid uncertainty in the games industry throughout 2024. IGN reported in May that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">Take-Two was quietly winding down its Private Division label</a> in the wake of shuttering OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">Xbox, PlayStation, EA, and numerous other publishers have also suffered layoffs</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

It was later discovered that Crowdstrike, a large cybersecurity company, had pushed out an update that was borked and broke everything for hours. And as is common on the internet these days, people began joking about it and making up stories, some of which went viral. For example, a lot of people still think the Las Vegas Sphere crashed during the Crowdstrike event.

Sure, the software they are using to plan flights and manage their employees looks old and has apparently been around since 2007 or so. That’s true, and scary. But no, Southwest didn’t avoid the Windows Crash because they use an operating system from 1992. As for why Southwest mostly avoided the chaos of July 19?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-withdraws-splatoon-3-world-championship-after-racist-messages-from-winners-surface<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In April, USA's team Jackpot won Nintendo's Splatoon 3 World Championship, earning an in-game appearance that cemented its members as the first players to be commemorated in a Splatoon game. However, after racist messages sent by the team surfaced in the months following the event, Nintendo has now announced that it will invalidate the team's win and remove their likenesses from the game.</p><p>Today, in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, Nintendo Versus announced that Jackpot's win would be vacated and the team would not receive trophies due to its violations of the company's community guidelines.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update on the 2024 Splatoon 3 World Championship: <a href="https://t.co/pYUMQzmj7S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pYUMQzmj7S</a></p>— Nintendo Versus (@NintendoVS) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Nintendo also pledged to adjust a Splashtag (or in-game profile banner) it had added to the game to commemorate Jackpot's win. The adjustment will presumably remove the team's characters from the banner and replace them with default characters.</p><p>Phantom Thief of the Heart, the Japanese team that played against Jackpot in the final, was not retroactively granted the win after the announcement, leaving the World Championship with no official winner. </p><p>"Nintendo cares deeply about our players and our community, and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously," the post reads.</p><p>Nintendo's move comes after the team's racist messages circulated online in early June. Videos and screenshots (which can be seen in <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800557391404265812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this thread</a> — warning for offensive language) show members of the team using racist slurs and phrases in Discord messages and calls, with some even sending targeted messages to other players.</p><p><em>Amelia Zollner is a freelance writer at IGN who loves all things indie and Nintendo.
