The device, which costs $200, works like a charm and is quietly one of the best things Sony has made in some time. However, the Portal’s one big flaw was that, for some reason, it couldn’t stream games from the cloud. You had to own a PS5 and, when using the Portal, your PS5 would turn on and play your game remotely. It meant that the PS Portal was more an accessory than a console. But that changes today. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 19, PlayStation released the latest update</a></span> for the PS Portal and while it adds some nice quality-of-life upgrades regarding sound settings, the real news is that starting today, players can play a selection of PS5 games via the cloud and without a console. In theory, you can now play PS5 games while out and about, assuming you have a wifi connection. </p><p>Sony says that over 120 PS5 games included in the PS Plus Game Catalog can be streamed on PS Portal after today’s update. The games include <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, Ghost of Tsushima, </em>and <em>Dave the Diver.</em></p><h2 id="h13476"><a id=""></a> How to stream cloud games on your PS Portal</h2><p>To start streaming PS5 games on your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852">PS Portal</a></span> without a console, you’ll need an active PS Plus Premium subscription, and then you’ll have to download the update and follow these steps:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li><li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li><li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li></ol></blockquote><p>At the moment, Sony is calling this a beta test, and not all features, like the capture button and party chat, will be supported in these streaming games on Portal. Likewise, Sony doesn’t currently support PS2, PS3, or PS4 games or purchased PSN games. </p><p>Hopefully, after testing and more updates, Sony will expand support and turn the PS Portal into a badass PlayStation streaming device capable of playing all those classic games added to the catalog each month as well as games you own.

Everybody brings their own special personal connection to the game.”</p><p>One of the big questions was why the<em> Minecraft </em>movie is live-action with tons of VFX instead of just being completely CGI-animated as fans may have expected a movie based on the hit survival crafting game to be. A fan-made trailer that was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the official one, only in <em>Minecraft</em> itself, seemed designed to provoke this question and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went viral</a></span>. </p><p> “I mean, that was one of the things [fans were saying in response to the trailer]: ‘Why is it live action? Why isn’t it animated?’ I think a lot of people were expecting that, and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets didn’t feel right with them, because in their imagination, they’ve been playing it for a very long time,” Olafsson told <em>IGN</em>. “And they’ve kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that’s been made both by us, the community, we’ve made a story mode. We made animated content before, and there’s a lot of it out there.”</p><p> Olafsson explained that one of the reasons to do a live-action adaptation was precisely because it was different and hadn’t already been done before. It was also something that had been put in motion long ago. Warner Bros. began working with <em>Minecraft</em> maker Mojang to produce a movie as far back as 2014, and the current version set to release in 2025 is the result of a long and messy process, with the project changing creative hands several times. </p><p> “This movie’s been in development for a very, very long time,” Olafsson said. “A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had, and there was always going to be live action.” </p><p>According to Hess, there were also a lot of things, like Momoa using the crafting table, that just didn’t come across right in the rapidly edited context of the initial trailer. The duo seem confident that the way those gameplay elements are communicated and fleshed out in the movie itself will make a lot more sense to long-time fans. </p><p>Apparently, early test audiences agree. The pair say early screenings of the <em>Minecraft </em>movie, even without completed VFX, have garnered positive feedback, unlike that first trailer. “People are like, ‘This is nothing like the trailer. This movie is awesome,’” Olafsson said. The movie is set to release on April 4 of next year. A second trailer, released today, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319">looks a lot better</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-kadokawa-fromsoftware-elden-ring-crunchyroll<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Word on the street</a> is that Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, which you might know as the main shareholder of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> studio FromSoftware, but which also owns other video game companies like Spike Chunsoft, Acquire, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and FromNetworks, a substantial chunk of the manga industry, a publishing arm that is responsible for many of Japan’s still-remaining gaming magazines (including Famitsu), and anime studios like Doga Kobo ENGI, Studio KADAN, and Raging Bull. The list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Corporation#Group_companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes on</a>. Hoovering up the Japanese mega-conglomerate is definitely an idea, but here’s another: Don’t!&nbsp;</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions haven’t been so great for the people who make games in recent times – both in the increasingly un-hallowed halls of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s rivals</a> and specifically at Sony. This year alone, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-laying-off-900-people-8-of-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 900 people</a> – or eight percent of its workforce – across beloved, successful studios like Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla. Bungie, a relatively recent addition to Sony’s portfolio, was also <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to lay off</a> 220 people and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-carves-off-more-of-bungie-the-creative-studios-team-is-now-officially-a-part-of-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beam up into the Sony mothership</a> to churn out live service games. Most recently, Sony <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <em>Concord </em>developer Firewalk Studios</a>, another recent acquisition, after its costly debut game failed to gain immediate traction.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony’s reputation in the anime and manga space has also taken some recent hits. The Japanese giant owns Funimation, which acquired near-ubiquitous anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021, after which Funimation shut down its own streaming service, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065940/funimation-shutdown-crunchyroll-digital-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiping users’ digital libraries and subjecting them to significant price hikes</a>. Crunchyroll management has also recently come under fire for allegedly <a href="https://animesuperhero.com/voice-actor-david-wald-leaves-crunchyroll-over-companys-alleged-mail-tampering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tampering with a voice actor’s private mail</a>, causing the actor, David Wald, to drop his roles with the company. Other actors have accused Crunchyroll of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mob-psycho-100-crunchyroll-kyle-mccarley-sag-aftra-1849559684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-union behavior</a>.</p><p>What if we <em>didn’t </em>feed the aforementioned Kadokawa subsidiaries into the mashing maw of that infernal machine? What if, instead, we broke up both Sony and Kadokawa? Wouldn’t that be fun? More fun, perhaps, than even a sequel to <em>Bloodborne</em>? Alas, this deal will probably sail through without issue, but I can dream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More people are happy about that—people love those daggone <em>Equalizers</em>.”</p><p>Yes, we do love those daggone <em>Equalizer</em> films. That’s why each of the three films in the franchise has averaged a hefty $190 million at the box office. Typically, when actors of Washington’s esteemed pedigree do these wildly successful but artistically unchallenging films, it’s to fund projects they actually want to make. Do you think Robert Downey Jr. spent a decade inside a red fake robot suit in hopes of winning an Oscar? Washington subscribed to this same thinking, until he realized the impact of films like <em>The Equalizer</em>.</p><p>“I’ll sometimes say to myself, ‘One’s for me, one’s for them.’ So, for example, <em>Othello</em>: We’re doing it on Broadway and then a movie. That’s for me. But I’ve come to realize that the <em>Equalizer</em> films are for me, too, because they’re for the people,” he explains. “They want me to go get the bad guys. ‘We can’t get them, so you go get them.’ And I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there. I’ll be right back!’”</p><p>Is it irrational to have such an emotional attachment to a movie character that you yearn for them to fight bad guys who don’t exist? Sure, somewhat. Is that attachment the core reason why putting moving images on screens is a multi-million dollar business in America? Absolutely! And Denzel understands that.</p><p>This revelation from Washington all but ensures that he’ll be a leading man in an action film in his 70s. It’s not unheard of. Heck, Charles Bronson was 72 years old and still playing a similar vigilante in another long-standing action film franchise when he starred in <em>Death Wish V: The Face of Death</em>. Antoine Fuqua, director of every <em>Equalizer</em> film, even said in 2023 that he’s tossed around the idea of using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-aging technology</a></span> on Washington for an <em>Equalizer</em> origin story.</p><p>If these are possibly some of the final action films for Washington, who said he will scale back his output significantly, they should do anything and everything to make sure one of the greatest actors of all time goes out looking like a badass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don’t play bingo, so I didn’t have a bingo card available specifically for this situation (sorry!), but it appears Sony wants you to play more video games within its ecosystem, so the company’s pushing a new update for the PlayStation Portal today. The update includes cloud streaming, which is still in beta, with support for 120 PlayStation 5 titles available via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. Of course, you must subscribe to PS+ Premium to enjoy a cloud streaming performance of 1080p resolutions in 60 frames per second. Fancy!</p>



<p>That said, according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, several features are available during the beta, some that aren’t available, and a number of locations where you can check out the cloud streaming beta. We’ll start there:</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-cloud-streaming-beta">How to Join the Cloud Streaming Beta</h2>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is cleared for takeoff, ready to give aircraft fanciers and digital globetrotters another jaunt across its beautiful world. But in a turn of events almost exactly mirroring the launch day woes seen by its 2020 predecessor, Flight Simulator 2024 is struggling to gt off the ground, with players complaining of lengthy post-install download times, installation freezes, and more as Microsoft's servers buckle under the demand.
</p>
<p>
Already, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/">tarred with the Overwhelmingly Negative brush on Steam</a>, with players reporting a range of issues - all of which are eerily familiar to those seen back in 2020. Mostly, the finger is once again being pointed toward developer Asobo's insistence that players download the bulk of the game - equalling approximately 50GB - through the in-game interface, utilising Microsoft's servers instead of Steam's. That's traditionally been a languid pursuit at the best of times, but on launch day - when everyone is struggling to get in at once - it's proving even more glacial.
</p>
<p>
Some users are seeing their downloads stall at 97 percent, while others, having successfully cleared that first hurdle, then report being stuck in lengthy log-in queues. Additionally, Flight Simulator's reliance on streaming means plenty of people are having a miserable experience even if they do get in, with reported issues including sluggish world loading and even invisible planes. "I can only marvel at the depth of the simulation," wrote one Steam reviewer, "as it now feels like Boeing was actually involved in building the servers."

<p>
"I enjoyed the short movie about a man and a plane," added another frustrated user. "However, it seemed quite expensive for its length - around one minute. I would wait until the loading screen is on sale before purchase because it does get quite samey after the 70th loop." As for the Microsoft's Flight Simulator subreddit, it's currently awash in some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv54xo/status_update/">top</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv3nhh/server_loading_times/">class</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv5ekg/msfs_2024_will_use_cloud_streaming_the_cloud/">memes</a>.
</p><p>
Over on Flight Simulator's support page, Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714">acknowledged the issues</a> players are experiencing. "We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024," it wrote. "With so many users initialising the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
"For users whose initial load is past 90 percent and no longer progressing, we recommend a reboot," it added, immediately eliciting a collective scream from everyone without a high-speed internet connection. "Otherwise we advise waiting to allow the loading to proceed as normal." The Xbox support page, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1858954069924065751">acknowledged</a> "slow download and install times", suggesting players keep an eye on its <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status">live status page</a> while it investigates.
</p>
<p>
Some Steam customers have also expressed concern that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's lengthy in-game install solution means downloads are eating into the platform's two-hour refund window. Back in 2020, Valve moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-users-want-microsoft-flight-simulator-refund-time-extended">assure customers only actual play time would be counted</a>, but it's not yet confirmed the same applies in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Developer Asobo has, of course, been talking a big game for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ahead of launch, promising a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, crop dusting, skydive aviation, hot air balloon tours, and more. It's also teased "literally trillions of trees", even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">ability to get out your plane and walk a trail</a> - all of which sounds like it'll be marvellous, as long as Flight Simulator navigates its launch day turbulence on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, and sticks the landing.

The adorable DreamWorks fantasy adventure about Vikings and Pokémon-style pet dragons is being re-shot with actual humans this time around. Based on the first trailer, at least the reptilian star of the movie looks great. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,197298" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The movie is about a village chief’s young failson named Hiccup and how he redeems himself through quick wits and a budding but forbidden friendship with a black dragon named Toothless. Gerard Butler is reprising his role as Hiccup’s father but the rest of the cast is completely new, including Mason Thames (<em>The Black Phone</em>) as Hiccup and Nico Parker as fellow village kid Astrid. The remake’s first teaser shows Hiccup refusing to wage war on dragons as his father demands, and his pivotal first meeting with Toothless. </p><p>Toothless, the main draw of the movie, looks excellent. Imagine taking the creature from the original 2010 movie and giving him an Unreal Engine 5 makeover, just without all the uncanny valley stuff. The rest of the movie looks less spectacular, with dense fog and heavy special effects begging the question of why, exactly, you should make a live-action version of a cartoon about epic battles and fantastical creatures in a mythical land untouched by time. </p><p>Profit motive, for one, and a creatively bankrupt Hollywood for another. Even Butler basically just looks like someone cosplaying the CGI version of the character instead of giving audiences something genuinely new and different. Maybe as we get closer to the remake’s release, what Universal shows will get more convincing. At the very least, kids will love another reason to watch Toothless be cute and ferocious in equal measures all over again. </p><p>The live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> is out on June 13, 2025. In the meantime, the original version—an all-time classic—is streaming on Max, Hulu, and other platforms. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> is coming next year. Publisher The Game Kitchen and tabletop developer Ludus Magnus Studio have announced a tabletop adaptation of the dark fantasy indie action game will be coming through a crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound.</p>



<p>According to the Gamefound <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/lms/blasphemous-the-boardgame#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> is a competitive tabletop experience based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blasphemous-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a> videogame.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=k29tMlsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=kv-0IUw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in the dark fantasy world of Cvstodia. It is a dark, gothic world inhabited by highly religious followers of a devout order. An order that believes that all diseases, afflictions, and supernatural events are the cause of something called the Miracle and that acts of extreme penance, pain, and sacrifice can lead to salvation from its influence.</p>

<p>It is a setting highly influenced by The Game Kitchen's home region of Seville, themes of Catholic guilt, and the methods of torture inflicted by The Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>In <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em>, 1-4 players take on the role of zealous warriors known as Penitents. Players will explore the land of Cvstodia, fight enemies, and complete quests, all in preparation to face down deadly bosses.</p>

<p>While the game is competitive in nature, players will need to work together to take down these terrifying foes. Each boss has a unique victory condition, which can be achieved through different strategies, adding potential replay value to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-phalaris-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=coWv5vbd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blasphemous-the-board-game-phalaris-miniature-artwork.jpg?itok=wJQOSkbc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like an RPG, players can choose different kinds of Penitents to start and slowly customize them into unique builds. Penitents of Abdon are straightforward bruisers, Penitents of Crimson Dusk are cunning and swift strikes. As you complete quests, you will gain custom dice, prayers, and beads that will improve your abilities.</p>

<p>Those quests are presented in narrative booklets. Each quest in the game contains up to four booklets: one general booklet and 3 specific ones.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will contain miniatures based on enemies from the videogames. The preview page confirms the Esquilon, Flagellant, Shieldmaiden, and Phalaris are in the game with more to be announced.</p>

<p>The Gamefound campaign for <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will go live in Q1 2025. If you follow the campaign beforehand, you will get an exclusive Penitent One miniature with your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

If you hired her, she could help out during matches by throwing ice grenades at enemies, but she would often spam them, annoying and hindering even the players she was supposed to be assisting. So Epic has now stepped in and taken away the digital rapper’s ice bombs.

Eminem and Snoop Dogg were previously added this month and like Ice Spice, if you found them on the island during a match and defeated them in combat, you could hire them to be your bodyguard/co-op buddy. However, players quickly discovered that Ice Spice loves spamming her chiller grenades—which explode and encase your feet in blocks of ice—the moment an enemy player is nearby, leading to a lot of frustration. </p><p>You can find clips online of the digital rapper freezing people who she is, in theory, supposed to be helping. </p><p>When her ice bombs hit, they freeze your feet and greatly increase your speed, but make it harder to control your direction. Sometimes this is useful, like when you are chasing someone down or trying to escape.</p><p>But other times, when you are trying to hide or stay elevated on a ledge during a fight, it’s very unhelpful. Ice Spice didn’t give a shit, however, and would toss ice bombs with reckless abandon as seen in the clips above. This has led to players not hiring her, and complaining online about all the ice bomb spam. </p><p>On November 18, after a few days of Ice Spice trolling people with dozens of chiller grenades, Epic announced that it was stepping in and taking away her icy explosives.</p><p>“Time to defrost! Due to a gameplay issue affecting Ice Spice’s Chiller Grenade usage, we have disabled them while we work on a fix,” posted Epic Games on Twitter. </p><p>So it’s now safe to recruit Ice Spice in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-peely-leatherface-skins-halloween-leaks-1851680623&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-peely-leatherface-skins-halloween-leaks-1851680623"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>.

<p>Like many, I gave Warhammer 40,000: Darktide a fair shake. I spent nearly 100 hours leveling multiple classes, completing every mission, and checking out the most recent updates. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game recently, and it appears the experience will improve vastly in December. The launch of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Grim Protols offers a new game mode, missions, weapons, and limited-time events across all systems.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-features-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide-the-grim-protocols">New Features in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide The Grim Protocols</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the brand-new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide features a new game mode, mission, weapon families, limited-time events, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and more. There’s even a fantastic narrative trailer to help get you in the mood for its launch!</p>

<li><strong>New Mission – Dark Communion:</strong>&nbsp;Return to the Carnival and explore its darkest corners. Steel yourself as you face hordes of cultists who will stop at nothing to achieve their dark communion.</li>



<li><strong>Three New Weapon Families:&nbsp;</strong>tear through waves of enemies by wielding the destructive might of the Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, and the Ogryn Heavy Stubber.</li>



<li><strong>Anniversary Special Event:</strong>&nbsp;to celebrate the second anniversary of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the game will host an event that will reward players with a unique weapon trinket.</li>



<li><strong>And more:</strong>&nbsp;including the expansion of the Penance progression track with new challenges and rewards, as well as quality of life improvements such as an extension of the Party Finder feature.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-darktide-update-come-out">When Does the Next Darktide Update Come Out?</h2>



<p>Darktide Grim Protocols launches alongside the PlayStation 5 release on December 3. The first-person horde shooter is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and it’s an enjoyable time if you don’t mind paying $40 for admission. It does go on sale frequently, though, especially with the upcoming holiday sales Steam intends to run for Fall and Winter, so keep an eye out for a deal!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24235698/minecraft-movie-trailer"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> has a new trailer giving us a taste at the kind of story moviegoers can expect. The trailer predominately features Jack Black as Steve, the silent protagonist players embody in <em>Minecraft</em>. In the trailer, Black’s Steve is way more chatty, giving us his backstory as a child who quite literally yearns for the mines. As an adult, Steve finds a special blue cube that transports him to the <em>Minecraft</em> world where, “anything you can imagine is possible.” </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the movie, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> before it, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a>. A group of unsuspecting folks including Danielle Brooks, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen are magically transported to the world to find a blocky paradise of Steve’s making. The trailer features another look at the movie versions of popular <em>Minecraft </em>devices like redstone-powered minecarts, crafting tables, and ender pearls. There’s even a reference to the crazy contraptions players can create in the game with an automatic chicken cooker that uses lava as a heating element.</p><p>In conjunction with the trailer’s release, Xbox has published a blog that goes into detail about all the devices seen in the trailer. Check it out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/19/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-game-features/">here</a>. And you can watch Jack Black and Jason Momoa chew the scenery when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next iteration of Valve’s Steam Controller appears set to enter mass production. According to a <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new claim from Valve insider</a> Brad Lynch, Steam Controller 2, codenamed “Ibex” is in deep development.</p>



<p>According to Lynch, Steam Controller 2 is “being tooled for a mass production” in factories and is in a “later [stage] of productization”.</p>



<p>In addition to the production news, Lynch says that the new controller from Valve will have symmetrical sticks and that it’s “not far off from Steam Deck input”.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Aside from from the Steam Controller 2, Lynch touched on a controller codenamed “Roy” for Valve’s “Deckard” VR headset. Not only is that device also heading for mass production, but he says that it will have a directional pad, bumpers, grip buttons, triggers, ABXY buttons, and a system button. That’s lead to speculation that it will be able to work as a stand alone controller away from “Deckard”.</p>



<p>Lynch didn’t give a timeline on when players could expect to see or hear something official about either the Steam Controller 2, “Deckard”, or “Roy”.</p>



<p>Valve also hasn’t commented on the latest rumors or confirmed the existence of any of the devices.  </p>

They're pretty solid, and it sounds like a possible weekly feature.</p><ul><li>Rose - Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Explosive Payload, Smooth Grip, Handling MW</li><li>Multimach - Polygonal Rifling + Tactical Mag + Attrition Orbs + Kinetic Tremors + Reload MW</li><li>Indebted Kindness - Smart Drift Control + Tactical Mag + Loose Change + Voltshot + Velocity MW</li><li>Compass Rose - Corkscrew Rifling, Light Mag, Snapshot Sights, Slideshot, Handling MW</li><li>Hothead (Adept) - Hard Launch + Impact Casing + Tracking Module + Clown Cartridge + Reload MW</li><li>VS Chill Inhibitor - Countermass + Spike Grenades + Envious Arsenal + Bait and Switch + Reload MW</li></ul><p>"Starting Today, Banshee-44 has a small collection of weapons in the Tower with curated perk rolls.

<p>The PlayStation 5 is four years old, and that means its time for rumors for the next-generation PlayStation 6 (PS6) to pick up more steam. According to a new rumor on a Chinese forum from <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2652187-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known hardware leaker zhangzhonghao</a>, the PS6 will use AMD’s next-gen UDNA GPU architecture within the console.</p>



<p>It’s the same architecture AMD will use in its Radeon 9000 series GPUs starting in 2026. It was also reaffirmed that the console itself will utilize either a Zen4 or Zen5 CPU. The CPU decision, however, remains undecided, per the claim.</p>



<p>Rumors of the PS6 using AMD is nothing new. It was reported in September that the system would stick with AMD over Intel in order to preserve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features such as backward compatibility</a>. Lastly, it was said that Sony’s PlayStation handheld, will also use AMD hardware. </p>

<p>It’s important to keep in mind that none of this has been confirmed by Sony in any capacity as its far too early for the company to begin publicly commenting on its next system. Insider Gaming has also yet to independently verify the legitimacy of the rumor, so, please, take the information with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As far as when to expect to see the PS6, the latest documents Insider Gaming has seen show a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back and forth on a potential release</a> year, though 2028 looks likely. There are also claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-2-socs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has two SoCs</a> (Systems on a chip) in development for the next-gen console.</p>

                <p>Starfield has crossed a new player milestone, reaching 15 million players, as developer Bethesda Game Studios also released a new update that includes the next land vehicle, a new quest, fixes, and more.</p><p>Starfield reached 6 million players on launch day--September 7, 2023--becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-already-has-over-6-million-players-making-it-bethesdas-biggest-launch-of-all-time/1100-6517567/" data-ref-id="1100-6517567">biggest launch in Bethesda's history</a>, and a launch no doubt fueled by Game Pass.

However, achievements will not retroactively unlock.</p><p>Additionally, the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, is available now for everyone.

This is a new quest where players meet a person, Harbhajan, who is a gifted mechanic with a passion for cooking. "When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan--a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life," Bethesda said. "Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?"</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.

            <p>
A new report detailing the drama behind the three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors all simultaneously announced last month has outlined a convoluted web of connections, fallouts, and legal action, suggesting the beloved RPG's legacy remains as messy as ever. 
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium's original developer ZA/UM was, of course, at legal loggerheads with various former team members for quite some time; but while ZA/UM has said those lawsuits are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">now resolved</a>, it seems drama has continued to swirl around those involved, even as they move onto other ventures. Those ventures include new projects at Dark Math Games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">Longdue</a>, two UK-based studios comprised of former Disco Elysium developers, who both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors back in October. It also leads us to Argo Tuulik - one of the original writers on Disco Elysium and a key creative on ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-standalone-disco-elysium-spin-off-would-have-been-most-hardcore-disco-since-disco">cancelled Disco Elysium spin-off X7</a> - who followed up those announcements by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">revealing he'd also co-founded a new studio</a>, Summer Eternal, with former ZA/UM developer Dora Klindžić.
</p>
<p>
And now a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">report by IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole</a> has delved deeper into the tangle of the three new studios, laying out the financial links between the two UK-based teams (Longdue founder Riaz Moola is also an investor in Dark Math Games), and revealing Tuulik and Klindžić both previously worked at Dark Math - as director and narrative director on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">recently announced XXX Nightshift</a> - <em>and</em> later at Longdue. It's fascinatingly convoluted stuff.

<figcaption>Dark Math Games' XXX Nightshift was unveiled in October.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
IGN reports Tuulik and Klindžić both departed Dark Math this July after the company elected not to renew Tuulik's contract due to "creative differences". Tensions are said to have come to a head after Tuulik claimed Dark Math boss Kaur Kender (who was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-legal-battle-reaches-court-centres-on-alleged-48m-fraud">also previously embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with ZA/UM</a> over the ownership fo the Diso Elysium IP) had shown him - and other staff members - naked photos of his ex-wife. Speaking to IGN, Kender disputed the claim, saying the woman - who was to serve as inspiration for characters in XXX Nightshift - was wearing a bikini in some photos, and was fully clothed in others. Dark Math, meanwhile, told IGN it would "not be commenting on the past".
</p><p>
And it only gets more fractious from there. Tuulik and Klindžić are then said to have moved over to Longdue via parent company CoGrammar, with Tuulik working as a consultant on the studio's still unnamed "psychological RPG". However, the two later resigned, leaving at the end of September, ultimately leading to legal action that saw CoGrammar successfully obtain an injection in England and Wales on the basis of breach of contact - preventing the pair from working on anything at their new studio Summer Eternal until April 2025.
</p>
<p>
Tuulik called the verdict an "absurdity" in a message sent to IGN, while a statement shared by CoGrammar claimed that prior to its legal action, the company had offered to release Tuulik and Klindžić from contractual restrictions - blocking them from working with other studios within six months after their departure - but the duo declined to sign the release contracts.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not the end of it. Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, in the midst of all this, is said to have filed a legal notice against Tuulik, alleging breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and copyright infringement - all related to a USB stick containing a playable, 20-minute build of Disco Elysium follow-up X7 that Tuulik is said to have shown Longdue and Dark Math employees. But it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">worth reading IGN's full report</a> for the details on that particular thread.
</p>
<p>
It is, in other words, all a bit of a mess. And that's without factoring in what Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - who were both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct</a> - will do next.
