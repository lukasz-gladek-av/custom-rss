            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shawn-laydens-advice-on-making-games-faster-and-cheaper.904194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-laydens-advice-on-making-games-faster-and-cheaper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It was back in 2020 when Shawn Layden began sounding the alarm around rising game development costs.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of Gamelab Live, Layden said the current rising cost of AAA game development was become unsustainable, and that when the industry moves to the PS5 and Xbox Series X generation (which was due to take place later that year), the industry might struggle to grow.</p>
<p>Now, four years later, we have caught up with Layden as part of our new GI Sprint series of video, podcasts and articles, which is all around lowering the cost of game development.</p>
<p>"Sadly, it does my heart no good that I think I was right," Layden tells us. "And it wasn't any great prediction. It was watching trend lines of over 25 years of gaming. The numbers only go in one direction. Games don't get any cheaper, they don't get shorter, they get more complex, they become more costly.</p>
<p>"The large blockbusters, when people are swinging for the fences, they're coming in at $150 to $250 million bracket, and that is a huge burden on the game development business model, on the publishers for carrying that, and [that's led] to some of the contraction in the marketplace that we've seen."</p>
<p>Over the next three weeks, we'll be exploring numerous ways that games developers can make games quicker, and therefore at a lower cost. And as part of our opening podcast, Layden shares his views on what studios might want to consider. You can watch the podcast below, <a href="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/GNL8699116738.mp3?updated=1718711208">download it here,</a> or find it on your podcasting platform of your choice.</p>

<h2>Make your games shorter</h2>
<p>One thing developers should ask themselves is whether bigger really is better?</p>
<p>"We live in a world where only 32% of gamers actually finish the game, so we're making a lot of game that 68% of the people aren't seeing," Layden explains. "So should we continue to build games that are unlikely for most of the people to even see the end of it?</p>
<p>"It costs to build to the end. You can tighten that up. If you can make your games on a shorter timeline that will reduce your cost. It'll get you to market faster, you can please your customers sooner rather than always telling them to wait 45 years for your next opus. I think we just have to reexamine how we present ourselves and our games to the gaming public."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We live in a world where only 32% of gamers actually finish the game, so we're making a lot of game that 68% of the people aren't seeing"</p></blockquote>
<p>Layden believes length is not necessarily the deal breaker that it used to be.</p>
<p>"It was such a big deal in the early days of gaming. In the PlayStation 1, 2 and 3 generations, [length] was like your top review poin. We kept judging games by you know how much gameplay you get for your dollar. And maybe that was a decent metric back in the times when the average gamer was late teens/early 20s, which means they're time rich and money poor, so having to sit down for that long of a sesh to get through some huge RPG seemed reasonable. I just think now the average age of gamers is approaching early 30s, you got the flip, they're more money rich and time poor. You have to really kind of strap on some free time if you're going to sit down with Red Dead Redemption 2 and get through that.</p>
<p>"We need to understand what our customers are looking for. Do they want a high impact, high enjoyment piece of gaming, which may not include large sections of the game where you're going on a quest to find this blue rock to bring it to the red Troll and he'll open a door for you. It's just kind of like burning time. It's called grinding for a reason."</p>
<h2>Stop chasing photorealism</h2>
<p>So much investment is going into areas such as ray-tracing, but are we spending too much time, effort and money on visual improvements that the majority of our players aren't noticing?</p>
<p>"We've made a lot about the visual quality of games, the graphic quality, the resolution, the near photorealism that so many games seem to chase," Layden says. "And our fans thought that was a was a was a noble journey, and we saw the difference between graphics on PlayStation 1 where Lara Croft is 800 polygons and, if you squint, kind-of looks like a person. And now we get to the highly realized modelling. But did it improve the gameplay? Did it improve the story?</p>
<p>"I don't believe you can get across the uncanny valley, I think that will always be just five steps ahead. So instead of chasing that, let's go back to exciting game design. I love a good anime. I love highly realized animated characters. They are exciting, because they can tell a different kind of story."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We're in the realm of graphical differences that only dogs can hear"</p></blockquote>
<p>Layden says that we're approaching a point where the improvements we're seeing on the screen are not even being noticed by most players.</p>
<p>"The console war began as a missile race. With each side trying to push the edge of tech. People talked about teraflops all the time without really understanding what it meant. You had all these different kind of metrics that people were throwing around," he says.</p>
<p>"But we've got to the point now where you have advanced ray-tracing and most of the platforms can do 60 frames per second, some can do 120, which your eye can't register anyway. I think we're at the edge of that universe now, we're in the realm of differences that only dogs can hear. And maybe that's not where the emphasis should be anymore. So let's go back to… what can I do that would be amusing, entertaining and interactive so that someone would want to spend their money and time, and enjoy themselves in a way that means they get value for money, and we can continue to pay at least living wages or better to the people who make them."</p>
<p>But will gamers really be ok with shorter games that aren't pushing the graphical side?</p>
<p>"Well you don't say the quiet part out loud [Laughter]. Again, let's stop looking at the game as merely a collection of time-based activities with a certain visual acuity to it. Let's create an activity that would be fun, and these are the rules, these are the characters… and not be begin to deconstruct a game simply based on whether its frame rate held 60 every time. You don't deconstruct movies like that."</p>
<h2>Get the machines to do more of the work</h2>

 </a>
<figcaption>No Man's Sky is a big game made by a small team, and was achieved via tech</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the subject of AI, Layden believes there is a need for programmers to start building tools that will enable some automation in the development process.</p>
<p>"The way we make games has essentially remained unchanged in 40 years," he says. "When the game gets more complex, or there's more heavy lifting to be done, or we need more art assets… typically we've just thrown people at it. Or we hire some people in Malaysia or Eastern Europe and throw them at it. Labour has always been the default response for increased workload and scope of game. People in the interactive entertainment business, certainly on the coding and programming side, are some of the smartest minds out there in computer science. And we need to make the machine do more of the work.</p>
<p>"We need to get more heavy lifting out of the technology, build the toolsets and build the engines that can help. I look at what happened with the guys at Hello Games with No Man's Sky. A game with ultimately infinite scope, but it's essentially done by less than 10 people because they spent a lot of time building the pipeline, the toolset, which allowed them to create over and over, making the machine do most of the procedural heavy lifting. We need to get more of that into gaming."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We need to make the machine do more of the work."</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the AI tools will help with that, but Layden doesn't believe AI will be building games for us.</p>
<p>"AI will be an assisting technology," he says. "Of course, you've got some large business consulting group claiming that by 2030 50% of games will all be written by AI… that is not going to happen. AI only sees in one direction, which is backwards. It puts stuff together to make you think you're seeing forward, but you're really not, you're just seeing a rehash of backward. AI is kind of like the really eager intern that you can say: 'hey give me nine pages on something' and they're like 'sure boss' and they crank it out. But you do have to fact check. AI hallucinates and goes off the rails.</p>
<p>"It's a great tool for taking a bunch of knowledge into a space and summarizing it in four paragraphs. It's really good at that. I think we'll see it doing more first draft work. Some of the video AI kits that are out there means you can mock up a scene pretty fast to get an idea of whether something looks interesting. So in that ideation phase it can help speed things up. But I don't see it writing games anytime soon."</p>
<h2>Be disciplined and murder your darlings.</h2>
<p>Finally, Layden says be strict with deadlines, and that we can all learn a thing or two from how sports games are made.</p>
<p>"One thing we see in studios is they will hold on to a thought or an idea or a wish, and you have to constantly interrogate what it is you think you're doing," he says. "Speed up proof of concept, speed up proof of tech, so you can make the hard call and say 'that's not working'. The people who continue to try to make the thing work over an extended period of time… they're thinking if we just do a little bit more we can get there, but the rest of your game is sometimes just waiting for that mechanic to be established and it's going to slow you down. You've got to have a disciplined idea of what you want to make and how you going to make it. Hold your deadlines tight. Don't be slippy slippy on your alpha or beta Target.</p>
<blockquote><p>"You've got to have a disciplined idea of what you want to make and how you going to make it. Hold your deadlines tight. Don't be slippy slippy on your alpha or beta Target"</p></blockquote>
<p>"Look to teams that do it right. Any team that builds an annual sports game… that's a wonder to behold. They do a new game in nine months every year. At my old shop, where they do MLB: The Show in San Diego… Major League Baseball is not changing opening day. It's April 1st every freaking year. You can say 'well, they know what they're doing. It's the same 32 teams, it's the same stadia, it's the same players where they just have to move them around.' Yeah, because they've identified what their variables are year to year, then they have a list of things they can add. They take care of all the maintenance of moving the players around, updating stadia, getting new face scans… and then here are some new things to add. But there's a date when you go 'that's it, feature locked, we're done'.</p>
<p>"You want to be able to have [time for] people to be inspired and come up with new ideas and really have a flash moment where they've solved the problems of the universe. But you've got to have a strong hand in production management. It's: 'That feature is great, but we've missed the window to put it in. If we do, it'll break all these other things. So hold on to that, we'll come back to it."</p>
<p>Ultimately, if we can get back to making games in three years, the thought of dropping an idea or a feature becomes more palatable.</p>
<p>"If you can turn games around in two to three years rather than five to six years… it's easier to set aside an idea because you go: 'I'll get back to it in two years'. In the current model, if you don't get this idea in now, there may never be a chance to get it in."</p>

Now that the message has officially concluded and all of the Straw Hats except Luffy have made it aboard the escape ship, there isn’t much left to resolve this arc.

 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">We already know that Vegapunk brought books from Ohara island to Elbaf. For a while, it looked like we would finally get the Shanks and Luffy reunion, but Shanks left Elbaf to potentially hunt down Blackbeard. Even so, Elbaf has been spoken about for years and it will be interesting to finally see what the island of giants has in store for the crew. </p>

        <p>How congestion will be eased for Dawntrail.</p>

            <p>
Square Enix has shared its plans to ease congestion in Final Fantasy 14 ahead of the launch of its new expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a>.
</p>
<p>
A new blog post explains login caps could be reached quickly resulting in longer login queues, although the maximum capacity of servers has been increased by "roughly 50 percent" compared to the launch of Endwalker.
</p>
<p>
During a preview for Dawntrail, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">producer and director Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer</a> there was "almost no chance" of server woes for the launch of the expansion - now we can see specifically the measures in place.

</p>

</figure>
<p>
Login queues are expected to be longer than usual, but Square Enix said the queueing process is still functioning even if it does not appear to be counting down. Cancelling the queue will send players to the back when reattempting to log in. Further, players on the full version of the game will be prioritised over those on the free trial.
</p>
<p>
Data Center Travel and World Visit systems will be limited from launch until the release of patch 7.01 (or patch 7.05 at the latest) to alleviate congestion. However, Square Enix does suggest players consider travelling to less-crowded worlds outside of peak times.
</p>
<p>
Players who are inactive for over 30 minutes will automatically be logged out, plus new characters cannot be created on a world experiencing congestion (but can still be created outside of peak times).
</p>
<p>
Two error messages may also be seen frequently. The first is "Error 2002", which occurs when login servers experience high traffic and is a measure to prevent servers from crashing. Square Enix recommends attempting to log in at a later time.
</p>
<p>
The second is "Error 90002" and "Error 90006" during gameplay, both caused by network connection errors.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, new areas as part of Dawntrail's main scenario are expected to receive heavy traffic, so several instances of these areas will be implemented to ease congestion.
</p>
<p>
More information on these measures can be found on the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/655f2cdb22f4c473e4f34abf58e9d4042f7e3ea3">Lodestone blog</a>.

</p>
<p>
The release of previous expansion Endwalker resulted in major server issues, to the point <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-so-popular-its-been-pulled-from-sale">the game was pulled from sale altogether</a>. Square Enix is aiming to avoid similar issues this time and has added a number of new data centres and worlds globally.
</p>
<p>
Dawntrail will release on 2nd July (or 28th June for those with early access) across PC, PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
I recently went hands-on with the expansion and described it as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">Final Fantasy 14 at its most colourful</a>".

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls 6 Reveal Teaser Trailer | Bethesda E3 2018</p>
      </div>
<p>"Now that we're working on Elder Scrolls 6, we get to see it here in the studio, you do miss it," Howard said, calling back to an earlier part of the interview regarding the Fallout franchise where he had said he doesn't think it's necessarily a bad thing for fans to miss their favorite series. "[We] appreciate all of those thoughts and are with the fans on that. We're working hard on it and one day we'll have it for everybody."</p><p>Howard has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">previously questioned</a> whether it was the best choice to announce Elder Scrolls 6 so early, saying "I probably would've announced it more casually." Former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-announced-elder-scrolls-6-so-early-because-fans-came-with-pitchforks-bruce-nesmith-says/1100-6518603/" data-ref-id="1100-6518603">weighed in on the question</a>, saying the studio probably wouldn't have announced the game so early if it wasn't for fans with "pitchforks and torches" wanting to know if the next Elder Scrolls game was in development.</p><p>The announcement teaser for Elder Scrolls 6 was fairly basic, showing only a landscape superimposed with Bethesda's logo, and the Elder Scrolls VI title. Very little else has been revealed about the game in the years since, with the sequel's setting, subtitle, and plot all still a mystery. Elder Scrolls 6 isn't expected to release until 2026 at the earliest.</p>

            <p>
Steam Next Fest 2024 has formally ended, we've spent a couple of weeks gorging upon demos of all stripes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-9-favourite-demos-from-the-summer-steam-next-fest">from oil spill clean-up to dancefloor kendo</a>, and now comes the all-important process of deciding which of those demos Won. Valve have helpfully shared <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed">a list of the most played Steam demos</a> during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I <em>am</em> surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The big-bottomed craft-me-bang in question is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/">Once Human</a>, which cuts you loose upon an Earth infested with Stardust. A world's worth of Stardust sounds quite enticing, right? Touch of Disney with your wolf-skinning, guvnor? Wrong, Stardust is some kind of horrible endemic lifeform. Consuming water or food contaminated with it will drive you insane. I assume the Stardust plague is also the reason for those towering tentacle bosses you'll meet when not fishing or building a patio.
</p>
<p>
Number two on the list is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/">Level Zero: Extraction</a>, which is kind of PvP GTFO for squads of three. You are a dudemerc with a fondness for loot, pitting your murdergadgetry against other dudemercs in maps of the Area 51 or Black Mesa persuasion. You can also play as a perfidious, evolving alien creature equipped (should you choose) with an EMP scream and invisibility. The creature's key weakness is that it can't bear light, which sounds like a fun constraint to strategise around. GTFO aside, this reminds me of the wonderful, ill-fated Evolve. The demo is still live at the time of writing if you're keen.
</p>
<p>
And then there's number three, which is where we go off-piste somewhat. According to a Google translation of its Steam blurb, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1416920/Chinese_Online_Game/">Chinese Online Game</a> is "a simulation game that stitches all the gameplay and routines of domestic online games, where players will play an older unmarried young man, Lao Wang, because of a lack of money for marriage, he was accidentally attracted by a pop-up advertisement of an online game endorsed by a certain star when he was trying to find a way, and at that moment the gears of fate began to turn." Not open world, not a crafting sim, not a shooter, not military-themed = intriguing! The art feels like a purposefully ramshackle collage of MS Paint-level 2D art with a moderately posh 3D action-RPG buried inside it. There's no English language version, but I might have a go at the demo later (also still live at the time of writing). Bear in mind that you won't see it unless you use the "Narrow by" option to stop the list excluding certain languages.
</p>
<p>
Some other eye-catchers from the full list: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/">Aloft</a>, a floating island sim featuring wingsuits that reminds me of Bossa's Worlds Adrift; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-degenerate-gamblers-is-a-warped-dd-spin-on-blackjack-with-an-enjoyable-demo">I tried the demo for a while back</a>, and which now looks like a credible alternative to Balatro; and the aforementioned <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2748340/Goblin_Cleanup/">Goblin Cleanup</a>, in which you are a goblin maid labouring to restore and replenish a dungeon before the next bunch of cavalier adventurers swan in and wreck the place. You can read about more Nextival demos over on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">the Wishlisted hub</a> we are pleased to share with the fine folk of Eurogamer and VG247.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> creator and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said mass layoffs won't happen at the studio "as long as this company is my responsibility".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/fromsoftware-boss-addresses-gaming-industry-layoffs-as-long-as-this-companys-my-responsibility-i-would-not-let-that-happen/">PC Gamer</a>, Miyazaki discussed layoffs across the games industry, in particular the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">number of studios being closed under Embracer</a>.

</p>
<p>
"Speaking to myself and this company, I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at FromSoftware in a million years," said Miyazaki. "I'm pretty sure our parent company Kadokawa understands that and shares that view."

</figure>
<p>
Miyazaki compared his view to that of the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-iwata-halves-pay-miyamotos-wage-cut-too">famously took a pay cut to avoid layoffs</a>.

</p>
<p>

"I think it was the old ex-president of Nintendo, Iwata-san, who said that 'people who are afraid of losing their jobs are afraid of making good things.' I'm paraphrasing that, but I totally share this view," said Miyazaki.
</p>
<p>
"I think it's true. And I think the people at Kadokawa, our parent company, understand that I hold this view very strongly. While we can't say 100% - we can't say with complete certainty what the future's going to hold for From and Kadokawa - at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that's something I would not let happen. So hopefully our players and our fans can take a little bit of assurance from that."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-on-bringing-elden-ring-to-a-close-and-the-future-of-from-software/1100-6524337/">Gamespot</a>, Miyazaki discussed the studio's evolving identity and players' trust in the studio, describing the next chapter of FromSoftware as coming down to "value and how we create this value".

</p>
<p>
Of course, the company has new directors and designers that may have different specific ideas to Miyazaki, so he was loath to say too much.
</p>
<p>
"But if you look at it more broadly, I think it all comes down to creating and providing that value to gamers and being able to do that at 100 percent," he said. "So, making sure the environment is conducive to that type of thinking, and [creating] a path to be able to achieve that is to me what I think as the president and how I feel about the future of the company. So in reality it's a very simple company, I would say.
</p>
<p>
"For the immediate future, I think how fans have responded to our games, and I daresay the amount of trust they've placed in us as a brand, has provided us with this opportunity to be able to show different types of value that we can add. So I think our job at this point is to not betray that trust and expectation."
</p>
<p>
That trust in the brand certainly boosted the sales of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. "I am very thankful for the fans who have responded and embraced that trust that we've built together," said Miyazaki. "So I understand Armored Core was never a huge franchise adopted by many players, but seeing the current state of the franchise I think makes us know that we're on the right path. And I think the same can be said for me as well as the company as a whole."
</p>
<p>
Still, on an individual level, "the sense of overcoming challenges and the dark fantasy world setting is something I will always have," said Miyazaki, even if the company evolves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, in a previous interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-still-hasnt-made-his-ideal-fantasy-rpg">Miyazaki stated he still hasn't made his "ideal fantasy RPG"</a>.

</p>
<p>
Mass layoffs have impacted much of the games industry, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-salary-increase-for-all-employees-this-year">over 10,000 in 2024 so far</a>. Still, Japanese studios have avoided such measures: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-salary-increase-for-all-employees-this-year">Capcom, for instance, announced a salary increase for all employees this year</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-preload-file-size-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree releases this week on 21st June, across PC, Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-art-director-explains-why-the-studio-went-with-a-vibrant-colorful-style/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Obsidian Entertainment first <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc-by-obsidian-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> Avowed with a CGI trailer in 2020, the game looked a lot like Skyrim in terms of the fairly dark, gritty art style. However, the 2023 gameplay reveal showed a different, more colorful artistic direction that initially didn't sit too well with some fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/avowed-interview-carrie-patel-matt-hansen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> to Screen Rant at Summer Game Fest, Obsidian Art Director Matt Hansen finally addressed the studio's aesthetic choice for Avowed. He also explained that players will experience a variety of biomes within the Living Lands.</p>
<p><em>For me, I am a big fan of fantasy games and fantasy genre. I'm also a big fan of vibrant worlds. What you often see, and it's a really useful effect, is a lot of fantasy games will go with a more muted palette, a grimmer look, because it's an instant draw to nostalgia. You immediately feel like you're being transported to an older world because we associate that color palette with history, even though in reality, history was just as vibrant as today minus all the LEDs and things like that.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to tap into that just because I think conflict is so much more interesting when it's in color, in full color. Also, just the world is a wonderful palette to draw inspiration from. The other half of that is the Living Lands itself, as it's referenced in our prior games, is this exotic and very dangerous place. When people think of exotic and dangerous, they think of things like poison dart frogs and all of these very vibrant forms of danger. We wanted to tap into that here as well, but also, within Avowed, there are areas where it is a little more muted. We can play into that duality and play into those contrasts.</em></p>
<p><em>Humans perceive contrast - that's how we perceive everything, the contrast between things. Having an area that's a gloomy swamp, and going from that to a vibrant red desert, to an ashy waste and flipping between all of those different areas, it makes the world feel very, very grand. The Living Lands is a single continent, but it feels like you're traveling across the entire planet between all of these different biomes, so we really wanted to tap into that.</em></p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Avowed will feature optional third-person camera view (in addition to the already confirmed first-person view) as well as the ability to respec your character. An article published on the Obsidian blog <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-release-date-revealed-by-obsidians-game-director-but-quickly-gets-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a November 12 launch date, although it was quickly amended - the studio is likely not ready to confirm it. The action RPG will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X, launching day one on Game Pass.</p>

What should be a reliable monster of a weapon has for so long been fickle, with its anti-tank homing missile failing to properly track locked-on targets.</p><p>According to the update 1.000.402 patch notes, there’s a fix for the Spear not targeting several entities (spawners, compound objects, etc). This should encourage more players to bring the Spear onto the battlefield.</p><p>And here’s another helpful fix: Hellbombs now get called down facing the player, rather than away from the player. Players have got used to Hellbombs facing away from them, so there will be a bit of unlearning to do with this one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Viper Commandos Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Arrowhead updated the known issues list, too, outlining what the studio is working on fixing with upcoming patches.

Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><h2>Helldivers 2 update 1.000.402 patch notes:</h2><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>For this patch, we have made improvements and changes to the following areas:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Quality of life improvements</li><li>Crash fixes</li><li>General bug fixes</li></ul><p><strong>Fixes</strong></p><p>Crashes</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed various crashes that would sometimes occur when changing settings.</li><li>Fixed potential crash or corrupted font texture when changing the language</li><li>Fixed a crash that might occur after exiting a mission.</li><li>Fixed a crash that occurs when opening the social menu with more than 100 friends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Sony Pictures Entertainment has confirmed that an Uncharted film sequel is in the works.</p>
<p>The news was shared by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/sony-cineeurope-the-beatles-zelda-quentin-tarantino-1236039944/">Variety</a> last night, after Sony made mention of the Uncharted sequel at CineEurope 2024.</p>
<p>The first Uncharted film released back in 2022, starring Tom Holland as treasure hunter Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as his mentor Sully. While the film received mixed reviews on its debut, with words such as "tedious" and "colourless" being bandied around, it still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-adaptation-sees-strong-ticket-sales-despite-lackluster-reviews">managed to do well enough at the box office</a>. It opened at the international box office to a respectable $21.5m from 15 overseas markets.</p>
<p>Soon after its cinematic debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-marks-the-start-of-a-new-sony-franchise-and-nolan-north-wants-in">Sony Pictures boss Tom Rothman declared Uncharted a "new hit movie franchise for the company"</a>. So, where could the Uncharted film series go next? Please <strong>be aware of spoilers</strong> for the Uncharted film and game series below.</p>

</figure>
<p>
The first film served as an origin story for Nathan Drake, introducing him to both Sully and Sophia Ali's Chloe Frazer. Elena Fisher - Drake's main love interest from the video games - was noticeably absent from the 2022's release, so it would seem likely that she will be introduced in some form for the sequel.</p>
<p>Additionally, the film itself wrapped up with two obvious teasers for future instalments. The first showed a chap who was evidently Nate's long lost and assumed dead brother Sam in prison writing a postcard to his sibling. So, the sequel could focus on Nate's realisation his brother is in fact alive, with story points similar to those from Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.</p>
<p>The second scene that played out during Uncharted's credits showed Mark Wahlberg's Victor "Goddamn" Sullivan bursting onto the scene sporting a newly acquired moustache and touting a gun (see header image above). Prior to his facially-furnished arrival, however, we saw Tom Holland's Nate in the process of exchanging his iconic ring to a man named Gage for a Nazi map. Oh, and it was revealed Gage was working for a chap named Roman.</p>
<p>This exchange could be an Easter egg, or it could be a hint that Gabriel Roman from first game Drake's Fortune will be making a showing in the sequel, along with that German U-boat our hero finds in the jungle at the start.</p>
<p>What would you like to see in Uncharted's sequel?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-remake-of-the-end-of-the-greatest-rpg-of-all-time">The Remake Of The End Of The Greatest RPG Of All Time</a>, or TROTEOTGRPGOAT for, uh, short, is a game that exists. I normally wouldn’t let such an opaque stub of a description survive outside of a quick Trello reminder to write something better later, but I’m currently finding it fulfilling enough just to gaze upon that title and consider the fully formed art object that may soon emerge from its tantalising promises. Ok, so the visual component helps too. Orientate yourself by means of the trailer below, and let’s dig into this brazen nose-hooker of a head turner of a game that does exist, about another game that doesn’t.</p>

<p>TROTEOTGRPGOAT comes from Coin Drop Games, and despite the title, it actually sounds closer to a puzzle game. The idea is that you’ll navigate the final hour of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that never existed and - with help from an in-game manual, developer commentary, and a fictional unreleased documentary - learn how to solve its many challenges. It also sounds like there’s a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-beginners-guide">Beginner's Guide</a>-esque throughline of meta-commentary around the ways we communicate about games.</p>
<p>Usually, when a project’s operating on this many layers of pomo, you might expect the actual beauty of the original object to take a hit. Dissection rarely leaves a pretty cadaver, after all. But there’s a detail and lushness to the visuals here that reminds me a little of  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveller</a>, an art style which I believe terms like ‘HD-2D’ and ‘rotoscopic’ were thrown around, although I’m not sure if they actually mean anything. Still: game look nice! It may not surprise you to learn I am officially a Big Fan of the pirate skelly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conquering-total-war-warhammer-3-as-a-pirate-with-a-pathological-aversion-to-ever-touching-grass">writing about undead pirates</a> being one of my most treasured pastimes.</p>
<p>Coin Drop Games themselves are three University of California students, who originally started work on the game as part of a class, and they’ve also enlisted some collaborators to help. The Remake Of The End Of The Greatest RPG Of All Time doesn’t yet have a release date, but it’ll drop on both PC and Mac when it does.

            <p>Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-delays-sims-like-life-by-you-again-but-wont-commit-to-a-new-release-date">multiple delays</a>, Paradox Interactive has cancelled its Sim-like game, Life By You.</p>
<p>Announcing the cancellation last night, deputy CEO <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Mattias Lilja</a> called this decision "difficult", stating it was a "clear failure on Paradox's part to meet both our own and the community's expectations".</p>
<p>Lilja went on to explain why the studio ultimately decided to cancel its release, rather than continuing to delay Life by You further. The exec said while "a time extension was an option", it eventually became clear "the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain".</p>

<p>"This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realising them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop," the deputy CEO wrote.</p>
<p>Lilja said Life by You's cancellation was "tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project", particularly given how far into the process the game was.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay," Paradox's exec continued.</p>
<p>"So, how do we ensure we don't find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we'll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn't reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we'll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that."</p> <div>

<p>It has been a rough time for Paradox recently. In addition to news of Life by You's cancellation, back in April, the company along with developer Colossal Order issued a stark apology for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">state of Cities: Skylines 2</a> and the release of its recent DLC, admitting to fans: "We let you down". The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">companies refunded those who purchased the DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parted ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years. It cited not being able to "find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties" as the reason for this split.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-habbos-return-in-habbo-hotel-origins-a-relaunch-of-the-2000s-chatroom-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>You forgot about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/habbo-hotel">Habbo Hotel</a>, didn't you? Habbo Hotel. With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. "Habbo Hotel is back!" is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.</p>
<p>Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, sorry. In an act that will make grown adults across the western world cry out as they inspect their own faces in mirrors and understand that time is both vaprous and immutable, the developers of Habbo are relaunching the oldest version of Habbo Hotel they have. </p>
<p>"After discovering an old decrepit server with some long-lost files at the beginning of this year," say <a href="https://www.habbo.com/community/article/34151/launching-tomorrow-habbo-hotel-origins">the Habbolords in a news post</a>, "...long-time Habbo developer and player Macklebee has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005."</p>
<p>They are launching the minigame-filled virtual chatland today, and have posted a short video <a href="https://x.com/Habbo/status/1802656425790906650">promoting it on Xitter</a>, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180314/habbo-hotel-2005-origins-release">noticed by Polygon</a>. This will be "an iconic version of an iconic game with a fresh, community-led approach," they say. The community-led bit refers to what the developers are doing in one area of the game, which will become "a kind of democratic forum where we will ask important questions about the development and direction of Habbo." Players will be able to vote on whatever is discussed, and the decisions, we're told, will be binding. Experience tells me there will be limits to this. Direct cyberdemocracy does not always go smoothly. </p>
<p>For anyone deeply confused about Habbo history, I have previously written about the game as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-habbo-hotel">currency-obsessed realm of baseball caps and virtual materialism</a>. It is a bit like proto-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. Both in that it shares a target audience of children and has seemingly no logic to its dreamlike world(s). It is free-to-play but is not, I  emphasise, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">best free games</a>.</p>

			<p>Starfield can be made to run at 120 frames per second on Xbox Series S, although with some compromises in visual quality that some may not be ready to make.</p>
<p>As shown by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FuzionXboxTesting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzion Xbox Testing</a> in a new video, the latest role-playing game by Bethesda can hit the 120 FPS mark in some scenarios on the Xbox Series S with the help of a few mods, such as Uncap FPS for Series S, Performance Tweaks, Performance Shadows, Remove Grass, Crowd Reducer and No God Rays. Even with the resolution reduced to 720p by the Performance Tweaks mod and the turning down of multiple graphics settings, the console can't keep a steady framerate, so the experience won't be exactly smooth, but it is definitely worth a try, even just to experience high framerate gameplay on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-scope-impacted-xbox-series-s-4k-30-fps/">weakest current generation console.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: 60FPS/120FPS Update/Mod - Xbox Series S Gameplay + FPS Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hNneSYUbn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release last year, Starfield was regularly updated with new features and content, the latest of which was the Creation Club. The first big expansion, Shattered Space, will launch later this year and will allow players to experience <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/">a new story set on a single planet around the size of Fallout 4's Far Harbor expansion</a>, which requires around 15 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

        <p>The industry veteran shares his views on the current state of the video games business</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Tencent advisor and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has criticised the games industry's lack of patience during this period of widespread layoffs.</p>
<p>Layden's comments came during the opening podcast for GI Sprint, which is a new series of videos, podcasts and articles around the subject of making video games cheaper, faster and better. The full podcast goes live later today.</p>
<p>The current industry situation, which has seen tens of thousands of redundancies across the business, has been caused by slow growth and rapidly rising costs. And Layden says a side effect has been impatience from games companies when it comes to new ideas and concepts.</p>
<p>"That's the real frustrating thing when you see people say 'look here's a small studio that made a great game, it has true promise, it created an entirely new gaming experience, but we don't have the patience to play this thing out into part two or part three'," he began.</p>
<p>"Even though they didn't really get wiped out by it, they didn't have the windfall profits they expected and so they just kill this thing and go for more established AAA IP, sequels, copycats, and things that from a financial perspective you can draw a through line and say if we build this game it likely perform like this in the market. When you bring completely new things that people have not seen before, which may be fantastic and quite often are, the publishing industry doesn't have patience now to nurture these things, and they feel they need the quick big win. And that's a terrible place to be in an entertainment and creative industry."</p>
<p>Layden says it is ultimately the new ideas that will be what gets the industry – particularly the AAA console industry - out of its current predicament, not established brands and franchises.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of the planet has already said Grand Theft Auto is not that interesting, Call of Duty is not that interesting," Layden says. "They were both huge hits in our in our little village of gamers, of course.</p>
<p>"If people have already said they're not interested in that experience, building more of those experiences will not get them in. It seems pretty axiomatic to me."</p>
<p>He continues: "How does the entertainment industry continue to grow and expand and reach new people? And to my mind that's through innovation and through bringing out new kinds of games. So okay, you don't like first-person shooters and you don't like RPGs, here's something else, here's a rhythm action gaming piece that's all about music and bright colours and having a good time. Where's the space for those games? And how do we continue to provide outreach to get new people involved in the interactive entertainment world?"</p>
<blockquote><p>"We went through this time of artificial growth during the pandemic, and I would have expected more companies to recognize that it was a limited time party"</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds that patience works both ways, too. Game companies need to show patience when nurturing new ideas, but also patience when reacting to what's going on in the market, citing the industry's over-excitement during the lockdown years.</p>
<p>"We went through this time of artificial growth during the pandemic, and I would have expected more companies to recognize that this is a very limited time party people," he tells us. "Make hay while the sun shines, but don't make huge investments against what you think is a never ending 20% growth rate year on year, because that's not continuing. But people got excited in the moment. They didn't want to miss the opportunity, and so you bulk up. None of us knew how long the pandemic was going to last or lockdown was going to last, so I guess you do make investments to try to jump on the potential that that may be longer than it turned out to be. But that's a huge gamble. You're betting on the comet, and if it doesn't happen then you're stuck out of position with a huge labour load.</p>
<p>He continues: "It's human nature, right? If you're at the craps table and someone's got the hot hand and they're running the table… you just want to jump on that train and get a piece of that before it goes. That's why patience is the thing that's important. The industry is losing patience. It's 'we need to find a way to solve this problem in six months' in an industry where nothing gets done in six months.</p>
<p>Layden says it's ultimately the smaller studios and companies who suffer the most, who may have been acquired during this period of excess with the promise of creative freedom, only to find themselves having to cut back because of growth concerns by their parent company.</p>
<p>"They say we love the creatives and we're going to let them do their thing and build the great games. 'You're the experts on that, we just want to help you realize your goal'. That's fine and good. But the minute the money thing gets a bit tight across the whole enterprise, all of a sudden the companies come back to all the studios and say we're in a tough spot, we're going to miss are profitability targets, so everybody's got to take a haircut," Layden explains. "And some of the smallest studios are going: 'why do I need the haircut? You bought me for a little bit of money to give me some freedom to do the thing I do… I didn't tell you to spend double digit billions of dollars on buying other stuff, which means all of a sudden we will be the sacrificial lamb because you've got to make that balance sheet work.'</p>
<p>"It's not a true offer when they say: 'we're going to buy you and give you all of your autonomy… unless, of course, our other financial agencies force us to close you'."</p>

            <p>
The sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie now has a firm 2026 release date.
</p>
<p>
In a "this is Miyamoto" social post ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">today's Nintendo Direct</a>, the Mario creator revealed the full release date for the animated film sequel: 24th April 2026, in Japan.
</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2024/240618.html">Nintendo</a> also stated it will be released earlier in the US, 3rd April 2026, with "other countries and regions" during April 2026.

<p>
Once again, the sequel will be co-produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri and Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto, with Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic directing, and a script from Matthew Fogel.

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. Movie was a huge success for Nintendo</a>, earning $500m globally to become the biggest video game film adaptation ever.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">Nintendo announced the 2026 release for the sequel</a> back on Mario Day in March this year, but now we have an exact date.

</p>
<p>
"We've come a long way from Bowser's brief cameo in Wreck-It Ralph, when Nintendo famously gave notes on the correct way for Disney's animators to show Bowser holding a teacup," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-review-an-entertaining-advert-for-everything-nintendo">Eurogamer's thoughts on The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.

</p>
<p>
"Illumination's version of this world, made hand-in-white-glove with Miyamoto himself, undoubtedly allows for more freedom - though, perhaps unusually for Miyamoto, steadfastly refuses to upset the tea table itself."

            <p>
Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the "same" money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.</p>
<p>This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are <em>finally</em> getting to the point here - has just been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146170/Baten_Kaitos_I__II_HD_Remaster/">rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster</a>. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

Our hard-beset guides writer Jeremy Blum <em>did</em> play Baten Kaitos properly as a youth, but he can't write this post because he's caught in the anaconda coils of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> tips-writing (I hear there's some kind of expansion out this week?) so you'll have to settle for my sparse memories and what I can glean from the Steam page. Battle-system-wise, Baten Kaitos is notable for smushing together active-timey combat with card-battling - the essence of your items and abilities are stored inside Magnus cards which are played in real time. I think the CG/real-time mash-up was what had me hurrying back to Gamestation originally - it takes a while to bed in. I'm interested to experience/hear about how it measures up in today's world, where role-playing card games are as abundant as dandruff.</p>
<p>The plot, meanwhile, casts you as a guardian spirit shepherding a party of destiny-defiers through a luxuriant, organic landscape not worlds away from Final Fantasy X's Spira or the archipelago of Chrono Cross. As for what the remasters add, here's a bullet point rundown care of our indispensable ally Mr Blockquote. If Mr Blockquote's insights aren't enough for you, the console versions of the remasters from last year were <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/14927-baten-kaitos-i-ii-hd-remaster-review">pretty positively reviewed</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The two titles have been fully remastered in HD, including retouched battle backgrounds, character graphics, and UI.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy Baten Kaitos with even more vibrant visuals.
</p>
<p>
・ Aspect ratio expanded from 4:3 to 16:9 for play on wider screens!
</p>
<p>
・ Main character and boss graphics have been completely renewed in vivid detail!
</p>
<p>
・ All-new menu screens! Enjoy smoother gameplay with refreshed menu layouts, newly added sorting features, and more.
</p>
<p>
Pre-existing graphics have been used for in-game maps as well as some screens and character models.
</p>
<p>
• New Features for Better Gameplay
</p>
<p>
Along with improved graphics, the features below have been added to make game progression much smoother!
</p>
<p>
・ Auto-save feature
</p>
<p>
・ Help menu containing terminology and hints for progressing through the game
</p>
<p>
・ New Game+ mode, unlocked after clearing the game once, which starts a new game while retaining all magnus, levels, and ranks
</p>
<p>
・ New Game- mode, a mode with level restrictions for an extra thrilling challenge
</p>
<p>
Six new game system options have now been added, including adjustable game speeds and no-encounter mode.
</p>
<p>
Save your settings as a Custom Set and turn them on or off at any time. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's currently selling for £40.49, $44.99 or 44,99€ with a 10% launch discount. Back in the early noughties I'd have gotten at least four game purchases out of that money, but alas, Gamestation is dust, though I guess there's still the terrible temptation of exploiting that two-hour refund window on Steam. Get ye behind me, Satan!

            <p>Life By You, the Sims-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> previously troubled by several delays, has been canceled by Paradox Interactive, and Californian studio Paradox Tectonic have been shut down. The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">forum post</a>, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/following-life-by-you-cancellation-paradox-interactive-closes-paradox-tectonic">GameWatcher</a>.</p>

<p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” said Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester, in the manner of a CEO making what’s increasingly looking like the sort of decision such people in the game industry don’t actually find all that difficult to make. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project, we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio,” he said, echoing the refrain used by such people in the game industry who don’t actually seem to consider such a decision all that tough.</p>
<p>In last year’s <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-january-december-2023">financial report</a>, Paradox Interactive <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/paradox-financials-2023">reported record revenue</a>, but a decrease in profits. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> made them big bucks in the last quarter, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">despite launch woes</a>. On the other end of the spectrum, there was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$23 million flop</a> of strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lamplighters-league">The Lamplighters League</a>, prior to which they laid off a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-to-write-down-lamplighters-league-costs-confirms-layoffs-at-harebrained-schemes">“significant portion” of studio Harebrained Schemes</a>, who they then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">cut loose</a> last October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> itself has been subject to several delays leading up to this point, the most recent being an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">indefinite delay</a> back in March. The game was originally set to launch at the start of this month, on the 4th of June. Last August, Katharine (RPS peace) found a demo of the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-humans-are-always-watching-you-and-some-of-them-can-be-real-creepy-about-it">quite promising</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected in what has become a saddening and frustratingly common occurrence for developers of late. Just this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-shut-down-alone-in-the-dark-rebooters-pieces-interactive-creators-of-magicka-and-titan-quest-dlcs">Embracer shut down</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alone-in-the-dark">Alone In The Dark</a> reboot studio Pieces Interactive.

The Ultimate Team-style game is definitely not as polished as <em>EA FC 24</em>, but it definitely feels nice to play, and is a solid foundation for STRIKERZ to build on.

			<p>Elden Ring might have received a perfect score from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech</a> and many other outlets, ending up with tons of Game of the Year awards in 2022, but that doesn't mean it's the ideal fantasy RPG for creator Hidetaka Miyazaki. FromSoftware's president <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/im-still-in-the-process-of-making-my-ideal-fantasy-rpg-says-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazaki-while-elden-ring-is-not-quite-it-its-getting-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> PC Gamer that it's pretty close, but there's still room for improvement. He also wishes someone else would make it instead - that way, he could enjoy it as a player without knowing every single element in the game.</p>
<p><em>You might say that trying to capture the excitement of those old tabletop games and game books was one facet of making Elden Ring. I think more than anything, it's just my personal preference when it comes to RPGs and exploring those fantasy worlds, so you might see some of my personal idiosyncrasies come into play with Elden Ring there. I think that excitement, for me at least, comes from seeing that world map and piercing together that world map. So when we finally got to do that and start piecing that together when making Elden Ring, that was a really nice moment for me personally.</em></p>
<p><em>Back when doing interviews about Elden Ring, I think I mentioned that I'm still in the process of making my ideal fantasy RPG. And while Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close.</em></p>
<p><em>It's hard to say without giving spoilers for my next idea or our next games. But I think one thing that's not necessarily missing but makes it difficult to achieve my ideal is that when I play it, I know everything's going to happen. I already know everything that's going on. So, in terms of enjoying the game from a player's perspective, I'd love to not know that and for somebody else to make my ideal fantasy game, please, if possible. Then I can enjoy it just as a player.</em></p>
<p>Who knows if Miyazaki-san will ever get his wish? What we do know, however, is that the review embargo for Shadow of the Erdtree is up in just a few hours. Stay tuned on Wccftech to read what we thought of the first and last Elden Ring expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/magic-hazards-journey-bringing-a-story-driven-shooter-to-life-with-xsolla-accelerator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>With more games in the market than ever, it’s important to bring new ideas to stand out. That’s something Magic Hazard has at its core for its debut game Memory Lost.</p>
<p>Set in the dystopian cyberpunk-inspired metropolis of Detraxis, it’s a top-down action shooter where you play as an AI, the Neural Network, implanted into the body of an assassin robot who’s fighting for their freedom and destiny. What makes it unique from other games in the genre is that you can change how you play by capturing the memories of your enemies and gaining their abilities. This results in diverse and adaptable gameplay where over time players can master a wide range of mechanics without the need to create and level up a new character repeatedly.</p>
<p>Speaking to studio founder and CEO Sergei Kuznetsov, the idea came one cold February morning as he and a few friends sat around a kitchen table talking about the types of games they enjoyed playing from their childhood, and what they felt was missing.</p>
<p>“After five hours of discussions, we all agreed: since childhood, we've wanted to play as the enemies we fight against. Not just outwardly, but inwardly as well - using their weapons and abilities,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>While some games like Halo allow players to acquire enemy weapons, these inexperienced but passionate young developers wanted to take the idea further by actually shifting and taking over a defeated enemy’s body, claiming their abilities for yourself.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image-(3)_lqkPxkO.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>“You can find different types of enemies, providing new possibilities to control them,” he explains. That’s not just limited to weapon types but also different playstyles. “You can decide to capture someone who's got a melee ability, and you can upgrade your skill to improve your melee.”</p>
<p>But Kuznetsov was also interested in not just the mechanical possibilities but what this meant narratively. “If you inhabit an enemy's body, you copy his life. You travel in his skin, encounter his environment, and see significant memories,” he explains. “Will this make you view the enemy differently? Possibly. Maybe not sympathize, but at least understand the motivation.”</p>
<p>Of course, the game has also been balanced to ensure players are always adapting. “Our game designer did a lot of work to balance everything,” Kuznetsov explains. “So if you use up all your ammo and can't use your gun, you will need to find a new enemy to mind-capture.” You can even shift to a larger enemy who has more maximum health with strong melee, though they’re also slower moving, and as they’re a rarer enemy type it’s not easy to capture another replacement if you decide to shift to another body.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We spent around two years only developing four hours of gameplay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To avoid combat from becoming stale and monotonous, players are also constantly supplied with new variables, from new environmental hazards to avoid or use against the enemy, to new enemy types, which of course the transference mechanic also allows for new playstyles.</p>
<p>Development of Memory Lost began in 2020, starting with just five people - a programmer, a game designer, two novice 3D artists, and a novice 2D artist. “For the first five months, we brainstormed ideas, created a general concept, and studied the new field for ourselves,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>More members gradually joined the project after that, including a few members from another studio whose prototype had fallen apart, eventually reaching 19 people. But while Magic Hazard was fueled by the passion for the concept, this was still a young and inexperienced team trying to figure out how to take Memory Lost to the next level, while Kuznetsov took on another job and other weekend side gigs to fund the team.</p>
<p>After a year of work, they presented the prototype to a panel of experts at DevGamm, consisting of representatives from publishers and marketing. Kuznetsov recalls it had been a brutal baptism of fire in terms of criticism but that when he followed up with emails he also received generous and detailed constructive feedback. Just some of the points raised included the lack of clarity when using the transference mechanics, a lack of variety in enemies and skills, flat level design, as well as a need to improve animation and visual impact.</p>
<p>“We went point by point to improve the game, reworking from scratch for half a year, and then presented it to them again,” he says. Comparing the initial build to how it is now, there’s also a clearer structure in how the combat and challenge evolves as players progress. For instance, Kuznetsov describes the initial chapters as having the following combat cycle:</p>
<p>1. Training - one enemy spawns at a time, a warm-up for introducing you to the flow.</p>
<p>2. Omnipotence - increasing enemy count, but which you’ll also have the necessary variety of firearms and mechanical mastery to handle, as players have a feeling of superiority and full control.</p>
<p>3. Challenge - quicker and larger enemy spawns with mixed weaponry, which pushes the player to master the mechanics in order to progress.</p>
<p>All that concludes with spaces afterward for players to take a break and explore the environments, giving them the time to resupply themselves but also discover bits of narrative in the world.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/8_pioBL6v.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The team has improved the game following feedback from DevGamm and Xsolla Accelerator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As development continued, it was also becoming clear that Magic Hazard would need more assistance to get Memory Lost to the shape it needed to become competitive. “With no experience, you try to do something good but don't understand the amount of resources you need to do it,” Kuznetsov says, citing that deciding to make a narrative-driven game with entirely hand-crafted levels and an aim of providing six hours of gameplay added to the difficulty of development.</p>
<p>“A lot of games like roguelikes, you can create half an hour or an hour of gameplay, focusing on smaller pieces of assets but provide infinite ways to play,” he explains. “But if you choose storytelling, the things that you have to do are a lot more. We spent around two years only developing four hours of gameplay.”</p>
<p>But inspired by campaign-led games from the 1990s and early 2000s, this was something the team wanted to concentrate on, with more than 90,000 words of text capturing the team’s love of dark humour. That narrative isn’t just delivered from lore drops in the environment but also through dialogue, as your heroine, the Neural Network, is accompanied by two observers, MARK (Mobile Assistant of the Corporation Worker), a kind of mentor and colleague coexisting inside the same body, and the Liaison, a representative from the corporation Redsky who also created you. How you engage with NPCs, such as killing, sparing or ignoring them, can also affect the narrative, with multiple endings to unlock, making Memory Lost not just a one-and-done experience.</p>
<p>The external lifeline Magic Hazard needed came from Xsolla, which Kuznetsov had already been acquainted with after a meeting in late 2021. Fortunately, the company announced plans to launch Accelerator the following year and was looking for developers with interesting game ideas. After submitting its latest demo build, the studio successfully joined the programme.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Now I understand how to prepare beautiful presentations with gifs or videos that help people looking at your pitch"</p></blockquote>
<p>A major incentive for Kuznetsov was that Accelerator provided financial aid. While the team had been scraping by funding themselves for two years, the additional funding would be able make the overall package more appealing, such as more animated cutscenes and voice acting, which are important elements for an immersive story-driven game.</p>
<p>Being on the year-long programme also provided the team with lectures and mentorship, which really helped in all facets of improving Magic Hazard as a game business. “You have consultation hours where you can ask help from specialists in any area, from game design, to marketing, to publishing, and they’ll try to find a specialist to provide services to you,” says Kuznetsov.</p>
<p>One of the most important things he learned might also be typical for inexperienced game developers. You may have a good idea but you need to know how to sell it to your audience. In the very first instance, this meant how to effectively pitch the game to investors and publishers. “My pitches before were basically Google Docs,” he laughs. “Now I understand how to prepare beautiful presentations with gifs or videos that help people looking at your pitch understand the possibilities and features of our game.”</p>
<p>While the extra guidance and resources led to new features could also be implemented in the game, it also meant improving the beginning in terms of onboarding and teaching players the mechanics. An even better way to introduce Memory Lost was the decision to release a free Steam demo, subtitled Chapter One and including the first two levels, which received more than 90% positive feedback. “It’s actually less than 200 reviews,” Kuznetsov admits. “But after feedback from Accelerator and other experts helped us to improve the game, we’re really happy to receive that feedback.”</p>
<p>Magic Hazard is now collaborating with ESDigital who will be publishing Memory Lost later in 2024. “Of course, you just click a button and you can publish on Steam, but without a publisher, it's easy to release a game and no one will know about it. So I really hope the publisher will help us deliver information about our game to a lot of players around the world.” The publisher is also helping port the game to multiple platforms as well as with localisation and QA to ensure Memory Lost is in the best shape to reach as many players as possible.</p>
<p>There were still many other great ideas from Accelerator that Kuznetsov says the team wasn’t able to implement due to time, though he’s hopeful they will be considered in Magic Hazard’s future games. That’s a promising sign for a studio’s future prospects, which is apt as Accelerator isn’t just there to help a studio with one game but to ensure they can thrive as a business.</p>

        <p>Initially announced last March, early access release of the life sim had been delayed three times</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Paradox Interactive has cancelled its upcoming life sim Life By You.</p>
<p>The publisher's deputy CEO Mattias Lilja shared the news on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Paradox Forum</a>, citing that the game didn't meet its or the community's expectations.</p>
<p>"Life By You has been in the works for a long time and we've been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game," Lilja wrote. "We opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realising the potential we saw.</p>
<p>"For each delay we made, we've seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture."</p>
<p>Lilja went on to explain why its latest early access release, set for June 4, and said that the studio felt the game was "lacking in some key areas."</p>
<p>"Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain."</p>
<p>Life By You was to be the debut title for Paradox Tectonic, an internal studio formed in 2019 and led by former Electronic Arts executive vice president Rod Humble.</p>
<p>The game was announced in March 2023, with an initial early access release date slated for later that year. This was delayed three times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/oneodio-monitor-80-professional-headphones-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s a steady push for listeners to experience music, movies and games exactly how the creators intended, and if you’re serious about it you’ll want a pair of monitor headphones. By their nature, these are tuned to have as close to a flat EQ as possible, replicating the original audio without embellishing the bass or other elements. Many monitor headphones are premium, expensive options, but OneOdio are continuing their drive for top-class audio in a budget package. Priced at £99.99, the Monitor 80 come close to achieving that aim, but there are some caveats to be found thanks to its pricing.</p>
<p>The OneOdio Monitor immediately stand out thanks to their huge, egg-shaped hard case. It’s encased in faux-leather, boasts a chunky zipper, and proudly sports the OneOdio logo printed on top. It makes a good impression, even if it is outsized.</p>



<p>Nestling inside, you’ll find the Monitor 80 and two cables, one coiled and one straight, both with 3.5mm cable tips to plug into at the headphones end. They connect to different sockets though, with one boasting an old-school ¼ inch head, and the other 3.5mm. The headphones boast a 250-ohm impedance and an open-back design, meaning that you’ll need a decent amp to get the most out of them, and that everyone around you will hear what you’re listening to.</p>
<p>The headband boasts a plush leatherette covering and is embossed with the OneOdio logo, setting a great first impression, but after that the first true signs of the lower pricepoint begin to show, with the connective arms and central joints being fashioned out of cheap-feeling black plastic. The plastic offers the advantage of a lighter headset, but it doesn’t feel at all premium. The sizing adjusters are at least metal, and click reassuringly into place, and stay in the same position even after repeated uses.</p>

<p>The velvet ear cushions are pleasingly soft, and feel comfortable against your skin for extended periods of time, but the headband turns out to be a little too hard once it’s on your head. It could have done with an extra few millimetres of padding to help keep things comfy, and you’ll definitely start to feel it the longer that you wear them. It’s a real shame, especially when the low weight and soft earpads lull you into thinking they’re going to be a gentle fit.</p>

<p>The Monitor 80 are Hi-Res certified, meaning that they’re capable of reproducing higher-resolution music if you’ve got a suitable provider, such as Tidal or Apple Music, and an output device that can produce Hi-Res audio. Fortunately, I was able to test the Monitor 80 with my MacBook Pro, and a series of Hi-Res music files, before also trying it with an external DAC.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s little of their own colour to the Monitor 80, and if you’re listening with a flat EQ on the source device, you’re getting a pretty close approximation of the creator’s true vision. That said, the 40mm drivers pick out the top-end details with such clarity that they can be a little harsh unless you temper it in some way. As a work tool, for both music or audio production, they’re absolutely going to help you dig into every note and tone, but as a regular listening tool they might be too much for some.</p>
<p>That said, with some tuning I found a lot to like with the Monitor 80’s audio output, and Hi-Res music sang through. The new Nerv single sounded suitably epic, with its chugging guitars retaining a vicious edge that matched well to Dillon Jones’s powerful vocals. Meanwhile, ‘Apocalypse’ by Bridges Ablaze boasted plenty of percussive punch to its math-metal, with each kick drum beat feeling fully formed and well-rounded, without any hint of distortion or bloat.</p>

<p>The only true downside to using the Monitor 80 for an extended period became the headband. I found it really started to weigh on me, and while I admittedly have little in the way of natural padding thanks to shaving my head, it’s not something that’s a problem with the best headphones. The Monitor 80’s laser-focus on audio reproduction also means that there’s no microphone, something which headphones will often feature as a small unit on one of the cables.</p>
<p>In terms of competitors, the Monitor 80 isn’t a traditional pair of headphones, so you have to consider them against similarly focused sets. I own a wonderful pair of Philips Fidelio X2HRs that OneOdio have certainly cribbed from along the way, and are, surprisingly found at more or less the same price of £110. They’re similarly Hi-Res certified, have a more comfortable floating headband, are more premium-feeling and only really miss out by not coming with a case. Still, if I had to choose between the two, the Philips set would win every time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-uncharted-movie-confirms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In 2022, the first Uncharted movie debuted worldwide, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake. It was a commercial success, bringing in almost half a billion dollars at the box office and setting up a surefire series of movies to follow – if the closing scenes of the first movie were anything to go by, at least.</p>



<p>Recently, Sony confirmed that a second movie is in the works, once again starring Holland as Nathan Drake (which is pretty obvious) and Mark Wahlberg as Sully (again, fairly obvious). When the first movie dropped, it was referenced that plans existed to turn it into a series – and that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-drake">Return of the Drake</h2>



<p>During a recent appearance at the CineEurope trade show, Sony Pictures took to the stage to talk about everything that’s in the works, from 28 Years Later to the biopics based on The Beatles. Sony’s representatives also addressed the ‘Uncharted sequel’, which is set to be a direct follow-on from the 2022 movie – but the full title is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>That wasn’t the only live-action adaptation touched upon at the presentation, as Sony also spoke about the Legend of Zelda flick that’s in production (<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/sony-cineeurope-the-beatles-zelda-quentin-tarantino-1236039944/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to Variety</a> for the tip).</p>



<p>In the last two or three years, live-action adaptations of video game franchises have exploded in popularity, with many series emerging to an overwhelmingly popular reception. Most recently, we saw The Last of Us and Fallout appear on streaming platforms worldwide, stunning audiences and even scooping awards as a result of their stunning levels of cinematography.</p>

        <p>Stockholders also invited to approve equity incentive plan to better retain talent</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson's compensation increased 22% year-on-year to over $25.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>This included his base salary of $1.3 million, stock awards representing over $20 million, non-equity incentive plan compensation of $3.4 million, and other compensation for more than $500,000, as per EA's annual meeting report and proxy statement for FY24.</p>
<p>This compared to a $20.6 million compensation in 2023.</p>
<p>Wilson is EA's executive with the highest compensation, followed by president of EA entertainment, technology and central development Laura Miele, at $12 million for FY24.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>, EA execs collectively earned over $60 million in 2024.</p>
<p>"Our board of directors, compensation committee and EA management are committed to maintaining pay-for-performance alignment in our executive compensation program," the document read.</p>
<p>"Our pay-for-performance approach is designed to reward the achievement of company-wide financial and business objectives, individual performance, and the creation of long-term value for stockholders, while also recognising the dynamic and highly competitive nature of our business and the market for top executive talent."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the document, stockholders were invited to approve the reinstatement of EA's 2019 equity incentive plan, which would see the number of shares of common stock increase by 2.1 million.</p>
<p>The move is "critical to attract and retain talent," EA said, noting that "the digital interactive entertainment industry continues to undergo dynamic change and transformation, creating an intensely competitive market for workers from an active and mobile talent pool."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-cutting-5-of-workforce">EA cut 5% of its workforce in February</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shut down Ridgeline Games</a>. In 2023, it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-restructuring-laying-off-6-of-workforce">already laid off 6% of its staff</a>, representing around 775 people at the time.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-changes-executive-compensation-scheme-cuts-execs-2021-pay">EA overhauled its exec compensation processes</a>, capping executive bonuses among others. That year, Wilson's compensation had reached $39.2 million, an 83% surge over FY2020. In 2022, that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-ceos-salary-drop-to-usd19-9-million">dropped to $19.9 million</a> and has been slowly going back up since.</p>
<p>For FY2024, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-madden-have-ea-posting-full-year-growth-despite-sleepy-q4">EA's revenue reached $7.56 billion</a>, a 2% increase over 2023.</p>

			<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> from the Embracer Group's latest financial report that the Alone in the Dark reboot and the new Outcast game didn't do very well commercially.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Alone in the Dark developer Pieces Interactive has now been shut down by Embracer. The news came directly from the Swedish studio, which <a href="https://x.com/PiecesInt/status/1802612988286804218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> just a farewell image on Twitter/X. No other communication is currently available from either the developer or publisher.</p>
<p>Pieces Interactive was founded in 2007. The studio previously helped Arrowhead Game Studios with Magicka 2 and its DLCs. In 2017, they were acquired by Embracer. Their first projects under the umbrella were two Titan Quest expansions: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/titan-quest-ragnarok-odin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarök</a> and Atlantis.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Alone in the Dark reboot was supposed to be their big break, but despite high-profile actors like David Harbour and Jodie Comer, it didn't work out. That doesn't mean you should avoid playing the horror game if you've been on the fence; Nathan Birch quite enjoyed it, rating the game 7 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Despite my complaints, I have to admit, I still enjoyed this new Alone in the Dark overall. Maybe I’m just a sucker for that old-school survival horror feel, or maybe Alone in the Dark’s faults just didn’t sink in too deeply as no one section of the game sticks around all that long. Your first time through the game will take around 7 or 8 hours, although multiple playthroughs are encouraged in a number of ways. As mentioned, Edward and Emily’s stories aren’t that different, but a variety of collectibles, secrets, and unlockable endings will keep some happily in the dark for a while, although others may feel the urge to flick on the light switch before they collect everything.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is just the latest of several closures at Embracer, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volition</a>, Campfire Cabal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/timesplitters-fans-have-their-hopes-crushed-once-again-by-new-closure-of-developer-free-radical-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Radical Design</a>, as well as many other layoffs that were part of the group's restructuring plan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-starfield-paid-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-said-bethesda-%E2%80%98hears-the-feedback%E2%80%99-about-paid-for-starfield-mods.904068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-starfield-paid-mods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently found itself in hot water again concerning Starfield. With the recent launch of the ‘Creations’ platform on Starfield came a slew of paid-for mods, with BSG stuffing some content behind paywalls locked down tight with ‘Starfield Creation Credits’ requirements blocking the way forward. </p>



<p>One particularly troublesome mod was the Trackers Alliance mission called ‘The Vulture’, which was put behind a paywall costing 700 Creation Credits (around $7). It’s the second part of a line of missions, and the biggest concern here is that the first part was free to consume. However, in a recent interview, Bethesda’s Todd Howard revealed that the firm is aware of the feedback and is preparing to adjust how they deliver similar content in future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-better">Do Better</h2>



<p>Almost ten years ago, Bethesda Game Studios tried locking some Skyrim mods behind a paywall – and that went down like a cup of cold sick. It seems that history has been doomed to repeat itself because, unlike Tony Stark, Bethesda doesn’t learn from its mistakes. In a recent interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard confirmed that BSG ‘hears that feedback’ and is going to ‘take a look at that and how we deliver content like that’ further down the line.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The addition of these paid mods caused hundreds of users to pour onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-review-bombed-bethesda/">Steam to review-bomb Starfield</a>, which took a nosedive in ratings as the controversy unfolded. Despite Howard appearing in the interview to defend the price point and stressing that there’s a substantial amount of content wrapped up in it, users were still (understandably) vexed by the decision.</p>



<p>Howard said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We need to evaluate both pricing, what we put out for free, how we communicate what’s in something, and really hear from the community there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other news, Starfield fans were left disappointed following the recent Xbox Games Showcase when Shattered Space received a new trailer but <strong>still </strong>didn’t get a release date. This is the highly anticipated first major expansion for Starfield, but despite being revealed long before the game was released in September 2023, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shattered-space-release-date-coming/">still doesn’t have a launch date</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last month, Paradox Interactive announced that it was going to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-delayed-indefinitely/">indefinitely delay its Sims competitor Life By You,</a> and now the publisher has gone a step further by cancelling the project outright. Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive, released a statement as to why Life By You has been cancelled, with the key points being an uncertain development timeframe, a failure to meet expectations, and the game not delivering in important areas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life by You | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9c3WEYTJIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the statement, Mattias Lilja said, <em>“Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You. This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations. We realize this raises some large questions; here we hope to shed at least some light on why we opted to cancel, rather than delay as we communicated earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>Life by You has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game. Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. For each delay we made, we’ve seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.</em></p>
<p><em>A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate Life by You, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</em></p>

<p><em>At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/20/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-heads-to-early-access-in-september/">Life By You was revealed in March 2023,&nbsp;</a>with Paradox aiming for a September 2023 early access release at the time. As that date neared, Paradox pushed the early access release to March 2024, before delaying the game indefinitely, and then making the decision to cancel it outright.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/todays-nintendo-direct-will-be-light-on-first-party-games-leaker-says-says-fans-should-manage-expectations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's Nintendo Direct will be "light" on first-party titles, but it might very well contain some surprise announcements.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-back-half-2024-announced-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo announced a new Direct</a> episode for later today, and fans have been speculating about the broadcast's contents. Will we finally see more from <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-reveal-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>, and what about the long-rumored<a href="https://wccftech.com/life-by-you-canceled-paradox-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess Switch ports</a>? Well, according to reputable Nintendo leaker 'Pyoro', fans might do well to manage their expectations. In addition, the leaker said that, while he does expect some surprises, Nintendo won't be showing a lot of first-party games. "It will be light on 1st party stuff but I expect some surprises", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802900013112336868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X when asked about Nintendo's own titles.</p>
<p>In a more recent post on X, 'Pyoro'<a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802936397038531046" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted a rather cryptic set of emoticons</a> before <a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802938088416805076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> "Summer is here". Following these posts, plenty of fans seem to believe that Nintendo will be announcing either a new Mario &amp; Sonic title during the show or possibly a new Tomodachi Life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no further details were shared by the leaker, and we'll just have to wait until later today to learn what Nintendo has up its sleeve for the back half of this year. As again pointed out by Nintendo, the broadcast won't touch on the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor.</p>
<p>What are your expectations from today's Direct episode? Will we finally be seeing more from the new Metroid? Possibly the new rumored 2D Zelda entry? And what about the rumors about a new Star Fox?&nbsp; Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Today's Nintendo Direct will air at 10 am ET. We'll update you as soon as more information about the Direct comes in. Of course, we'll be covering the broadcast once it airs.</p>

<p id="7e50o5">Roggenrola’s shiny debuted during its very own <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2022/9/18/23356686/roggenrola-community-day-shiny-boldore-gigalith-special-move-meteor-beam">Roggenrola Community Day</a> in September 2022. Gigalith is a pretty decent rock-type attacker, but it has become massively outclassed since its Community Day. You’re better off with Rhyperior, Rampardos, Tyrantrum, or Terrakion (if you have them).</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Roggenrola in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Roggenrola is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

Two weeks before the June 4 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paradox-delays-the-sims-competitor-life-by-you-again-and-this-time-theres-no-new-release-date">it was delayed again</a>, this time without a release date, because, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the words of Paradox Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja</a>, "additional time [was] needed."</p><p>Paradox Interactive released a statement from CEO Fredrik Wester explaining the decision <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-cancels-the-release-of-life-by-you-which-impacts-the-second-quarter-with-msek-208-in-a-write-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on its website</a>. The full statement is as follows:</p><blockquote>Paradox Interactive (Paradox) has today decided to cancel the release of the game Life by You. This means that the second quarter of 2024 will be impacted negatively by MSEK 208 from the write-down of the game’s total capitalized development costs.</blockquote><blockquote><em>For a long time, we’ve held hopes for Life by You and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations. A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release. Moving forward, we should perform at a much higher level, and it’s obvious that we have work ahead of us,</em> said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</blockquote><blockquote><em>We’ve performed poorly in recent releases,</em> continued Wester. <em>Even though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met. We have to evaluate how we manage projects and how we organize, for we will and must get better. We have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future.</em></blockquote><blockquote>This disclosure contains information that Paradox Interactive AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU nr 596/2014).

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-sims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sims</a> has been a massive cash cow for EA, so it wasn’t super surprising when Paradox Interactive announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/life-by-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life by You</a>, their take on The Sims formula developed by a new team led by former Sims boss Rod Humble. Unfortunately, Life by You didn’t end up being the easy layup it seemed like it should be, as the game’s early access launch was delayed multiple times, and now Paradox has announced they’re outright canceling the game.</p>
<p>Here’s what Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to say about Life by You being canned</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You. This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community's expectations. We realize this raises some large questions; here we hope to shed at least some light on why we opted to cancel, rather than delay as we communicated earlier. Life by You has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game. Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. For each delay we made, we've seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.</em></p>
<p><em>A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate Life by You, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</em></p>
<p><em>Our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</em></p>
<p>Paradox Interactive has struggled in recent years, with the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cities-skylines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a> being beset with issues at launch, and games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/star-trek-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Trek: Infinite</a> and the Civ-challenger <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/millenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millenia</a> flopping at launch. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> has also been through a protracted and messy development cycle, with the project’s success being far from secure. A successful life sim would have really added to Paradox’s portfolio, but instead Life by You joins the company’s string of recent failures.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the current state of Paradox? What can they do to turn it around?</p>
