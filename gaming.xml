		<p>Developer DON’T NOD has released a brand new trailer for its sci-fi adventure, which is due to be released in 2026. The brand new trailer confirms a second playable character to provide a different perspective to Ariane, and that new character is fellow astronaut Thomas. The two characters have different ways of dealing with things, with Ariane being more physical as she moves around while Thomas uses his mind to piece things together due to picking up an injury.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aphelion | Hide to Survive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oUUnfGffCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer for Aphelion also shows a creature native, named The Nemesis, to the planet Persephone stalking both astronauts, who cannot fight back. Both Ariane and Thomas will need to hide and move stealthily to avoid detection. Ariane and Thomas are not together in this journey but are looking for each other after crashing onto the planet of Persephone.</p>
<p>Aphelion is due to be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mtg-avatar-last-airbender-everything-you-need-to-know</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtg-avatar-the-last-airbender-%E2%80%93-everything-you-need-to-know.1337482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> makes its way to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in a little less than a month on November 21st, and we just got the rundown of the whole release at a press event. We have some new cards to show off, some new information, and we'll give you the rundown on things specific to this set, some of which you may know already. There's also a look at a Secret lair drop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Where Are the Avatar: The Last Airbender Commander Decks?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To get the biggest question out of the way, we learned why there are no precon Commander decks in the set. It seems so obvious with the four types of airbending right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they were preparing for this set, they sought a lot of feedback about what people wanted from an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set in <em>Magic</em>. The team told us the surprisingly biggest thing people were most excited about was using <em>Avatar </em>as a way to teach people in their life to play <em>Magic</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s generally one of the bonuses to Universes Beyond, but we were told that there was so much specific feedback for <em>Avatar </em>they couldn’t ignore it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it came down to it, they realized they only had the bandwidth to do one of two things: Commander or Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all the feedback they got early on, they went ahead with Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also added that not all of the different bending mechanics lend themselves well to a Commander deck, airbending mentioned specifically. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What’s in the Commander’s Bundle?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Commander is not ignored, however. They are selling a Commander’s Bundle that is very similar to gift bundles in previous sets.</p>

<p>It includes 9 booster packs, one collector booster, 30 <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> lands (15 foil , 15 nonfoil), a click wheel life counter, and some Commander specific staples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Featuring the <em>Avatar </em>art above, the bundle includes five nonfoil promo cards. Three of them are the same in each bundle: a Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, and Swiftwfoot Boots. The other two are borderless versions of “classic” Commander spells.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Jumpstart Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Jumpstart boosters make a return in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, as discussed above. &nbsp;If you’re not familiar, these are packs of 20 cards that are all themed around one sort of mechanic or some sort of synergy.</p>

<p>With Avatar, there are 46 Jumpstart themes in total.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will also be some cards from <em>Avatar </em>that are only found in Jumpstart boosters. Here’s some of them:</p>

		</tr></tbody></table>

<p><em>Avatar </em>will join <em>Arena </em>on November 18th and will feature every card in the set, aside from some art variants that will only be in the tabletop version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique to <em>Arena </em>will be some sleeves, featured above. The Aang and Katara sleeves will be in various bundles you can purchase, one with a ton of packs aimed at people making decks and the other for those more interested in drafting..&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sokka sleeves will be included as part of the Mastery Pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be three pets to collect as well, featuring the animal companions from the show: Appa, a baby Appa, and Momo.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Avatar: The Last Airbender Bonus Sheet&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There will be a lot of source material cards in the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set, 61 in total. Each card will feature a frame or part of a frame of an episode from the show so all 61 episodes are represented.</p>

<p>If you look at the cards, in the bottom left you’ll see exactly which episode that card’s art is from as well. Check out some below.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair – My Cabbages!&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there will be an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>Secret Lair superdrop. There are still details to come on that, like the rest of the drops and the release date, but they did reveal one to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think we all saw some form of this set coming, featuring the cabbage merchant from the show. Each one features new ways his cabbages get absolutely wrecked.</p>

<h2>Art Variants in Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Bloomburrow fans who liked the field notes treatment will be happy to see it return with <em>Avatar</em>. Because the world is so full of weird and unique animals, the team thought the aesthetic fit perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another is the borderless elemental frame, each of which will focus on a specific character and highlight the type of bending they are associated with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to some of the new cards shown above, here are some new cards that you likely haven’t seen yet (aside from the Appa Lands, you’ve probably seen those but if not I included them):&nbsp;</p>

              <p>October brings with it an annual flood of big game releases but a relative desert when it comes to gaming showcases. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtt9pnU_xA">Fall 2025 ID@Xbox livestream</a> did its best to fill that void, teasing updates and new reveal trailers for a number of smaller indie releases you probably don’t have on your radar.</p> <p>If you’re excited as I am <a href="https://kotaku.com/planet-of-lana-follows-in-limbos-lushly-illustrated-foo-1847076146">for <em>Planet of Lana 2</em></a>, you’ll be happy to hear it’s double the length and scope of the original, taking players into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQYZNIOzBE">completely new types of environments</a>. We also got confirmation on some release dates, console ports, and Game Pass day-and-date arrivals. Remember co-op off-road trip <a href="https://kotaku.com/art-rally-over-hill-trailer-minimalist-steam-coop-1851746273"><em>Over the Hill</em></a>? It’s coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. Platformer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcOQY8qhpU"><em>Egg On</em></a>, meanwhile, arrives November 6 via Game Pass on both console and PC. And tower defense roguelike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVZpnNukOU"><em>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp;&nbsp;Road</em></a>, which I’ve really been looking forward to, arrives on the subscription service just a few weeks later on November 20.</p>

 <p>Here’s a bunch of other new game trailers that caught our eyes:</p> <h2><em>Puppergeist</em></h2>  <p>Do all dogs go to heaven? Not in this game. <em>Puppergeist</em> sees a young witch named Claire search for her puppy in the underworld. The only way to find him is by helping other haunted dogs with their troubles through rhythm-based mini-games.</p>

 <h2><em>Awaysis</em></h2>  <p>This 1-4 player co-op dungeon brawler hits Game Pass in 2026. It looks like 3D <em>Castle Crashers</em> with bigger maps and detailed physics gags.<em> Awaysis</em> bravely asks you to consider completing that epic combo while trying not to rag-doll across the level.</p>

 <h2><em>Ungodly</em></h2>  <p>Once upon a time, Mark Otero was creative director on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>. Now he’s making<em> Ungodly</em>, a dark fantasy RPG from Azra Games. There are barbarians, wizards, and lots of monsters. It looks like an over-the-shoulder dungeon crawler. Unconfirmed if it will be monetized like a free-to-play mobile game or be a complete RPG experience. It was supposed to come out this winter but looks slated for later in 2026 now.</p>

 <h2><em>Task Time</em></h2>  <p><em>Task Time</em> looks like <em>Gang Beasts</em> meats <i>Fall Guys</i>, i.e. it’s a party game that takes place over a series of races in which the best-laid plans are easily ruined by a gnarly physics sandbox. “This is your new favourite friendslop,” reads the YouTube description. See, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/focus-group-man-you-have-no-good-car-ideas">they admit it</a>! Still, my kids are going to go crazy for this one, right up until it causes too much chaos and I threaten to never let them play games again.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="title2"><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em></h2>  <p><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em> is a horror noir police procedural set in Indonesia where a covert agent goes rogue to uncover a monster-filled conspiracy. It looks cool and creepy, like indie <em>Silent Hill</em> for Indonesian folklore.</p>

 <h2><em>Don’t Fret</em></h2>  <p>In<em> Don’t Fret</em> you play as a human guitar chased by a giant cassette tape. That’s it. That’s the game. It looks lowkey terrifying.</p> <h2><em>Darkwood 2</em></h2>  <p>The top-down survival horror game returns in an equally moody sequel. You make your way around the “scorched deserts of a dying sea” foraging for food and supplies before night falls. It features an entirely new story so you won’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it.</p> <h2><em>Routine&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>Explore deteriorating environments. Piece together the past. Don’t get eaten by whatever’s lurking around the corner. <em>Routine</em>‘s analog ’80s flavor of survival horror has been in the making since 2012. It finally has a release date of December 4. It’ll also be day-one on Game Pass. Oh, and Mick Gordon (<em>Doom 2016</em>, <em>Doom Eternal</em>) is doing the music!</p>

Unfortunately, Blackwell Fields is a large-scale area with a ton of open ground, causing players to voice their complaints about the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields is set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. The map offers structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and small pieces of cover, but it doesn't feel like enough to cater to all playstyles. Close-quarter tactics are difficult to utilize here, and it can feel overwhelming to try and capture points.</p>

It can be difficult to see threats well, unless you're spotting all the sniper glints coming from the outer hillside portions of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players are upset and sharing screenshots to showcase the map's poor visibility. <a href="https://x.com/BSoD__Gaming/status/1983168594084278624" rel="nofollow ">BSoD on Twitter</a> shares an image of the map and asks, "Can you see the four players crouched on this hill?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>As part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">mass layoffs announced today</a>, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.</p><p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom says in the memo, which Amazon shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Amazon’s MMO lineup currently includes <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, and <em>Lost Ark</em> (which had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944611/lost-ark-mmo-long-queue-times-smilegate-amazon-games">a hot start in 2022</a>), and in 2023, Amazon announced that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23723787/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">developing a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a> in partnership with Embracer Group. Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230555/amazon-games-blue-protocol-western-release-cancelled">cancelled a planned western release</a> of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO <em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was shuttered in Japan in January.</p><p>The company isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">revamped Luna</a> and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqfKmQd2Hs">courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg</a> for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”</p><div><p>In addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDAH6H-5TOs">the MOBA <em>March of the Giants</em></a> and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">a new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game</a> (Amazon is also making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770357/amazon-lara-croft-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-series">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>) and with Maverick Games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166351/amazon-maverick-games-publishing-deal-forza-ps5-xbox">a new open world driving game</a>.</p></div><p>You can read Boom’s full memo below.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear Games Team,</p><p>This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.</p><p>Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.</p><p>We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.</p><p>While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em> as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming <em>Tomb Raider</em> title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.</p><p>Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>—the first game from AdHoc Studio, which was formed by veterans of Telltale Games— contains a lot of “almosts.” It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a revival of the choice-driven Telltale adventure game we’ve been missing for nearly a decade, but without all the walking around and examining the environment while the game was barely holding itself together. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>a superhero story, but it’s mostly a workplace management sim with superheroes in it. It’s </span><i><span>almost </span></i><span>as irreverent as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><i><span>Deadpool</span></i></a><span>, but stops short of its fourth-wall-breaking crudeness. I’m still figuring out how I feel about all of those things rolled together in one package, but I can’t deny I felt a coziness typically reserved for pastel farming sims as I slipped back into the better parts of the Telltale house style.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Robertson III isn’t a superhero, but he </span><i><span>was </span></i><span>a mech-piloting hero who once steered a suit that his father and his father’s father passed down to him. Mecha Man, as the family’s shared heroic identity was known, has become a symbol in a superpowered world where everyone believes they can save the day. So when Robert, voiced by Aaron Paul, is defeated and de-meched by a villain named Shroud, it seems like his heroing days are over. That is, until he is approached by the Superhero Dispatch Network, an organization that assigns heroes to odd jobs based on their various powers and expertise. If Robert can’t be out in the field yet, maybe he can put all those years of hero work to use by guiding others.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639683">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In just its first two episodes, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has all the makings of an old Telltale classic. While the drama of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/if-telltale-s-the-walking-dead-its-ending-on-a-high-no-1829281649"><i><span>The Walking Dead</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/three-episodes-in-the-wolf-among-us-gets-really-good-1561497397"><i><span>The Wolf Among Us</span></i></a> <span>made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/telltale-employees-left-stunned-by-company-closure-no-1829272139"><span>the now-defunct studio</span></a><span> a household name, my favorite game by the studio has always been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-finale-is-its-darkest-episod-1737584368"><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands</span></i></a><span>, which manages to elevate the often tiresome source material into a rollicking action comedy with wit and incredible timing. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>feels most reminiscent of that as a slapstick, raunchy workplace comedy where Robert’s co-workers are a gang of superpowered misfits.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I still haven’t gotten much time with Robert’s team, but I’ve seen enough to know they’re different from other groups at SDN. These guys are a bunch of ex-villains, some of whom Robert slapped around in a mech a time or two. As such, his identity is kept under lock and key from most people in the company, so as far as this team is concerned, he’s just another in a long line of paper pushers SDN has brought in to try and wrangle them into a proper superhero team. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>will live or die based on whether or not it can pull off the interpersonal relationships between Robert and his crew, and the brief flashes in these first two episodes show potential.</span></p>

 <p><span>Invisigal, formerly known as Invisibitch and played by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230"><i><span>Critical Role</span></i></a> <span>star Laura Bailey, gets the most screen time. Her powers of invisibility allow her to shroud herself in mystery to her foes, like she also does to her friends, and she is pretty much actively rebelling against the entire rehabilitation program, despite turning herself in prior to Robert’s arrival. There will no doubt be a lot to unpack with her as the game goes on, but a lot of the other wannabe heroes are enigmas to me right now. I’ve mostly had to intuit who they are through their stats on a spreadsheet, but thankfully, it sounds like that will change in the next two episodes launching later this week.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639684">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is pretty neatly divided into two halves. One is the “Telltale game” half, playing out as a less interactive version of the choice-driven dialogue and QTEs that defined the studio’s previous work, though here you don’t walk around or interact with the environment at all. The dialogue choices you get will change the cadence of conversations and people “will remember” what you say and do, but overall it’s a much less involved experience. The best parts of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>are in the dialogue and the eye-catching comic book-style animation, but so far, the actual experience of playing it feels a little thin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is especially noticeable because of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s episodic format. Unlike Telltale’s games or the older </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>releases, which had episodes come out over the course of several months, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight episodes are rolling out weekly, two at a time, between now and November 12. Two episodes are coming out each Wednesday for the next few weeks, and these first two episodes are bite-sized. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was originally going to be a </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611909/dispatch-preview-adhoc-interview/"><span>live-action television show</span></a><span>, and that feels about right given its brief, TV-episode-length run times. I enjoyed my time with both episodes, but I was also caught off guard when they abruptly ended and the credits started rolling. When Telltale or Don’t Nod did the episodic format a decade ago, it was because it was developing episodes and putting the tracks down in real-time. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>seems to be mostly done, its episodes just haven’t unlocked yet. Ultimately, when all the episodes are out, will its episodic format really matter? Or is cutting a game into eight pieces mostly just a nod to AdHoc’s lineage? We’ll know for sure in a few weeks, I suppose.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about the other half of the game, the actual dispatching? What </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>lacks in more direct control, it makes up for with its pretty entertaining management sim. I was given brief dossiers on my crew and told to send them around town doing heroic things despite their non-heroic attitudes and histories. Surprisingly enough, the big stuff is pretty easy. Baddies are attacking people? Send in Golem, a giant, hulking mud and gunk guy who specializes in defense. Someone needs to reach an objective unnoticed? Probably easiest to send Invisigal because she barely even needs to hide behind cover to get somewhere. It was the smaller jobs that turned out to be more tricky. I thought Invisigal would be able to get a lost balloon out of a tree, but alas, she couldn’t manage it. There was also a point when SDN needed someone to go do some PR, and they decided someone from my group of ex-delinquents would be right for the job. So I had to think a little more creatively about who to send out. There were some obvious non-starters, but Prism is a socialite who dresses like a pop star. She’s probably the one who can sweet-talk the public on a radio show, right?&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000639682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639682">© AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Getting to know your team’s strengths and weaknesses is one thing, but </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s management segments also require you to juggle the crew’s division of labor, breaks, and travel time all at once like any other shift manager. Sometimes a task needs completion but the right person is resting from their last job, so you have to let it sit there and hope they’ve recuperated before the job times out. Other times you just have to send whoever’s on hand and hope for the best. Some jobs are handled by multiple characters, each of whom can handle certain requirements, but even then, you might get pinged to make a call or hack into a system to help them progress. It’s not all chance, and even someone perfectly suited for a given job isn’t guaranteed success. I’ve been trying to accommodate for some characters’ weaknesses by leveling up different stats like intellect or charisma, so hopefully everyone’s pretty well-rounded and reliable by the game’s end.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is doing a lot of things right despite some of my reservations, but regardless of how I feel by the end of episode eight, I’m glad that the Telltale vets at AdHoc are getting to make a game like this again. Despite some bangers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a><span> earlier this year, the episodic narrative adventure genre has largely fallen out of fashion in the years since Telltale fell apart. It’s nice to think these types of games could get a second chance at life, and if </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>helps get us back to that, I’ll just be happy it exists at all.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We received a welcome treat with the launch of Battlefield 6’s REDSEC content, as it included a new DLC trophy list specifically for battle royale and Gauntlet content. Insider Gaming has the full list for you to check out, and for something so short, it’s deceptively grindy.</p>



<p>Once we got wind of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 trophy list</a>, we’d have been forgiven for thinking this would be the extent of BF 6’s trophies. Alas, we were wrong, and we’re glad to say we were. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC battle royale</a> content was introduced with Season 1, and so with it came the awesome new Gauntlet mode.</p>



<p>Gauntlet and traditional BR make up the fabric of the new Battlefield 6 trophies and achievements, so let’s check them out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophies-amp-achievements">All Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long have you got? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The extra Battlefield 6 DLC REDSEC trophy list is like a 3ft powerlifter—Small in stature, but doing a lot of heavy lifting. There aren’t many trophies and achievements here, but they will take you a long time to achieve.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of DLC REDSEC trophies for Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">May the Odds Forever Be in Your Favor</td><td data-align="center">Play 74 matches in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Here’s Your Birthday Present</td><td data-align="center">Deploy 42 call-ins.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector</td><td data-align="center">Loot 10 Superior or Custom items.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stone Cold</td><td data-align="center">Stun enemies 316 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rise from Your Grave</td><td data-align="center">Revive teammates 1988 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Army of Two</td><td data-align="center">Win 7 matches in Battle Royale: Duos.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Never-Ending Game</td><td data-align="center">Play 125 rounds of Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Everybody Fights, Nobody Quits</td><td data-align="center">Win a Battle Royale match as a full squad with total squad survival.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mission Accepted</td><td data-align="center">Complete 214 missions in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dog of War</td><td data-align="center">College 9 dog tags in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mozambique Hotel</td><td data-align="center">Ping a Shotgun in Battle Royale.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies In Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s a small helping of 11 extra PlayStation Trophies and 11 Xbox Achievements to explore, discover, and obtain in Battlefield 6’s optional REDSEC DLC list.</strong></p>



<p>Quite often, when we do these lists, we have to give Xbox owners the bad news that PS users get an additional trophy. This isn’t the case this time around! DLC trophy lists don’t carry a Platinum, so it’s a level playing field for once.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, it’s broken down into 10 Bronze Trophies and 1 Silver Trophy. Happy hunting, soldiers.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the extra list. Should more live-service games add more trophies and achievements as DLC lists?

		<p>Tower survivor roguelite Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has been given a release date by Ludogram and Raw Fury, with the game coming on November 20th. There is a demo available on Steam, which will remain available even after the game is launched.</p>

<p>In Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road you need to defend a moving city from an endless army of monsters that want to tear the city down. To fight back, you need to gather resources like wood, stone, and gold to use to invest in defences, upgrades, and abilities to take on threats from small monsters to big bosses.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters are Coming! so it’s time to get this addictive Tower-Survivor rolling</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, Stefan wrote, <em>“Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, to use its full title once more, is absolutely the kind of game I can see myself losing hours and hours to. Tower defence and bullet heaven survival games are already so satisfying in their own right, and their progeny promises much the same. I’m definitely very keen to play more, with Ludogram currently holding a closed beta test to refine it even further.”</em></p>

<p>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road will be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, it has been verified for Steam Deck and the Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

		<p>The Adepta Sororitas are coming to dish out the Emperor’s justice in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, with the boomer shooter sequel letting you choose between the returning Space Marine Malum Caedo, and new character Nyra Veyrath, one of the Sisters of Battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 - Sister of Battle Extended Cut Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MAMOJqgiaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Sisters of Battle are more than capable of holding their own in battle, despite having nowhere near the augmentations of the Adeptus Astartes – it’s all mad religious fervour and zeal powering their combat prowess.</p>
<p>In Boltgun 2, Nyra doesn’t have the same level of armour as a Space Marine, but she’s much more agile and can use speed, precision and just setting everything on fire to get ahead.</p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving you a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Simon says spells</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>If you're an adventure game fan of a certain age, you’ll have a place in your heart for <strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong>. Part of the first major wave of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-point-and-click-adventure-games-for-nintendo-switch">point-and-click adventures</a> back in the late '80s and early '90s, Simon offered a goofy British counterpart to <strong>Monkey Island</strong>’s swashbuckling comedy.</p>
<p>The series now returns with a faithfully written prequel that will delight long-time fans. Telling the tale of the titular conjurer's beginnings as a magical chosen one, we follow Simon as he gets lost in a fantastical world, learns to wield magic, and meets his long-term antagonist, Sordid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> has all the charm of its predecessors and even brings back <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> actor Chris Barrie, who voiced Simon in the first two games. The dialogue is funny, cynical, and very British. Rick Astley even pops up on the soundtrack for nostalgia-tinged opening credits sequence.</p>
<p>Our sarcastic hero is constantly breaking the fourth wall. At one point, a waypoint appears on your map, only to come crashing down into the actual environment. Elsewhere, Simon frequently looks straight at the player to comment on the ridiculously contrived situations the developers have put him in.</p>
<p>Those situations follow the tried-and-true point-and-click formula of hunting down items and finding ways to use or combine them to fulfil an ever-increasing set of goals. Your bottomless wizard hat stores things of all shapes and sizes. How you use these items in puzzle-solving is seldom straightforward, staying true to the genre’s tradition of clever frustration.</p>
<p>While obtuse solutions are expected of '90s-inspired adventure titles, the logic-stretching still frustrates on occasion. Areas are large enough that it can become a chore to wander through environments, trying all your inventory on everything around you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a user-friendly interface and control scheme make cycling between interactable objects a breeze. Gone is the tedious pixel hunting of yesteryear; now you can flick between points of interest with the shoulder buttons, or reveal everything in the area with a push of the shoulder button.</p>
<p>There's an alternate control system for those who want a bit more of the original's cursor manipulation. Additionally, undocked mode makes full use of the touchscreen. A hint system would have been a good quality-of-life feature, but Simon will occasionally comment on potential solutions.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn artwork is charming, if occasionally clunky. The aesthetic recalls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Return to Monkey Island</a> in its stylised interpretation of the ScummVM-powered heyday. Animation can feel stiff at times, and when the camera zooms in too close, the art does not always hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>That being said, Simon the Sorcerer: Origins is a solid return for a beloved series, and the developers at Smallthing Studios seem more than capable of carrying on these magical adventures.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-reportedly-%E2%80%9Cfar-behind%E2%80%9D-battlefield-6-in-pre-orders-leading-up-to-launch.1337407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, based on data provided by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/">Alinea Analytics</a>, shows that in the lead-up to launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 trails "<em>far behind</em>" the numbers that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was able to pull.</p>



<p>Setting the parameters here: this is based on data from Steam pre-order sales for Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, 18 days ahead of their respective launches. Within that 18-day lead-up period, Battlefield 6 was able to sell close to a million copies in pre-orders. Black Ops 7 has only managed 200K pre-order copies sold.</p>



<p>These numbers start to look even worse when placed beside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-from-release-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-in-steams-top-150-wishlisted-games-is-it-time-for-activison-to-worry">Eurogamer</a> report that spotted Black Ops 7 in the 173rd spot for Steam wishlists. It more or less paints a picture of a player base that isn't exactly looking forward to this year's entry in the long-running annual shooter franchise.</p>



<p>Of course, a few caveats, including the fact that not everyone buying Black Ops 7 on PC will do so through Steam, and that this only accounts for PC players, which says nothing of what pre-orders will be on consoles. There's also the fact that Black Ops 7 will be available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate tier subscribers,</a> which, there may be less of since the recent price increase, but that still represents a subset of players who won't pre-order because they don't need to, they know they'll play Black Ops 7 right at launch.</p>



<p>It's also difficult to really count Call of Duty out. Battlefield 6 has made some impressive strides, like how its concurrent player count on Steam has yet to fall below <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">300K according to SteamDB</a>, the fact that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">sold 7 million copies in just three days</a> (according to Alinea Analytics in this report, Battlefield 6 has now passed 10 million copies), and how at least in the EU, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">beat out the launch sales for last year's Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p>But even that comes with a caveat because last year was the first time Call of Duty was available through Xbox Game Pass. So once again, it's difficult to say that the current fighting shape of Battlefield 6 is enough to topple Call of Duty in its peak form.</p>



<p>Particularly because it can easily be argued that Call of Duty is not in peak form, with the game in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">ongoing identity crisis</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to take every advantage they can, and the fact that Battlefield 6 currently has an edge in pre-order sales with the PC shooter player base is definitely a point in favor of Battlefield, but empires like Call of Duty aren't toppled overnight.</p>



<p>"<em>Call of Duty has an entrenched global audience across consoles and PC - including more casual gamers - that purchases the game each</em> <em>year out of habit and brand loyalty</em>," Rhys Elliot, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics told GI.Biz. "<em>Its causal player base dwarfs Battlefield's, and its integration with Warzone ensures that millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Black Ops 7 feels less</em> <em>exciting to us and the enthusiast media, the sheer reach of Call of Duty's ecosystem - through cross-promotion, platform partnerships, and content cycles - guarantees massive sales volume once the game launches</em>."</p>



<p>And of course, that'll be the ultimate test. When we have sales numbers for November 2025 and player engagement figures from the usual suspects (Newzoo, Circana, Alinea Analytics, GSD, etc.), will Battlefield 6 stand above Black Ops 7 in regional or global charts? That'll likely depend more on what players continue to see out of Battlefield, than what Call of Duty brings to the table.</p>



<p>Today, Battlefield 6 launched its Season 1 update, which included new weapons, vehicles, a new Conquest map, the launch of its first battle pass, and, most importantly, Battlefield REDSEC, the battle royale mode tied to Battlefield 6. This 100-player mode is EA and Battlefield Studios' response to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>So far, it's off to a strong start with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#48h">500K concurrent players on Steam</a>. If things continue to go well, then even if Battlefield 6 isn't able to beat out Black Ops 7 on the charts where it matters, it will have gained a win on perhaps the more important battle, the one within players minds that'll now clearly ring out: there's something else besides Call of Duty that's worth playing and buying going forward.</p>



<p>That said, to match the launch of REDSEC, Activision made Black Ops 6 multiplayer and zombies free for players to try out. The modes you'll usually have to pay for will be free until November 3.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don’t Nod Bringing a “Major IP” to Gaming For Netflix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-bringing-a-%E2%80%9Cmajor-ip%E2%80%9D-to-gaming-for-netflix.1337404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind Life is Strange, is working with Netflix on a new narrative-driven game. Furthermore, the title is said to be of a ‘major existing IP’.</p>



<p>If you’ve played any big narrative games this past decade, chances are a Don’t Nod title was one of them. From the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic Life is Strang</a>e series, the French developer/publisher has quickly become one to watch. Now, in its half-year sales report, the company has a new collaboration: Netflix.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-don-t-nod-working-on-a-new-existing-franchise-based-game">Netflix and Don’t Nod Working on a New Existing Franchise-Based Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t Nod announced its half-year results for 2025 in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new press release</a>. The company reported that it more than tripled revenue, releasing games like Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. While the title didn’t meet sales expectations, upcoming projects like The Lonesome Guild and Aphelion hope to turn the tide. However, the biggest news comes with the announcement of a collaboration with Netflix. The company stated that the narrative-driven project is in development at its Montreal studio. It will be published by Netflix and be based on a ‘major IP’. </p>



<p>As to what that IP may be, there are certainly a few possibilities. Personally, with the style of Lost Records, Stranger Things is a no-brainer for Don’t Nod. Given how it fits the mystery/sci-fi genre it mastered with Life is Strange, it’ll feel right at home. However, Netflix is home to many major franchises like Bridgerton, Outer Banks, Bird Box, and Wednesday, so there are plenty of options. It’ll be exciting to see how it turns out, as I’m both a fan of Don’t Nod’s work and Netflix’s catalog. </p>



<p>What franchise do you want Don’t Nod to adapt for Netflix? Do you have a favorite title of the company? Enjoy Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage?

<section><p>The N64 game's unconventional three-day time limit added an emotional touch to the storytelling that wouldn't have been possible with a more traditional narrative structure.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask celebrated its 25-year anniversary on October 26, 2025. Below, we examine how it leveraged its unconventional time-travel element to tell some memorable stories.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Even a series as storied as The Legend of Zelda has produced a black sheep or two in its long history, but perhaps no installment is as divisive as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/" data-ref-id="5000-1271">Majora's Mask</a>. The second Zelda title released for the Nintendo 64 and the follow-up to the universally acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">Ocarina of Time</a>, Majora's Mask retained much of its predecessor's mechanics and assets, but it reframed them with a recurring three-day structure that proved to be controversial among fans at the time. But while this unconventional time loop contributed to the game's divisive reputation, it also gives it a unique identity among the series, and is the reason the game remains so moving more than two decades later.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Majora's Mask revolves heavily around time travel, it was not the first Zelda game to explore the concept. Time also plays a central role in Ocarina of Time, embodied in the eponymous instrument that allows Link to access the inner chamber of the Temple of Time and retrieve the Master Sword. Once he pulls the sword from its pedestal, he can freely trek back and forth between two distinct ages: his idyllic childhood, and the dark future that awaits Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">Majora's Mask, however, takes a much more fluid approach to time travel than its predecessor, giving Link a greater degree of control over the flow of time itself. Whereas Ocarina of Time had him repeatedly traveling between past and future to ultimately thwart Ganon, Majora's Mask sees Link reliving the same three days as he attempts to stop the moon from careening into the world of Termina. Should time run out before he can complete his mission, he'll have to use the Ocarina of Time to turn back the clock to the first day, buying himself another 72 hours to fulfill his quest--while also undoing all of the work he had accomplished.</p><p dir="ltr">This strict time limit imbues the adventure with a sense of urgency. Fail to clear a temple before the end of the third day and you'll have no choice but to rewind the clock and begin the entire cycle anew, resetting not only your supplies, but the progress you'd made. Puzzles you had completed would be undone, quests would be reset, and characters you had met would lose all memory of the encounter. Not everything reverted with the clock; some key items--and the insights you gained along the way--carried over, but you effectively started from square one every time you rewound back to the first day. This gives the game a distinct flavor compared to Ocarina of Time, twisting its familiar gameplay loop into a unique shape that sets it apart from the rest of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTv_p5hEu0A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTv_p5hEu0A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But as much as the time-travel mechanic changes the complexion of the gameplay, its biggest impact can be felt in the storytelling. Nintendo leveraged Majora's Mask's time loop brilliantly when crafting the game's narrative, utilizing the repeating three-day structure to explore more personal, human stories that couldn't be conveyed through a traditional linear narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the game adheres to a strict time limit, every non-playable character Link encounters in Termina follows a particular routine, which reinforces the perception that they are all going about their lives, whether or not you are around to witness them. The postman diligently makes his rounds every morning and afternoon; the traveling performers hang about the inn by day and rehearse in the square by night; and certain shops only open at specific times. These routines offer an intimate look into the lives of the various denizens of Clock Town, which in turn strengthens your attachment to them.</p><p dir="ltr">Importantly, these routines are not immutable. By interacting with certain characters at specific moments, you could change their trajectory for the remainder of that cycle. Without Link's intervention, for instance, the elderly woman from the bomb shop is destined to be robbed on the night of the first day, preventing the store from stocking the larger bomb bag she's carrying. By learning where and when the crime will occur, however, Link can be in the right place at the right time to drive off the thief, ensuring the item is delivered (and earning a rare mask for his troubles). Depending on how you go about apprehending the criminal, you can even inadvertently blow him up, which not only destroys the bomb bag he'd stolen, but also prevents you from completing a related side quest later on in the cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">This loop--reliving the same three days and witnessing every possible fate that could befall the characters you meet--adds emotional depth to the game's many side quests, and it leads to some of the most poignant moments the series has ever conjured. The plight of Anju and Kafei, the betrothed couple who are separated by mysterious circumstances just before their wedding day, receives the most attention and praise thanks to its complexity, an extensive and emotional mystery that takes several three-day cycles to fully unravel. But the most heartrending side story revolves around Cremia and her younger sister Romani, the owners of the ranch to the south of Clock Town.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592849"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4592849-9437972220-WiiUV.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite its proximity to the city, you're unable to enter the ranch until the third day, as the main road leading into it has been blocked off by a giant boulder. By the time the boulder is removed and the trail is finally reopened, you find both Cremia and Romani mysteriously sullen; neither speaks much, and from the few words they do say, you can vaguely glean that some kind of tragedy had befallen the ranch and its livestock.</p><p dir="ltr">What happened to the pair remains a mystery until later in the game, when you obtain the Goron mask and are permitted to use the explosive Powder Keg, which allows you to destroy the boulder early and enter the ranch on the first day. At this point, you learn the pair are dealing with two interconnected dilemmas. Cremia mentions ongoing harassment from the rival ranch down the road, while young Romani enlists your aid to defend the ranch's cows from a mysterious pack of "ghosts" that invade at night. The ensuing story is one of the more fraught and involved sequences in the game, spanning all three days and requiring deft playing to aid the pair during their respective quests.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if you do manage to successfully resolve Cremia and Romani's dilemmas, however, there is still a sense of sadness lingering over the ranch come the third day. With the townsfolk planning to shelter in place there later that night, Cremia confides in Link that she is fully aware that not even the ranch is safe from the destruction the moon will wreak, and resignedly accepts the fate that awaits everyone. Romani, however, is too young to comprehend the coming apocalypse. Rather than tell her of what will happen, Cremia offers Romani her first chance to have a Chateau Romani--the ranch's specialty milk drink that is exclusively reserved for adults. And on the night of the third day, just as the pair are set to retire for the final time before the moon falls, Cremia tells Link that they'll both see him tomorrow, never letting on to Romani that the world is about to end.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a heartrending scene, especially after all the trials you've endured with the pair, and is a poignant example of why Majora's Mask remains such a captivating experience even 25 years on from its original release. Although the game's unique time loop may have been divisive among fans at the time, it allowed Nintendo to explore themes and stories it couldn't as powerfully convey with a traditional linear narrative, making Majora's Mask one of the most emotionally resonant--and enduring--games the company has ever released.</p>

<p>Lunar Software has been working on Routine since 2013 though the game disappeared from the public eye for a long time, getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">&nbsp;re-revealed in 2022. </a>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat. Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong>&nbsp;– Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay&nbsp;</strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong>&nbsp;– The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown&nbsp;</strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 has just launched, the next few months promising three phases of added content to the hit first person shooter. Titled Rogue Operations, it brings three new weapons, a new map, a new close quarters and a new mode called Strikepoint. There’s also a battle pass, and this is all launching alongside the new REDSEC free-to-play battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 1 Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Umw-SKuh0LY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new map is Blackwell Fields, which brings us one of the largest maps in the game, set in the arid biome of Southern California. It brings plenty of vehicular action – with the Traverser Mark 2 armoured truck –&nbsp;lots of long range sniping opportunity, and will go a good step toward addressing one of the main complaints of the launch line up of maps.</p>
<p>Alongside this is Strikepoint, which is a squad-based elimination mode, pitting two teams of 4 against one another as they battle over a single capture point.</p>
<p>Of course, then there’s tons of cosmetics and unlocks through the themed battle pass, which has 100 tiers (some free, many premium), 6 paths to choose and 10 prestige tiers for the most dedicated players. That comes alongside a big batch of new weekly missions in the game (sadly many of them locked to the battle royale modes) to help boost your standard progressions and levelling.</p>

<p>Two more content updates are coming in the next 6 weeks, with California Resistance launching on 18th November and Winter Offensive launching on 9th December. The first of these brings a new map set in the SoCal suburbs and a new Sabotage game mode, while Winter Offensive will redress one of the New York maps to be all wintry. And then it’s on to 2026 and Season 2.</p>

		<p>Ice Pick Lodge and Hooded Horse have revealed Darkwood 2 during the ID@Xbox showcase, with the game confirmed for PC and Game Pass, though a release date is not yet confirmed. Darkwood 2 is going to be set a few years after Darkwood. You can check out the announcement trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Darkwood 2 says, <em>“In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly – an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why – retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature. All around lie the ruins of a vanished world – deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night – even walls can’t guarantee safety. As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder – is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/14/darkwood-review/">Darkwood Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Darkwood review, Steve said, <em>“Darkwood is one of the most terrifying games I’ve ever played as it challenges you to explore and survive a dark and twisted world. Unravelling the mysteries of the night time horrors will consume you even before you try the permadeath mode. This comes highly recommended, but remember to wear your brown trousers.”</em></p>

<p>Paws for thought</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch eShop is home to its fair share of cosy cat games, but in how many of them is the cat a cute little postie? Do we hear 'gap in the market'?</p>
<p><strong>Catto's Post Office</strong> is coming to fill that exact niche. This one arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2908050/Cattos_Post_Office/">Steam</a> back in August, and publisher Cult Games has today announced that it is pouncing onto the eShop on <strong>2nd December</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll make this clear right from the jump: Catto's Post Office is a <em>little</em> game. Sitting at around one hour in length, this isn't going to be the kind of every-evening cosy experience that you might get from others in the genre, but it sure as hell looks cute.</p>
<p>In it, you play as Catto the Postcat, going about a day's work delivering mail to a quaint little village. Catto has a tiny hat and a postbag. He also wears a sweet little button-up shirt. <em>Still</em> not sold? There's a dedicated meow button, <em>and</em> you can knock over pots. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Here's a look at the game's key features and a few screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>● Charming Open World: Explore a vibrant cat-themed town with buildings you can enter, such as a bakery, a florist, and a café. Admire the whimsical theming, such as pawprints on doors and cat-shaped rubber duckies, and see what easter eggs you can discover. (For example, there are only cat-friendly plants and flowers in town!)</em><br>
<strong>●</strong> Deliver Packages and Make Friends: Make deliveries around town and meet eccentric kitty residents as you go. Assist your new feline friends by completing silly tasks and unravel funny conversations with multiple dialogue choices.<br>
<em>● Everybody Wants to Be a Cat: Meow whenever you want! Hide inside boxes! Knock over plant pots, cans, and even more besides! Did we mention you can meow whenever you want? Seriously, meow whenever you want. (Meow.)</em><br>
<em>● A Wholesome Narrative Adventure: It’s Catto’s birthday and nobody’s remembered - oh no! Be whiskered away by this heartwarming tale about a hardworking Postcat who learns just how valued he is by the friends he helps every day.</em><br>
<em>● Short and Sweet: Taking only 1 hour to complete, this is the perfect snackable experience to snuggle up with for a cozy evening this winter!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like it sticks to the cosy formula that we all know so well, and we're far from being short of cat games, but come on, it sure sounds like a cute way to spend an evening in the run-up to the holidays.</p>
<p><em>Will you be adding Catto's Post Office to your Switch cat catalogue in December? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With each passing month, artificial intelligence creeps into more industries. That does not exclude the gaming industry, which has long used artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, the generative AI that is taking root everywhere offers much more power, and also much greater risk, compared to what gaming developers were used to. Big companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> are already laying off (or thinking about laying off) employees to invest further into artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>What do the actual developers think about this artificial intelligence revolution? Their takes, as you would expect, are quite varied. The creator of Super Smash Bros., Masahiro Sakurai, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks generative AI can help make large-scale development manageable</a>. Hideo Kojima, the man behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding franchises, wants to use the technology to deal with more basic tasks while he can concentrate on the creative parts of game development and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to 'stay ahead'</a>.</p>



<p>Richard Pillosu, co-founder of Spanish indie developer Epictellers Entertainment, shared a similar, albeit more clear-cut opinion <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Wccftech</a>, stating that there is no point in using AI in any creative endeavor. </p>



<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent chat with DayZ creator Dean Hall</a> about his studio's survival game ICARUS, I once again inquired about the stance that Hall and the RocketWerkz team have adopted regarding artificial intelligence. The game designer likened the widespread fears surrounding AI to adults 'losing their mind' when Google's search engine and Wikipedia emerged between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Then, he added that artificial intelligence is here to stay regardless of what people do. At RocketWerkz, they haven't found a need to use it with ICARUS, although Hall said they are using AI as a coding support tool for other projects. The designer reckons there's still some way to go before a more active use case makes sense, but did not seem averse to the idea. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. </em></p>



<p><em>We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</em></p>



<p>While actual game developers share their thoughts about AI usage in the industry, Elon Musk has thrown the gauntlet and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xai-will-release-great-full-scale-ai-generated-game-late-2026-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the xAI division would release a full-scale AI-generated game before the end of next year. It's a highly ambitious goal, but then again, the technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of you, the alien sun reflects of the glinting white&nbsp;plastoid composite plates of a battalion of Stormtroopers honing in on your position. You signal to your rebel comrades to flank them -- this could turn the tide of the war! But then you hear it... the hiss of breath that can only mean one thing: Darth Vader. These are the thrilling moments you can recreate in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Legion</em>, the miniature wargame set in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe. Atomic Mass Games just released new Starter Sets for the game, coinciding with a rules refresh, and they sent us along copies to review. So follow along as we take a trip to the dark side!</p>

<h2>What's Included In The <em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;Starter Sets?</h2>

<p>Each of the new <em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;Starter Sets include everything one player needs to jump into the game. Atomic Mass Games sent me a copy of the Rebel Alliance Starter Set and the Galactic Empire Starter Set, so I'll take some time here to break down everything included in each.</p>

<h3><em>Star Wars Legion </em>Rebel Alliance</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;Rebel Alliance Starter Set includes:</p>

<ul><li>36 Miniatures
	<ul><li>Commander Luke Skywalker</li>
		<li>Rebel Trooper Unit X2 (11 troopers per unit)</li>
		<li>Rebel Commandos Unit X1 (7 troopers per unit)</li>
		<li>Wookie Warrior Unit X1 (6 troopers per unit)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>36 27mm Bases</li>

<p><em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;is a miniature wargame set within the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe (obviously), and players will each field an army all belonging to a faction - we're reviewing the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance starter sets here, but there are also soon-released Separatist Alliance army and Galactic Republic army Starter Sets coming.</p>

<p>In the game, you'll field your army under the keen eye of a commander - in these boxes the Empire starts with Vader and the Rebel Alliance starts with Luke... pretty classic.</p>

<p>You'll take turns activating your units, who have all their stats and abilities represented on cards (included with the starter set, and available for download). As you move your units into position, you'll take shots and begin firing off large pools of dice to see if you've hit your opponent.</p>

<p>Maneuvering around terrain, zipping across the field with speeders, blasting your enemy away with blaster fire... it's all here, and when you're in the thick of battle it feels just like the best fights and skirmishes from the series. Whether the goal of the game is to claim objectives, hold important battlefield points on the map, or just disintegrate your enemies, no other tabletop game I've played captures the <em>Star Wars</em> vibe.</p>

<h2><em>Star Wars Legion </em>Rebel Alliance Unit Breakdown</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;Rebel Alliance Starter Set comes with four unique units: Luke Skywalker, Rebel Trooper Unit (2x), Rebel Commandos Unit, and Wookie Warriors Unit. Let's take a quick look at each one.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-legion-luke-skywalker.jpg?itok=OF4gkKYF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-legion-luke-skywalker.jpg?itok=crEL3urr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is Luke Skywalker, your commander and the hero of our story (sorry Solo stans, I'll always be a "main protagonist" kinda guy). Luke is a very slippery commander, with the ability to use the force to leap across the battlefield, while inspiring those around him to keep going even when they're being suppressed by enemy fire. His blaster has a nice range, but it's his lightsaber that can really knock your opponents around.</p>

<p>From there, we have your everyday Rebel Troopers, who are run of the mill in most ways, but what makes them special is how their ability to gain, spend, and re-gain dodge tokens to get out of trouble. The Rebel Commandos bring more expertise to the tabletop, creeping around the battlefield, scouting ahead and jumping into the action in a surprise burst, and decreasing the cover of their enemies.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a fun surprise inclusion in this set, the Wookie Warriors! Previous sets and releases have shied away from including Wookies in starter sets, as we don't see any Wookies joining the fight (beyond my main man, Chewbacca) in the original trilogy. But I think their inclusion is very smart, as it not only brings some diversity to the army list, but also visually breaks up the camo and beige in a nice way.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-legion-rebel-troopers-and-wookies.jpg?itok=J3oxFMUA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-legion-rebel-troopers-and-wookies.jpg?itok=sHn9NICc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wookies are, as you might expect, a real powerhouse unit in this army. They're the berserkers of this army, able to charge in, bash heads, and spend tokens to increase their odds.</p>

<p>All in all, it's an Army Set designed to strike fast, get in and get out, and deal as much surgically precise damage as possible. But what happens when a sneaky, shifting army comes up against the full might of the galactic empire?</p>

<h2><em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;Galactic Empire Unit Breakdown</h2>

<p>The Galactic Empire Starter Set comes with three unique units: Darth Vader, Stormtrooper Unit (2x), and Scout Trooper Unit (2x). How do they play, and does this Starter Set feel different from the Rebel set?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-legion-darth-vader.jpg?itok=bvZ6mBT7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-legion-darth-vader.jpg?itok=8GBrn7_x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let's start with the Dark Father himself, Darth Vader! Vader is just as you'd expect him to be, a walking tank of death. With high health, the ability to force other friendly units around him to move, and the ability to make free attacks after moving - he's a serious problem once he gets into the fray.</p>

<p>His lightsaber can easily tear apart enemy tanks and infantry alike, and it's a risky move to shoot at him because he might just deflect your blasts back at you. I love the way these rules capture how terrifying it would be to actually face him on the battlefield.</p>

<p>From there, the list gets a little less complicated, but no less deadly! The basic Stormtroopers have the Precise keyword (hilarious), which allows them to spend aim tokens to re-roll their shots.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-legion-stormtroopers-scout-troopers.jpg?itok=IrZxuqeV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-legion-stormtroopers-scout-troopers.jpg?itok=OzuDLMBY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And the Scout Troopers actually have the exact same keywords as the Rebel Commandos, except that they can Scout ahead at a longer range - meaning they can get further into the battlefield when they're set up on the table.</p>

<h2><em>Star Wars Legion</em> Starter Sets Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Do the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Legion</em>&nbsp;Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance Starter Sets feel distinct from one another? Absolutely yes, as the Rebel Alliance is all about being harder to hit, while their commander Luke Skywalker hops around the battlefield. The Galactic Empire, on the other hand, feels more like the slow crawl of inevitable doom coming toward you. Vader doesn't move fast, but you're in extreme trouble when he makes contact.</p>

<p>You want to play your Rebels as a strike force, getting in and out while Luke and the Commandos move around the battlefield securing objectives. As a Galactic player, your goal is to give Vader covering fire as he plods toward objectives, slashing and dashing his way around the map.</p>

<p>This creates an incredible, dynamic tension between the two Starter Sets (which, as a reminder, aren't sold together - but I think it's worth showing them as contrasts to one another). With streamlined rules (mostly just quality of life upgrades and a major change to how units are deployed), these boxes are a smart, thoughtful introduction to the game. A must for wargaming and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;fans alike!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <em>Halo</em> meme as an ICE recruitment ad, likening immigrants to violent aliens. Microsoft has declined to comment on the twisted rhetoric, but some of the franchise’s former developers voiced their thoughts.</p> <p>The meme <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">posted on X on October 27</a> shows Master Chief and a fellow Spartan in a Warthog with a call to “DESTROY THE FLOOD.” It was a reference to an alien species that serves as one of the sci-fi shooter’s main antagonists; an infectious superorganism that consumes and destroys everything it touches. “Finishing this fight,” wrote DHS above the recruitment ad.</p>

 <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">with <em>Game File</em></a>, <em>Halo c</em>o-creator Marcus Lehto called the post “absolutely abhorrent” and added, “It really makes me sick seeing<em> Halo</em> co-opted like this.” Franchise veteran&nbsp;Jamie Griesemer, who was lead designer on both <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>Halo 3</em>, was similarly outraged.</p>

 <p>“Using <em>Halo</em> imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every <em>Halo</em> fan, regardless of political orientation,” he told <em>Game File</em>. “I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.“</p>

 <p>Pushing back against some fans claiming the original <em>Halo</em> games were a post-9/11 parable for fighting an army of invading religious zealots, Griesemer said it wasn’t an allegory for any specific religion or political movement. “The Prophets are not Popes, the Grunts are not Wahhabis, and the Flood are definitely not illegal immigrants,” he told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><em>Game File</em></a>. “The Master Chief is not a Christ figure and Cortana is not the Virgin Mary, I guess?”</p> <p><em>Halo</em>‘s collision with the Trump administration’s anti-immigration crackdown, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/10/28/chicago-s-children-are-getting-caught-chaos-immigration-crackdowns">which includes “lawless” ICE raids in cities like Chicago</a>, comes as Microsoft is trying to get fans hyped for a remake of the original game coming next year that will also serve as the franchise’s debut on PlayStation. At the same time, the tech giant is pledging support for Trump’s White House demolition and the building of a new ballroom as it seemingly tries to curry favor for government contracts and regulatory approvals related to its spiraling AI investments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">On October 28,<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest update</a>&nbsp;added Blackwell Fields, a new map, to the online FPS. This should be an exciting time for fans. However, Blackwell Fields is a very small, mostly empty map that isn’t much fun to play. And the community isn’t happy about it.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">I got a chance to go hands-on with Blackwell Fields</a> before it was added to the game as part of today’s larger season one update, which also added a new battle royale mode and battle pass system. And after playing a few matches on it back then, I was worried. Now having checked it out in the full game and watched others play it, I’m here to report that Blackwell Fields is one of <em>BF6</em>‘s worst maps yet.</p>

  <p>It’s an odd duck of a map that feels too big and empty when you’re running around on foot, but feels too small when you’re trying to use vehicles. Snipers are king on this map and will quickly take you out the moment you spawn. Blackwell Fields also lacks a lot of interesting spaces in which to fight, mostly just being an oil field with some hills to use as cover. Not great. Flying around the map is a pain, too, as it’s so small you’ll quickly hit the out-of-bounds and be forced to turn around. (Assuming you don’t just get shot down instantly, more on that in a moment.) And to top it all off, it’s just kind of a bleh-looking map with no real distinctive features or interesting visual theming. Brownish hills, some oil drills, a few dirt roads, and a handful of buildings. Enjoy!</p>

 <p>On the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/">reactions</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi63vz/these_boundaries_make_this_map_unnecessarily_small/">the new map</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi73om/blackwell_fields_is_another_clusterfuck_lane/">ranged from “This isn’t good”</a> to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8c4u/the_new_map_doesnt_bring_me_confidence_to_the/">This is very, very bad.</a>” Players aren’t happy with how small the map is and its oddly constrictive boundaries. People are also already tired of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi6sfk/a_quick_glance_at_the_new_map/">getting sniped over and over again</a> when spawning on squadmates, as the map lacks substantial cover.</p>

   <p>But perhaps the worst part of Blackwell Fields is that the main team bases are too damn close to each other. Players are reporting that when trying to take off in a jet at their own base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi882b/pax_armata_jets_can_be_locked_on_without_taking/">the other team’s AA guns</a>, located in the opposite base, can be used to destroy the aircraft. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/">Helis aren’t safe from this issue, either</a>. For many, it means that aircraft are effectively worthless on the map in its current state. Yikes! Further upsetting players is the fact that the new free battle royale spin-off, Redsec, features a massive map. But the paid game got such a tiny new map.</p> <p>Can Blackwell Fields be saved? Maybe. Opening it up would help, for sure, and maybe adding some more cover would, too. But really, I think EA should have just released the other new map arriving later this season, Eastwood, which is bigger and better in every way than Blackwell Fields. Unfortunately, unless something changes, that map won’t be added until a later update in November.</p>
