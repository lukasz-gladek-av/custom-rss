            <p>Developer GSC Game World said Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's first patch will respond directly to feedback from players.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415">update</a> posted to Steam over the weekend, the studio said it has identified a number of issues, and listed its priorities.</p>

<p>Memory allocation failures - "which previously caused the game to exit unexpectedly, particularly around rendering, skeletal meshes, and quest-related cutscenes" - are first on the list, followed by main quest progression issues, including NPCs getting stuck in objects, incorrect quest markers, and issues with quest cutscenes. Main quests like Visions of Truth or A Minor Incident will be revised "to ensure smooth transitions, avoiding rare cases of players not being able to proceed further".</p>
<p>Here's everything else scheduled for a fix in the first upcoming patch:</p>
<p>Gameplay and balance adjustments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing the price of the weapons with upgrades installed compared to their value without attachments.</li>
<li>NPCs behavior, including the way they act when lacking a shelter during the Emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cutscenes and visual fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely missing facial animations, misplaced NPCs, and visual inconsistencies like detached heads and clothes clipping.</li>
<li>Quality and stability improvements of the visual effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Softlock fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue where players were unable to close the trade screen after putting ammo in a wrong slot while playing on a gamepad.</li>
</ul>
<p>User interface improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest notifications now showed correctly during dialogues.</li>
<li>Corrected texts and missing interaction prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Noted to be addressed in future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analogue sticks dead zones bugfixes.</li>
<li>A-Life system bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now there's no word on when the patch will go live, but GSC Game World hinted it's coming "during the week to come" to both PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"The game has been out for several days now (it’s still surreal to say that), and we've been following your feedback in all possible forms carefully," the team said. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">To the more than one million stalkers in the Zone</a>, thanks for playing - that means the world to us."</p>
<p>"Full of anomalies in more ways than one, Stalker 2 is a mess of bugs and jank that nonetheless stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’ve been holding off on picking up Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, now is a good time to grab a copy: It’s on sale for a new all-time low price at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can snag it on PS5 or Xbox Series X for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bZrR?object_uuid=2c452c66-7f3e-4ca7-9d85-9c2498dc4de6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.99 at Amazon</a>, a healthy $20 discount.

The story is nice and twisty, pitting you and your fellow futuristic military men against the alien Tyranid forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re done with the campaign, there’s a whole lot of cosmetic gear and armor colors you can collect by playing co-op missions or online multiplayer matches. The whole game is just a great shooter that delivers on the fundamentals. Plus, it looks fantastic, having left behind the previous generation of consoles. You can read my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a> for more details to see whether it’ll appeal to you. I loved it, though, giving it an 8 out of 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the summary: “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied. “</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday discounts</a>, check out our roundups of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">PS5 deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-2024">Xbox deals</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo Switch deals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/11/22/introducing-microsoft-edge-game-assist-preview/">Microsoft Edge Game Assist</a> - currently available to try via an opt-in preview - is described as "a rich gaming-centric browsing experience" that lets you get help, track progress, listen to music or chat with friends without taking you out of the game.</p>

<p>Microsoft reckons 40 percent of PC players look up tips and guides whilst playing, and 88 percent use a browser whilst gaming to get help, which means we're forever interrupting our sessions by switching windows or monitors or grabbing our phones.</p><p>"Game Assist is a special version of Microsoft Edge that’s optimised for PC gaming and can appear on top of your game in Game Bar," Microsoft explained. "It's game-aware and will suggest tips and guides for what you're playing. It also shares the same browser data with Edge on your PC so the information you care about is always accessible while you play - including your favorites, history, cookies, form fills, and more.</p>
<p>"This means you don't need to log into sites again, and it's easy to get to what you care about. You can even quickly access your favorite services like Discord, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Spotify, or any other page or site in the sidebar. And, like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin Game Assist above your game so you can reference a guide or watch a video while you play."</p>
<p>You can access Game Assist (Preview) via a Game Bar that overlays your game if you have Microsoft Edge Beta 132 and Windows 11. If you're interested, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/edge/download/insider?form=MA13FJ">opt-in to the public preview</a> and then hit Win+G from within your Game Bar to access it.</p>
<p>Right now it only support English, though, and supports just a "selection of popular PC games": <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade 2</a>: Senua's Saga, League of Legends, Minecraft, Overwatch 2, Roblox, and Valorant.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax went on strike</a> in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union.</p>
<p>The one-day walkout by staff who work on Fallout, Starfield and Doom came after concerns over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2%E2%80%99s-next-update-will-target-crashes-quest-issues-and-ui-bugs.1043862/</guid>

<p>STALKER 2 has been on the market for three days, and it seems that for every person ranting about the game, there’s someone there singing the title’s praises. It’s a divisive game, that’s for sure – but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>, I gave it a 9/10 and recommended gamers everywhere invest at least a little time in the post-apocalyptic epic.</p>



<p>GSC Game World is hard at work patching up the game, addressing the bugs that have caused some users to leave negative reviews or order refunds of the game that took more than a decade to piece together.</p>



<p>The next update is said to be a doozy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-incoming">Changes Incoming</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, GSC Game World revealed that the next STALKER 2 update is a hefty one. It’s going to target some of the stickiest issues players have been dealing with since the game was released on November 20 on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issue and memory allocation failures (PC)</li>



<li>Main quest progression fixes (game-breaking bugs)</li>



<li>Gameplay balancing and adjustments (trader prices and NPC behaviour)</li>



<li>Cutscene fixes (facial animations and clipping)</li>



<li>‘Softlock’ fixes (menu freezing)</li>



<li>UI improvements (quest notifications, interaction prompts)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a future update, the team will work on ironing out bugs in the ‘A-Life’ system that powers the game’s AI-driven NPCs. It has been a notorious issue since the game dropped, with the intelligent, realistic AI that was promised not having been delivered.</p>



<p>GSC will also work to address controller-based issues, such as dead zone bug fixes.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure you once more that we will make every effort to constantly improve your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl experience. We are truly grateful for your feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr Disrespect Teases Relocation to Rumble in Recent Stream]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-teases-relocation-to-rumble-in-recent-stream.1043856/</guid>

<p>Dr Disrespect, the disgraced content creator who found himself at the centre of a dire scandal in recent months, has teased a departure from YouTube in favour of Rumble, a competing platform.</p>



<p>It all started with a new ‘DrDisrespect’ profile cropping up on Rumble, which according to <a href="https://streamscharts.com/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StreamsCharts.com</a> is the sixth largest streaming site by viewer numbers. From there, Rumble’s CEO posted a cryptic message on social media that many saw as a connection to Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>This move has come from Dr Disrespect’s failure to regain monetisation on YouTube, which he lost when he admitted to using Twitch to inappropriately message a minor in 2017.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-home-same-old-doc">New Home, Same Old Doc</h2>



<p>Rumble’s CEO has been flying in the face of controversy, refusing to acknowledge Dr Disrespect’s wrongdoing and seemingly teasing the scandalous creator’s impending arrival several times on social media. In a post on October 26, Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO, said that he’s securing the ‘biggest gaming streamer’ with a contract in 2025.</p>



<p>At the end of <a href="https://x.com/layer_cake/status/1860133482930094342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s most recent stream</a>, the veteran creator faded out with a cryptic sequence. His broadcast dropped to bars and tones before pivoting to a loading screen that read ‘Connection Redirected’. </p>



<p>Fans and critics alike have surmised that Dr Disrespect is about to announce a move to Rumble which could kickstart in 2025.</p>



<p>In June, the infamous streamer admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch several years ago but stressed that nothing criminal took place and that the business was long since settled. Regardless, he lost the support of hundreds of thousands of followers, had ties with other content creators cut, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by sponsorship partners</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the scandal, he returned to streaming in September and pulled in substantial numbers, with his core following standing firm in the face of blatant issues.</p>



<p>Will you be following Dr Disrespect over to Rumble? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>Modder HalkHogan has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-nextgen-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a>, the final version of his texture overhaul for CD Projekt RED's next-gen version of the open world RPG masterpiece. According to HalkHogan, though, the improvement is far more extensive than just a texture upscale.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is a project created from the heart that improves and reworks a huge amount of game assets (textures, models, materials and more), and the number of these changes can be counted in thousands. Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent, and as faithful as possible, reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of The Witcher. Now you can experience the most beautiful adventure yet with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ultra quality detailed lore-friendly textures (many of them are reworked to 4K)</em></li>
<li><em>Implemented relief mapping on many surfaces, making them look much more realistic and 3D now</em></li>
<li><em>High quality smooth and more detailed models</em></li>
<li><em>Better object LODs (level of models details from distance) and increased draw distance for many objects</em></li>
<li><em>Specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked assets, that give the objects and surfaces a more realistic look</em></li>
<li><em>Everything consistent with the original CD Projekt RED artistic vision of The Witcher 3</em></li>
</ul>

            <p>Developer Asobo has advised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> players to "move your community packages" if they experience persistent stability issues or long loading times.</p>
<p>In a notice appended to the 1.1.9.0 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now">release notes</a>, Asobo noted that outdated packages in the Community Folder could adversely impact performance, adding that relocating the packages to another folder and relaunching the game should help.</p>

<p>"If you are playing on PC, outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behaviour," the statement said. "If you suffer from stability issues or long loading times, move your Community package(s) to another folder before relaunching the title."</p><p>The patch itself also addresses a crash when you select "As Arrival" in the EFB, a crash that could occur when "closing and invoking the Camera menu after changing the Drone focus mode option to a value other than undefined", as well as "various" other crashes across the title".</p> <div>

<p>A few other "general" bug fixes have also been resolved, including the missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in popup, a problem where you could lose focus when creating a new input profile, and a bug wherein the aircraft selection is accessible via the control menu, but can only be changed from the home page.</p>
<p>It also fixes an issue where you could get stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-studio-apologises-for-issues-as-it-increases-server-capacity">the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team apologised to its community</a> for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting, "this is not the launch experience we want for our players", admitting it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch.</p>
<p>In related news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-borrowed-all-its-animals-from-planet-zoo">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 borrowed all its animals from Planet Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>"I called my friend, the CEO. His name is Jonny [Watts], and I said, 'Hey, Jonny, I'm working on Flight Sim, can I have your animals from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a>?' And he's like, 'Yeah, why not?'," said Flight Simulator boss Jorg Neumann. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Intel Arc B580</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Battlemage BGM-G21</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Clock Speed</td><td>2.8 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>12GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Speed</td><td>19 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>456 GB/s</td></tr><tr><td>PCIe</td><td>5.0 x8</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

The “game-aware” overlay lives in the Microsoft Game Bar and is designed to automatically find and show you links to tips and guides for the game you’re playing, using the Edge browser.</p><p>Game Assist uses the profile you’re logged into in Edge, so it’ll give you access to your data, like cookies, autofill, and favorites, so “you don’t need to log into sites again.” Like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin it above your game as you play. Game Assist is currently available in English, and you’ll need to opt into the preview and set Microsoft Edge Beta 132 as your default browser to use it.</p><p>Here’s a video of the feature in action: </p><p>You’ll have to find content yourself for most games for now, but the game-aware part of Game Assist will surface information automatically for a few games, including <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, </em>and <em>Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</em>. Microsoft says it’ll be adding support for others “throughout the preview and over time.”</p><p>In a second video, Microsoft shows how the overlay looks when used to follow along with video guides:</p><p>Microsoft says it’s collecting feedback in a few ways: </p><div><blockquote><p>You can share your feedback in Game Assist by going to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Send feedback</strong>. You can also vote on which features you want to see added to Game Assist using the new&nbsp;<a href="https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/9612778f-73a0-ef11-8a69-000d3a4e63db">Game Assist Community feedback portal</a>, and we’ll be monitoring feedback on&nbsp;<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge">r/MicrosoftEdge</a>, X, and other social channels as well.</p></blockquote></div><p>Game Assist only supports mouse and keyboard input for the moment, but Microsoft writes it’s adding support for handhelds and gamepads in the future. Compact Mode support is also coming later, the company says.</p><p>Below are Microsoft’s instructions for getting started with Game Assist.</p><div><ul><li>Make sure Windows 11 and Game Bar are up to date.</li><li>Game Assist requires the Beta or Preview channel of Microsoft Edge. If you’re running Windows Insider builds on your PC or have opted into Edge Preview, you already have Edge Preview and can skip to Step 3.

            <p>Riot Games has pulled a promotional poster after fans pointed out it seemed to have been made using AI.</p>
<p>After thanking an eagle-eyed viewer for pointing out the strangeness of a hand in banner art on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> itself, Riot Games called the image "a mistake [that] has since been removed" and asserted its "strict stance" against AI.</p>

<p>ICYMI, indie game platform<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-game-platform-itchio-now-requires-developers-to-tag-ai-content"> Itch.io now requires developers to disclose whether generative AI has been used in their work</a>. The platform recently detailed its new tagging requirement, specifying it is a required field for asset creator pages "to ensure buyers are aware of the origins of the material they are obtaining".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
